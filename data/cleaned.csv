0,506,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Fire destroyed the workshops of an installation producing welded wire containers,2003-06-30 02:00:00,2003-06-30 00:00:00,"One Monday morning a fire destroyed the 14,000 m² of workshops of an installation producing welded wire containers.This accident is notified due to the relevance of the material damage and loss of production estimated at 22,000,000 Euro.","The hypothesis of an accidental fire is being considered, the fire could have started in two electrical equipment boxes releasing automatically the heating of the pickling baths several hours before the first shift started. A criminal action causing the accident is not excluded, considering the fact that signs of intrusion and indications of several fires being started were found.","Material damage and loss of production damage on the site are estimated at 22,000,000 Euro, while 1,000,000 Euro had been invested over 2 years in technical improvement measures.","50 fire fighters participated in the emergency response action to control the fire. The Classified Installation Inspectorate suggested issuing an urgent prefectural decree requesting the operator to put up beacons to mark the site, restrict access and install rain protection systems in the polluted areas, dispose of liquid waste and asbestos through authorised companies as well as the analyse the ground in different parts of the installation.",Reinforce the&nbsp;fight against intrusion
1,385,Major Accident,Plastic and rubber manufacture,Release of hazardous substances (phenol-water solution) from the dosing system of a chemical reactor,2002-06-03 00:00:00,2002-06-03 00:00:00,"Release of hazardous substances from the dosing system of a chemical reactorReleasing event / accident dynamics: On 03/06/2002 hazardous substances were released&nbsp; from the dosing system of a reactor. Consequent to&nbsp; this event an employee was fatally injured. At the time of the occurrence the dosage system was undergoing technical modifications with the goal of increasing the dosage range of formaldehyde. The modification consisted in adding two ball valves to the two existing control valves in order to increase the technical safety of the system. To perform the modification disassembling of the two existing control valves and of partial pipe sections was necessary.An employee was given the job of preparing the disassembling operation by disconnecting the pneumatic and the electric connections from the valve bodies and installing the connections for the pneumatic and electric control of the new ball valves.These operations were prepared correctly and partially performed. At the time of the occurrence one of the control valves still had to be&nbsp; installed and consequently the pneumatic and electrical control systems were not connected.The point in which the valve was to be installed was not sealed.Approximately 30 litres of a 93% phenol-water solution at 508 C were released by an operational error of the employee, who activated via a function switch the opening and closing of a pneumatic ball valve in the phenol dosage section. The employee was severely&nbsp; burnt on his lower left body. Logically he left the accident place and rapidly went to the emergency&nbsp; shower in order to rinse his body and his clothes. There he lost control and fell unconscious.","Due to an unexplainable reason the employee opened the
phenol-water solution dosing valve to the reactors which was located in
front of him. The phenol contained in that section was partially
released through the opening.
This opening was located approximately 0.5 m from his left shoe.
Approximately 30 litres of water-phenol solution released from the
opening hit a flange in front and sprayed the employee, who was
severely burnt on both his feet and his lower left body. The employee
must have immediately noticed his error and rapidly closed the valve.
He rapidly climbed down from his working place and was probably hit on
other parts of his body by dripping phenol-water solution. He walked
very rapidly to the emergency shower some 30 metres away and rinsed his
body and his clothes.&nbsp;
",not given,Safety function: - shut-down of the circulation by switching off the pump and closing the two valves upstream and downstream from the pump;- closing of the main valve- flushing of the formaldehyde system in the reactor with water and emptying of the piping by vacuum pressure.The main valve was closed as a precautionary measure even if work was not performed on the phenol system.Additionally to the obligatory clothing a protective mask with a type A brown filter (organic vapours and solvents) and protective gloves were defined as mandatory personal protection equipment.The regulations concerning the personal protection equipment were mandatory for the fitters.

2,1016,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Sludge overflow at a petrochemical site,2010-08-01 09:30:00,2010-08-05 22:20:00,"Sludge bulking caused by the growth of filamentous bacteria in the biological treatment plant for industrial effluents at a large chemical site. Organic sludge decanting in the clarifiers was rendered impossible, causing the sludge to overflow into the final physicochemical treatment plant, which rapidly became saturated. Effluent leaving the plant was discharged into the natural environment (first into the river Merle and then into the Rosselle). The water became brown and turbid. The official limits values for SM (suspended matter), COD (chemical oxygen demand) and BOD5 (biological oxygen demand under 5 j) were significantly exceeded at the point of exit from the plant. The potentially affected river Rosselle flows into the Saar in Germany. The German authorities have been informed by the Civil Protection authorities via cross-border procedures. The operator informed the authority for the inspection of classified installations and drew up a press release on 4 August.","The operator is considering several possible explanations for the appearance of filamentous bacteria: accidental destruction of biomass, lack of oxygenation, nutrient deficiency, variation in gross load at the entrance to the plant, adverse climatic conditions (high temperature)",The potentially affected river Rosselle flows into the Saar in Germany. The German authorities have been informed by the Civil Protection authorities via cross-border procedures.,"The following action was taken as soon as the anomaly was discovered: decrease in hydraulic load, testing of alternative flocculents, chlorination then re-inoculation of the plant. Before being discharged into the natural environment, the effluent is treated by large mobile units (filtration and coagulation/flocculation/decanting) starting from the fifth day (operating cost: EUR 0.5 m). Production has been slowed down in several sections on the site until the treatment plants are brought back into operation; one has been stopped, while the operation of two others has been reduced to 30-50%, resulting in high operating losses. Some of the effluent that feeds the biological treatment plant is being kept in storage in order to limit the organic load at the entrance to the plant. Medium-term surveillance of the environment has been put in place in order to assess the impact of the accident (ecotoxicological testing of Daphnia). An unannounced check carried out by the authority for the inspection of classified installations 10 days after the accident found that the effluents discharged into the environment were in compliance with the rules in force.","A study of the water treatment works at the site should eventually be carried out in order to justify their size (closure of several installations, with the result that the water treatment works are oversized)."
3,257,Major Accident,"Waste storage, treatment and disposal",Accident  in a waste oil de-oiling storage tank during maintenance,1990-02-06 01:30:00,1990-02-06 00:00:00,"SAFETY SYSTEMS OR OPERATORS INTERVENTION:The pumping of the fuel/water mixture to the storage tank was halted. The cooling of the neighbouring tanks was activated.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Stormy weather.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The accident occurred in a waste oil de-oiling storage tank where waste oil and other contaminated flammable liquid wastes, like toluene and xylene, were separated out by gravity from the water contents. Water was discharged from the bottom of the tank and the floating fuel used in treatment furnaces.The vapours displaced during transfer operations were passed through an active carbon filter. Owing to self-overheating in this absorption unit, the vapours ignited; as no flame arrestors had been installed, a flashback occurred to the de-oiling tank. The following explosion (deflagration) tore the roof partly loose from the sidewall and destroyed the cooling unit and foam chamber of the tank. The subsequent fire also threatened other storage tanks, and a boil-over danger existed.&nbsp; Fire brigades of the company, a neighbouring Shell Chemical factory and from local and regional communities were activated to fight the fire. Cooling of the neighbouring tanks by means of their water-cooling rings and additional portable/mobile fire fighting equipment employed by the fire brigade was started to prevent escalation. The tank was left to burn until adequate foam concentrate and water pumping capacity were available to undertake a successful foam attack using monitors (a second foam unit was on stand-by to fight pitfires should a boil-over occurred). Additional fire fighting water had to be supplied by a fire fighting boat because one of the two fire fighting water pumps of the installation failed. After the fire had been extinguished, the contents of the remaining tank were cooled down and, several days later, to the furnaces.","CAUSES:The vapours displaced from the waste oil de-oiling tank during transfer operations were passed through an active carbon filter. Owing to self-heating in this absorption unit, the vapours ignited. As no flame arrestors had been installed (due to an inadequate plant design and to an insufficient process analysis), a flashback occurred to the de-oiling tank resulting in an explosion (deflagration) inside it.","People - Remarks: No people were injured during the accident.Material loss - Remarks: Apart from damage to the tank construction, many electrical pumps were damaged owing to flooding by cooling and firefighting water. No data are available about the cost of the damages.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire that followed the explosion also threatened the other storage tanks, and a boil-over danger existed.&nbsp; Fire brigades of the company, a neighbouring Shell Chemical factory and from local and regional communities were activated to fight the fire.

The roof of intermediate store, parts of shelf, walls and ceilings and the entire enclosed fire alarm plant were destroyed. As cause of the fire it is suspected an autoignition from the chemical laboratory over samples of dangerous materials. In the course of the fire were affected by the flames also organic and inorganic chemicals from trade and industry like various acids, leach and nickel-cadmium accumulators. Concerning the formation of dioxine result various measures of ash and soil samples, that had been performed by the Water Economy and by Soil Security offices of the city nearby, they were of so small value that dying from the visibility of the soil security no other measures were necessary.",Chemical reaction.

6,3,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of acetonitrile from a chemical wastewater drainage system at a chemical plant,2015-05-12 00:00:00,2015-05-12 00:00:00,"A hole formed in a chemical wastewater shaft, resulting in the release of contaminated chemical wastewater into the soil. The shaft is fitted with a protective coating (acid-proof liner and lead coating).&nbsp;
– A mobile gas measurement device was activated during a site inspection by the operator.– All shafts on the site were inspected.– The wastewater register was updated to include the substance acetonitrile.– Clarification of further measures with the regional government office and professional specialists.","– Damage to the inlet shaft went unnoticed.– Deficient inspection routine. The root causes can be traced to two sources. Firstly, the restructuring following a change of operator when the site was bought in 2003 plays a role. As part of that process, the in-house masonry department, which had until that time carried out inspections and maintenance of the chemical wastewater shafts, was dismantled. There was a lack of awareness of what this step would mean for plant safety or of the need to replace the department. The second main cause was a lack of coordination between the operator and the VAwS expert on regular inspections. The operator was clearly not sure what exactly had to be inspected and to what extent. Moreover, the expert’s notes give little information about the testing activities, the condition of the tested equipment and equipment components and the scope of the tests. The entry ‘OK’ on testing reports provides little information without further clarification.",Damage to property within the operating area of buildings and sewers as well as contamination of the groundwater.,"– Immediate end to letting chemical wastewater flow into the drainage system.– The shaft was emptied.
– The chemical wastewater was diverted to other inlets.– Possible building washout is to be assessed.– Cleaning of the outlet shaft, review of the building’s structural analysis.– The contaminated groundwater will be pumped out.– Expected start week&nbsp;45 of 2015.– Study commissioned on the degradation of acetonitrile in groundwater.
Model-based description of the movement of groundwater commissioned from the Tübingen Groundwater Research Institute (TGF) using the groundwater model from the municipality of Grenzach-Wyhlen based on previous incidents.","Most of the chemical wastewater shafts have now been inspected and the inspections will be completed by the end of 2016; no further leaks have yet been found.In the future, all chemical wastewater shafts will be inspected on an annual basis.The authority is kept constantly informed about inspection activities and results. The lessons that can be learnt from this are:– A change of operator and associated technical and organisations changes can have a considerable impact on plant safety. Of particular importance are aspects concerning plant integrity (inspection, upkeep and maintenance). The impact on safety may not become apparent for a considerable time. The safety management system must also take into consideration organisational changes. It is recommended that such organisational changes are also taken into consideration by the authorities in conjunction with supervision.– A lack of coordination of regular inspection and testing measures may lead to incorrect interpretations when assessing the state of the equipment.– Clear findings with written descriptions and images are therefore required in order to establish the scope and detail of the inspection and the methods used. The inspection report (results) should contain a comprehensible description of the inspection carried out and an expert opinion. In particular, the results of visual inspections should be explained."

9,1189,Near Miss,Wood treatment and furniture,Release of cooking acid (pulping liquor) and sulphur dioxide in a pulp production plant,2019-05-11 04:55:00,2019-05-11 07:20:00,"Corrosion-related bursting of a DN 80 stainless steel clad blind flange on a container.04:55:Alarm given by internal gas sensors, prompt search for the leak, which was detected shortly afterwards on a container.05:04:First ""2 ppm"" pre-alarm at the Gate 1 gas detection unit, which is connected to an emergency control room.05:10:Installation and commissioning of two water curtains.05:14:Second ""2 ppm"" pre-alarm at Gate 1 gas detection unit.05:20:Employee of the boiler house blocks access through Gate 1 (carrying breathing apparatus).05:23:Start emptying the container by pumping its contents into empty digesters.05.33:""&gt;4 ppm"" gas alarm at Gate 1 gas detection unit, thus automatically alerting the fire brigade.05:39:Arrival of the fire brigade and parts of the on-site fire brigade – assessment of the situation, closure of a main road at the site.06:00:Container emptied, no more leakage of cooking acid. Start pumping the cooking acid that has flowed into the catch pan towards the measuring tank and onwards for processing in the evaporation system.07:05:Clearance measurements taken by fire brigade measuring vehicle.07:22:All clear given, fire brigade stands down and leaves.Safety measures:Internal gas sensors made it possible to locate the leak quickly. The gas warning system at Gate 1 triggered an automatic alarm to the emergency control room and to all staff at the plant.155 m³ of the cooking acid contained in the container could thus be pumped into an empty digester, with the result that only 10 m³ of cooking acid escaped into the catch pan.The plant’s own water curtains were immediately set up. The fire brigade was very quickly at the scene and closed a main road passing in front of the site.The safety system worked very well.","The release was caused by the corrosion of a stainless steel clad DN 80 blind flange on a cooking acid container.The most likely mechanism is mechanical damage to the welded stainless steel cladding, which allowed cooking acid to reach the underlying black steel.Corrosion of the black steel was able to continue undetected until it burned through the blind flange. This was followed by a very rapid erosion of the material and a widening of the corrosion hole.The cooking acid container was built in 1965. The extent to which the blind flanges also date back to that year is unknown, but it cannot be ruled out.The tank was originally constructed as a digester and was sold second-hand many years ago to the current plant operator, where it has since been used as a high pressure (approximately 7 bar) storage tank.There was no monitoring of the blind flanges.",Three injured workers.,"Staff were alerted by internal gas sensors so that the leak was quickly detected. Installation of the plant’s own water curtains to reduce impacts. Blocking of access to the works by its own staff (with appropriate protective equipment). Automatic alerting of the emergency control room by gas sensors. Container emptied by pumping its contents into an empty digester, pumping of the cooking acid that had leaked into the catch pan to the evaporation system. Closure of a main road in front of the site and final clearance measurement by the fire brigade.","Replace the stainless steel clad blind flange cover with solid stainless steel flange cover on the container.Additional check on the thickness of the material and the weld on the lower cone of the container by an external specialist firm (non-destructive material test).Putting into service of the container only after further internal checks and strength testing by an authorised testing body.Wall thickness checks of similar clad blind flange covers in the lower pressure level containers and, if necessary, replacement with solid stainless steel blind flanges.The lessons learned from this event are complex:- The fact that undetected corrosion could take place shows the importance of identifying such potential sites and using appropriate non-destructive test methods on a regular basis. In this case, for example, sound emission tests would be one way of promptly detecting the formation of corrosion voids behind the cladding.- The age of the equipment certainly plays an important role, as more modern containers are usually equipped with 100% stainless steel blind flanges.- The lessons can also be applied to reactors with other corrosion-resistant coatings.- Where damage to the protective layer may occur, as a result of which the more sensitive layer is exposed and the damage is not detected in good time, a disastrous break-through and release of substances can occur. Accordingly, the maintenance and inspection plans relating to such systems must be reviewed and, if necessary, amended.- Aging installations for which complete history documentation may not be available must be treated with a commensurate level of caution.Examine whether additional gas sensors in the area of cooking acid treatment can help to locate leaks more quickly."

12,145,Major Accident,Chemical installations - other fine chemicals,Fire in an oxygen compressor in an acetylene plant,2011-05-30 09:55:00,2011-05-30 15:03:00,"The cause of the fire is not yet clear. A member of staff discovered the fire as a result of the formation of smoke. He immediately alerted the fire brigade which, after a few minutes on site with fire engines and turbo extinguishers, had the fire under control and then cooled the adjacent parts of the plant. The plant was automatically shut down as a result of the reduction in pressure of the oxygen. The dynamics of the shut-down operation resulted in flares becoming extinguished. The fire also caused a partial failure of the supply of control air. It was not possible to re-ignite the flares until that failure had been rectified, and approx. 1 000 kg of unburned naphthalene was emitted.At 9.55 a.m. on 30 May 2011, there was a fire in an oxygen compressor in an acetylene plant.
A member of staff discovered the fire as a result of the formation of smoke. He immediately alerted the fire brigade, which, after a few minutes on site with fire engines and turbo extinguishers, had the fire under control and then cooled the adjacent parts of the plant.
The fire was extinguished and the subsequent cooling measures were completed by 10.44 a.m.
The plant was automatically shut down. Cabling running above the compressor was damaged in the fire. This led, among other things, to a failure in the supply of control air from two flares and prevented the flares from being ignited. This failure caused up to approximately 600 kg of crude naphthalene to be released, unburnt by the damaged flares, between 10.37 a.m. and 2.59 p.m.
There was no harm to people or the environment. The material damages are concentrated in the area of the oxygen compressor and other technical equipment located in the area affected by the fire.
No individual person actively made a mistake. A hot spot created by a foreign body in the machine is considered to be the cause.
Safety measure:The plant was automatically shut down as a result of the reduction in pressure of the oxygen.","The final conclusion is that the most likely cause of the present damage is a hot spot in a compressor starting a metal fire in the lower casing.
This hot spot may have been caused by a foreign body which entered the machine through the inlet. Sufficient frictional heat to ignite metal may have been generated upon impact with a turbine blade or after acceleration and deflection upon impact with the wall of the inner casing of the machine.
Particular evidence for this chain of events is provided by the fact that when the trapping sieve (fitted on the inlet of the oxygen blower) was removed after the incident it was found to have mechanical damage and to contain a hole. It had been punctured. It is therefore obvious that a foreign body had entered the machine and triggered the incident.",One person with suspected shock Fire damage to parts of plant (EUR 2 000 000),Internal: The on-site fire brigade used water to cool the parts of the plant for the duration of the fire. External: Alerting of the surrounding plants.,"- All trapping sieves were removed and checked for particles and damage. The inlet pipes were also checked for loose parts at the access points to the oxygen blowers.
- Energy pipelines and signal lines damaged in the fire were removed from the critical areas that would be affected by a similar incident.
- In addition to the cut-offs that had already been installed (pressure cut-off inlet low/outlet high, bearing lubricant oil temperature high/oil pressure low, axial thrust high), a temperature monitor has been fitted to the fire/noise protection casing of the blower, with an alarm in the measuring station, in order to be able to detect an increase in temperature even earlier, if necessary.
- There are important supply lines in the area of the blowers. A sprinkler system will be installed there as soon as possible in order to be able to provide intensive cooling in a short space of time. Water is supplied both by means of a fixed pipeline (deionised water network) and by means of a water hydrant, which can be connected by the fire brigade in an emergency.
- The safe operation of the flares was discussed in detail with the operator. In order to optimise ignition of the burners, a trial is being carried out on one acetylene flare and one lean gas flare in which conventional ignition is replaced by self-priming, electric ignition that does not rely on compressed air. If successful, the cracked gas flares will be retrofitted with this system."
13,398,Major Accident,"Power generation, supply and distribution ",Explosion at an underground  natural gas storage facility,2004-04-23 09:40:00,2004-04-23 00:00:00,"Explosion at an underground  natural gas storage facility with explosion and fire damage to premises and technical equipment in the probe area, and in particular to the probe head of the underground gas storage facility.
Three people inside and six people outside the installation were injured

Cause/sequence of events: A specialist firm carried out treatment work inside the probe to improve its conveyancing capacity. During the work to recover processing liquid (free conveyancing work) there was an explosion at the probe followed by a fire.","Cause status: the accident was probably caused by an unsuitable substance (H2O2) used during routine probe treatment work to increase the productivity of the probe.

The cause has not yet been definitively determined, not least because the procedure to ascertain the damage in the underground probe area and specialist investigations have not yet been concluded.
","Material damage inside the installation: explosion and fire damage to premises and technical equipment in the probe area, and in particular to the storage probe. Damage outside the plant; 
- some windows were damaged in the explosion.

Three people inside and six people outside the installation were injured

",Safety function: the underground gas storage probes and thus also the storage probe concerned are fitted with a range of safety devices which can be used to regulate and shut off the gas flow inside the probe. It was possible to stop the uncontrolled gas leak by closing the so-called Shear Preventer.Emergency measures: safety measures: a large number of fire teams were deployed after the explosion and cooled the probe with water. Specialist firms were also called in to secure the probe. The police sealed off roads outside the premises as a precautionary measure.The efforts of the onsite and offsite emergency response services were well coordinated.Damage repaired: specialist firms have been put in charge of repairing damage inside the plant area. The minor damage caused outside the plant (broken glass) has been repaired. Safety measures by offsite emergency response services: fire fighting;Evacuation measures by offsite&nbsp; emergency response services: 43 people were evacuated from neighbouring allotment gardens from 10.46 am - 11.53 am as a precautionary measure.,"Measures to prevent recurrence:Following the emergency response measures implemented directly after the accident, operations to re-establish the functionality of the probe head were started on the basis of a specific work program. It was noticed that the probe's inner channel is blocked from a depth of approx. 4.20 m and it is therefore not possible to examine the underground part of the probe using the equipment currently available. For this reason, the operator of the underground gas storage installation is developing a new work program which includes a risk assessment for the measures to be implemented. The program is designed to ensure that the probe can drive over its full extent, to supervise the dismantling of the probe and to restore the probe to a safe condition for mining.Restriction measures:&nbsp; In future, only staff directly involved in the work will be on the site inside the plant for the duration of the operation."
14,562,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion following the leak and fire of synthesis gas from a valve joint in a nitrogen-based chemicals and fertilisers farm,2006-06-01 00:00:00,2006-06-01 03:30:00,"A leak of synthesis gas from a valve joint was ignited and the flame played on pipework containing the gas. This led to ductile failure of the pipework and the instantaneous large release of synthesis gas, resulting in an explosion.  The fire continued to burn for about two hours, due to the remaining gas inventory continuing to burn from the pipe rupture point.","The failure of a valve joint between the top and bottom halves of the valve appears to be the locus of leak, but the cause of the joint failure is not clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The leaking synthesis gas was ignited by physical conditions, and the flame played on the pipework containing the gas, causing ductile failure due to the heating effect. A large release of gas led to an explosion. The gas continued to burn until the inventory no longer sustained it. The gas inventory was reduced when operators were alerted to the initial fire from the valve.","The damage caused by the fire and explosion placed the plant out of action for about six weeks.  Repair costs are estimated by the company to be in region of 2 million euros.
Two employees suffered minor injuries during the explosion.&nbsp; ","The incident was initially attended by the contracted emergency service, SembCorp Ltd, followed by the local authority fire service. At the height of the incident, approximately 10 fire appliances were in attendance.&nbsp; The Police were also involved in restricting access to the site and providing helicopter response.The company set up an emergency response centre at an off-site location.","As the cause of the initial leak is not clear, the company have repaired the plant as pre-incident.  The valve involved has been replaced by a different manufactured type."
15,61,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Acrylic acid explosion,2012-09-29 14:35:00,2012-09-29 15:00:00,"On September 29, 2012, an explosion occurred at the Nippon Shokubai Plant in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. The explosion and subsequent fire in an acrylic acid intermediate tank killed one person and injured 36. The high temperature section which was not effectively cooled was formed in the upper section of the liquid stored in V-3138 and remained stagnant for a significant period of time. This has resulted in DAA formation and increased the liquid temperature further with the heat of dimerization. Since then, the liquid temperature reached the temperature which started the polymerization reaction. With the heat of polymerization reaction, the temperature increased even further. This caused V-3138 content to boil and built up V-3138 pressure until V-3138 started to crack. V-3138 content started to leak from the cracks, which caused the pressure to drop drastically and BLEVE occurred thereafter. As a result, V-3138 ruptured, scattered content ignited and caused the fire.","The investigation has concluded the following direct causes, which led into the explosion and fire of intermediate tank V-3138: Even though high temperature of rectifying column bottom liquid was building up inside V-3138, the fact that the circulation of Recycle to Top was not commissioned caused insufficient cooling to the tank liquid. This resulted in acrylic acid remaining stagnant for a significant period of time at high temperature. Although it was known to the company that DAA would form at a faster rate at high temperature, there was still insufficient recognition of the potential risk of heat of DAA formation which could increase the liquid temperature, and lead to this accident. Due to lack of thermometers and inadequate temperature monitoring, it was not possible to detect the abnormal condition until the polymerization proceeded. Failure in “Management of Change (MOC)” The rule of MOC was established in 2004 at this plant. The testing conditions for the load up test were thought to be adjusted within the range of equipment capacity, the rectifying column load was within the operating range of the past track records and the liquid volume to store in V-3138 was within the tank’s nominal capacity.","Fatality: 1 (firefighter) Severely injured: 5 (2 firefighters and 3 employees) Moderately injured: 13 (8 firefighters, 1 police officer, and 4 employees) Lightly injured: 18 (14 firefighters, 1 police officer, and 3 employees) Total: 37 persons The tank involved was destroyed and its surrounding equipment, racks, piping, cables, etc., were damaged.","13:25, Operators started spraying water onto V-3138. 13:40, liquid level of V-3138 reached out-ofrange limit (84.8m3). The self fire fighting team was alerted. 14:00, the self fire fighting team started spraying water onto V-3138. 14:02, the public fire department was arrived. 14:35, V-3138 exploded.","An analysis of this accident provided perspective on the following technical and organisational lessons: The updating of operational documentation must strictly correspond to all process changes; A technical or procedural modification to a process, even minor in nature, can fundamentally alter the initial risk analysis and, with it, the design of safety barriers; Technician training and drills must also focus on infrequent and extraordinary phases, such as equipment testing; For each product displaying risks of ignition, decomposition or runaway reaction, the control parameters deemed critical, e.g. the outcome of a HAZOP analysis, must be subject to continuous monitoring by technical staff throughout all process stages; Regular communication with follow-up is necessary between the design, maintenance and operations teams."

17,742,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Fire of sodium dichlorisocyanurate  and release of  chlorine and chlorine compounds toxic cloud,2003-07-17 20:10:00,2003-07-17 23:10:00,"Fire of sodium dichlorisocyanurate (SDIC, dichloroisocyanuric acid sodium salt CAS 2893-78-9) associated with the release of chlorine and chlorine compounds, forming a toxic cloud which affected neighbouring urban areas. The off-site emergency plan was released and the potentially affected population sheltered-in-place. It was agreed with the operator to classify the accident at level 3 of the accident gravity scale (noxious effects offsite the plant premises).Precipitation: NoneTemp.: 26Wind speed: 6.5 m/sDirection: 139°Meteorological conditions: wind speed from 20:00 h to 21:00 h 6.5 m/sec direction 139°; from 21:00 h to 22:00 h 6.5 m/sec 4 m/s, direction 132°; from 22:00 h to 23:00 h 1.5 m/sec 4 m/s, direction 37°, temperature changing from 26°C to 29°CBetween 20:00 hrs and 20:15 hrs on 17th July 4 workers were present in the plant, including the shift supervisor, when one of the workers detected smoke originating from the transit area where 37 tons of product were stored. The worker reached the area with a portable extinguisher and gas mask and found two rows of 1 tonne bags containing anhydrous sodium dichlorisocyanurate on the extreme left of the area and placed at a distance of 50 cm from each other. He could distinguish two piles of big bags in the front and another two big bags on the ground a bit more to the right. He declared that he could see smoke rising from the wooden pallet placed under the bag pile and the bottom bag on the right. He emptied the portable extinguisher, found another two and emptied them too but could not stop the combustion process and smoke development.The product leaking from the big bag at the bottom of the pile caused the two bags above to crash on the ground, feeding the combustion process, developing flames and intensive smoke.Meanwhile two other workers who had been alerted by the main alarm siren of the chlorine detectors reached the area shortly after the first worker and the shift supervisor sent them to the chlorine storage area.&nbsp; They connected an extinguishing hose to the manifold of two pumps feeding from two 10m3 water tanks, which were used for operations under normal conditions. The tanks are located approximately 20 metres from the area affected by the fire. Shortly after the extinguishing hose had been connected and a small amount of water had been&nbsp; pumped, the two pumps failed because the flames had reached the electric cable rack suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground and passing parallel to the front side of the transit area (located above the passage of the drainage channel). When the shift supervisor realised that the emergency response operation was impossible he alerted the security personnel of the plant and attempted to alert the fire brigade and the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (Centro de Emergencias de Catalunya - CECAT) but the telephone line was interrupted due to the fact that the telephone line also passes above the area in which the fire broke out.One of the workers, looking for a telephone, tried to kick open the entrance door of the administration offices but broke the glass with his foot and cut his leg (the injury was considered as not serious).At 20:43 hrs the emergency call number 112 received a phone call from a private citizen informing them that a fire had broken out in an industrial installation and the information was transmitted to the fire brigade.When local police officers of the Catalonian autonomous police force (Mossos d'Esquadra) arrived&nbsp; at the plant entrance and saw flames and smoke rising, they alerted the fire brigade.At 20:51 hrs a fire brigade helicopter making a routine flight over the area reported that the size of the smoke cloud was large and that chlorine could be smelled.The safety manager of the company arrived and at 20:58 hrs alerted the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (CECAT), responsible for releasing the Off-site Emergency Plan, informing them that the fire was significant and that it was releasing chlorine into the atmosphere.At 20:50 hrs the fire brigade arrived on-site, the fire brigade was informed by the representatives of the operator about the fire, the release of chlorine and the need to employ self-contained breathing apparatus. The fire was spreading rapidly, affecting the installations passing through the roofing and the roofing panels of the transit area. At 20:58 hrs, after extinguishing operations had been started, the chief officer of the fire brigade informed the Control Room that a chlorine cloud was forming.At 21:05 hrs the officer requested activation of the off-site emergency response plan.At 21:11 hrs the off-site emergency plan was activated, the municipalities located downwind and potentially affected by the cloud were informed about the occurrence and were requested to alert the population to immediately take shelter.The first fire fighters reaching the site found one extinguishing system of the company out of order due to a missing pressure device.At 21:49 hrs the fire was extinguished and the control room was notified.At 22:15 hrs the on-site emergency&nbsp; plan was called off andAt 23:00 hrs the off-site emergency&nbsp; plan was called off.","Combustion of sodium dichlorisocyanurate ( SDIC, dichloroisocyanuric acid sodium salt CAS 2893-78-9) and production of toxic fumes containing chlorine. On the morning of the accident during packaging operations of anhydrous SDIC in big bags, a big bag had ruptured in the transit area. It is assumed that part of the product reached the drainage channel and ignited on coming into contact with grease, oils, water and other organic residues.Full report remarks:The operator supposes that most probably the anhydrous sodium dichlorisocyanurate, spilled during the morning from a big bag on the ground, reached the drainage channel, starting a decomposition reaction in contact with water; this formed a white cloud and ignited the fire.According to the accident dynamics and to the interviews with the personnel a deliberate action appears not to be probable.","On-site there was material damage and a person was cut by broken glass and slightly injured. Four neighbouring municipalities were affected by the toxic smoke, which caused irritation to eyes and respiratory tract.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localThe real size of the off-site population affected is unknown. Initially the smoke cloud was moving towards the two nearest municipalities, later the wind direction changed. For this reason the municipalities lying nearby, which could have been potentially affected by the cloud, were informed about the occurrence and were requested to alert the population to immediately take shelter.The municipalities alerted are the ones mentioned above.Sheltering of the population living nearest to the installation was carried out by the following municipalities: -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Les Franqueses de Vall&egrave;s (communities of Llerona and Corro del Val)-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L'Amettla del Vall&egrave;s-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sta Eu&agrave;lia de Ron&ccedil;ana-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conovelles-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Llica d'AmuntWe estimate the total population sheltering to be approximately 20,000 inhabitants.Together with the first fire warnings the emergency response services also received&nbsp; complaints from persons living in the neighbourhood of the plant concerning irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract.Ecological Harm-remarks:There were no consequences caused by the toxic effects of the cloud in the immediate vicinity of the plant because chlorine and other decomposition products forming the cloud were at high temperatures; consequences were reported only in areas at a distance of more than one kilometre, when the smoke cooled down and deposited.Material loss:The company had already scheduled to close down the plant approximately one month after the accident occurred. Another plant substituting the old one was already operative.The social cost of the accident has not been evaluated.","The population affected sheltered-in-place.On-site an attempt was made to control the fire with on-site extinguishing equipment, the on-site emergency plan was activated and external assistance was requested. The off-site Emergency plan was activated and the population sheltered-in-place as a protective measure. The product residues and the extinguishing water were disposed of according to the indications of the Catalunya waste agency.Emergency measures - Remarks: On request of the Catalunya Waste Agency the company collected the contaminated ground area, 25 m3, and sent it to an authorised company for disposal.Post accident evaluation; the off-site emergency plan did not consider the scenario of a fire with smoke containing a certain percentage of chlorine; scenarios of accidents caused by the release of chlorine and the formation of a toxic cloud were considered. These accident scenarios foresaw much more serious consequences than those of the actual accident which occurred. ","Measures to prevent recurrence:The Department for Industry of Catalunya, competent in this field, proposed a series of corrective measures, which will not be applied to this installation because, as planned, dismantling operations of the plant started end of July 2003. The issue of a series of general guidelines for installations producing or handling the same product or similar substances will be studied.The following conclusions were drawn from the accident:·&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The use of the transit area as a storage area appears to be negligent with regards to safety and was worsened by the following factors:-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Significant amounts (54 tons/day before the accident) of product stored in a small area practically exposed to atmospheric conditions.-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The product safety sheet indicates that exposing the product to humidity and temperatures above 40°C should be avoided-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Irregular storage duration: three months.-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lack of specific fire fighting equipment for the area.-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Design of the area, the cable racks were suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground but the piles of product reached a height of 3.5 meters.·&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Operative procedures and safety management system. Unsafe practices:-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Failure to recover the spilled product with the intention to postpone the operation to the next day.-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Leaving a fork lift truck near the big bags with the risk associated to the presence of fuel.-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There were no written procedures on the measures to be taken in case of the rupture of a bag and product spill, although it appears that the workers knew that they had to be careful during product recovery and that contaminated products had to be sent for disposal.·&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the workers bag ruptures were frequent. Moreover they all report&nbsp; having seen sodium dichlorisocyanurate react with trichlorocyanuric acid (TCCA) with fuel or water in the processing area. Consequently although risks were known the safety measures taken were not sufficiently effective.·&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The installation did not comply with the regulations set out by the current legislation according to the results of the inspections foreseen for Major Accident Hazard installations, although the non-compliance did not concern classified substances. Although the operator was still within the terms for the corrective measures set out following the inspection, but not all of them, it has to be said that this does not exempt the operator from the exclusive responsibility with regards to the non-compliance with the applicable regulations as from the date these regulations were implemented in Spanish law.Measures to mitigate consequences: The lack of an extinguishing water system independent of the process, although not obligatory, associated with the failure of the electric cable system led to the plant not being able to respond to the emergency&nbsp; with its own means, having&nbsp; to depend completely on external emergency response services and fire brigades.Alternative systems are being studied.Useful references:The medical services reported that no patients were treated for the effects of the toxic cloud but complaints concerning irritation to eyes and respiratory tract were received by local police officers of adjacent municipalities and by the emergency number 112. This leads us to suppose that the smoke cloud was at such a height not to affect the population of the rural area nearest to the plant, in which there are farm buildings. When the smoke cooled down and reached the ground it was sufficiently diluted not to cause any severe health consequences to people.The fact that the population living in the vicinity was alerted and requested to take shelter in their homes and to close doors and windows certainly contributed to reducing the consequences of this event."

The personnel distributed 50 kg of potassium permanganate dust on the tank bottom and transferred by gravity approximately 13m3 of alcohol in the tank. The personnel left the storage facility after finishing this operation at about 16:35 hrs.At 16:42(t=0), the tank F10 containing 13 m3 of alcohol exploded projecting its roof&nbsp; more than 10 m up in the air. The tank-roof fell on the roof of tank F8 with a capacity of 1500 m3 (empty when the accident occurred). The retention basin of the two tanks, called basin B, and tank F10 were on fire.At 16:52 (t= +10 min) explosion of the empty tank MG11 with a capacity of 540 m3 occurred. The roof was projected some 30 m away onto a nearby limestone pile . The safety managers of the distillery were alerted by the first explosions and activated the fixed fire-fighting means from the extinguishing system pump house - the fire monitor of the alcohol storage installation was set to foam position,- the spray rings on top of the adjacent silos were activated in water position - the spray rings on top of the tanks of the alcohol storage installation could be set on demand to either water or&nbsp; foam, this operation could be performed from the distribution stations located near the tanksOn request of the Classified Installation Inspectorate (DRIRE), the company requested the French National Institute of Industrial Environment and Risks (INERIS) to investigate the accident causes. The results of the investigation found that the explosion of Tank F10 was caused by the ignition of an explosive atmosphere (ATEX - ATmosphère EXplosive) consisting of a mixture of alcohol vapours and air which had formed under the tank roof.The ignition was caused by a strongly exothermic reaction of an excess&nbsp; amount of potassium permanganate (KMNO4) reacting with a 96% hydro-alcoholic solution of ethanol. The domino effect increased the consequences of the accident damaging other tanks.The&nbsp; report is based specifically on the results of a laboratory test which showed that a heterogeneous mixture of KMNO4 and ethanol in the proportions present in the tank causes an exothermic reaction capable of igniting an explosive atmosphere above the surface formed by ethanol/air. Mixing permanganate with ethanol was a procedure, which had been adopted since the storage installation was put into service in 1980 without causing any significant incident, in order to reduce the content of sulphur compounds in the alcohol.","Loss of production damage is estimated at 2.13 m euros, material damage is estimated at 2m euros (2.000.000 euros): 2 tanks were completely destroyed - 15000 m3 tank the structure collapsed;- 540 m3 tank - (roof projected)- the roofs of three (3) 115 m3 tanks were ripped open.The company will treat 2000 m3 of extinguishing water.","At 17:00 h the Onsite Emergency Plan was releasedAt 17:15 h 120 employees and 90 fire fighters were mobilised, emulsifiers (some proved to be incompatible with alcohol) were provided also by neighbouring industries.At 17:38 h spray rings and a water monitor were used to protect nearby installations. At 17:42 h the fire was extinguishedAt 18:55 h spraying was interruptedAt 19:30 h the On-site Emergency Plan was called off","The installation was compliant with the provisions defined in the ministerial technical guidelines of 9th November 1989; the provisions were implemented in 1994 and concerned the protection systems (fire extinguishing system, fixed water/foam monitor, emulsifier reserve) this allowed a rapid response of the factory personnel while the external emergency services&nbsp; were arriving-An on-site Emergency Response Exercise performed in June of the same year based on&nbsp; a similar accident scenario allowed the personnel to react in the correct way to the crisis situation.The question arises about what would have happened if the personnel had been absent from the site, a situation which actually occurs between two sugar production seasons.The emulsifiers supplied by nearby industries proved to be incompatible with polarised flammable liquids (alcohol) and could not be used on the premises of the sugar factory.The communication system with the fire brigade failed, as it had done during the emergency response exercise of 28th June 2001."
20,830,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Release and small flash fire of a isobutane leak with HF traces occurred in a HF alkylation unit,1990-12-11 12:00:00,1990-12-11 00:00:00,"ENVIRONMENT AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Gentle wind (2 metres/sec) from South East under ""F"" stability class.At 12:18 hr an isobutane leak with hydrogen fluoride traces occurred in the HF alkylation unit. It occurred when one of the two small bore pipe tappings into a large 10"" (250mm) pipeline underwent fatigue fracture owing to vibrations. This tapping was used to allow process stream into a flow transmitter. The initial leak rate (at the operating pressure of about 16 barg) was about 11.8 tonnes/h. Shortly after the first failure, the second tapping nipple fractured and the total release rate became 23.6 tonnes/h. The gas did not immediately ignite and the leak was quickly identified both by plant instrumentation and visually. The activation of remotely operated valves allowed the&nbsp; isolation of the process piping and the diversion of the contents of the isolated section to a flare within 2 minutes. The escaped gas cloud ignited probably on a diesel engined painters mobile hoist after a few minutes, resulting in a small flash fire. The isolation and venting was so successful that the accident was over in 25 minutes with the fire extinguished.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:Owing to vibrations, a 1/2"" (12mm) scheduled 160 nipple in flange orifice screwed tapping fatigue fractured. The fitting was new (only 11 hours in service). The isobutane leak occurred at approximately 16 barg. The escaped gas cloud, probably ignited on a diesel engined painters mobile hoist that was operating nearby, resulted in a small flash fire.CAUSES:The accident was caused by the fatigue fracture (due to vibrations and, probably, to an inadequate component design) of a 1/2"" scheduled 160 nipple in flange orifice screwed tapping.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:3 people were injured by the accident: one from the shock, one from inhalation of isobutane and the third with burns caused by the flash fire. All were taken to hospital in a precautionary way but only the operator with burns was detained overnight.MATERIAL LOSS:Pipework lagging, electric cables scaffold boards were damaged during the accident but no data are available about the cost of the material losses.Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Full site emergency alert. The internal emergency teams put into operation the water monitor sprays during vapour dispersion and after the ignition. Cooling was applied to the nearby plant vessels in order to prevent B.L.E.V.E. The activation of remotely operated valves allowed the isolation of the process piping and the diversion of the contents of the isolated section to a flare.&nbsp;EXTERNAL SERVICES:The external county emergency services were called but the accident was over and fire extinguished before they could deploy their equipment.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
After the accident, the following measures were established:1- replacement of the flow metering device with a non-intrusive one;2- review of the use of mobile diesel-powdered plants in the area of process units with the purpose of reducing its use;3- extensive vibrations monitoring to identify any equipment causing excessive vibrations;4- full survey of pipework supports on plant."

The diesel fuel was leaking from the tank bottom and spreading in the bund. The rate of the leak was 2 m³/h. The diesel fuel was transferred to another storage tank. The pumping and drainage of the tank were completed 2&nbsp;days later.","A 2.5&nbsp;m long fissure was discovered in the welding between the tank shell and the tank bottom. The tank bottom comprises an annular plate ring that supports the tank wall and onto which the base plates are welded. An expert inspection of the tank bottom revealed numerous problems:

in places, the annular plate ring was less than 50% as thick as it had originally been;
there was significant loss of thickness in the base plates;
localised subsidence of the tank.

The last ten-year inspection of the tank was in 2009 during which the tank was found to have subsided by 280&nbsp;mm. At that time the operator had a ring of concrete poured around the tank. In addition, external corrosion with significant loss of thickness was found in the base plates. The part of the annular ring plate close to the fissure had not been inspected due to a lack of equipment suited to its geometry.","The emergency services collected 22&nbsp;m&sup3; of diesel fuel, 26&nbsp;tonnes of polluted soil and 6&nbsp;tonnes of liquid waste for incineration in specialised facilities.",The diesel fuel was transferred to another storage tank. A hole was dug and lined in the bund so as to allow the diesel fuel to accumulate. A pumping system was then deployed to collect the liquid. The fire brigade attended the scene. The pumping and drainage of the tank were completed 2&nbsp;days later.,"After the incident, the operator undertook to:

replace the entire annular plate ring before putting the tank back into service;
fit patches to repair the base plates in the areas where the loss of thickness exceeded 40%;
check the thickness of the welding between the tank shell and the annular plate ring during each ten-year inspection.

crystalline residue precipitated during an adiabatic diazotization.
The personnel considered this residue to be an impurity of the
furnished amine, which would have to be removed by clarification before
coupling. Therefore, according to the process a suspension was conveyed
over a clarification press to the coupling kettle. Since the press was
full, the content (about 50%) was transferred into a vat. The remaining
50% was filtered at the beginning of the morning shift, and remained in
the clarification press.
During the morning shift, superiors found that the precipitate was not
the expected residue of the amine, containing sulphur, but a large
quantity of the diazo. Therefore, immediately instructions were issued
to wash the coupling kettle and the clarification press with water, and
to soak with water the transferred residue. During the inspection of
the clarification press in the morning, about 2 kg of the material fell
to the ground.
Since dry diazonium salts decompose immediately in case of mechanical
blows or friction, it must be assumed that a part of the residue
decomposed because of mechanical stress, which caused as a consequence
the explosion of the main part of the residue in the tub.","The event caused material damage for 2500000 to 3000000 EURO (two and a half million to three million EURO).
This event caused one fatality, and six persons were injured. Additionally, five persons suffered a temporary shock.&nbsp;","After this explosion, local alarm was immediately given and the building was evacuated. The on-site fire fighting team was alerted and other buildings in the neighbourhood were evacuated.","Revision of similar and corresponding diazotization processes involving clarification by filtration or containing isolated solid substances.
Consequent to the results of the investigation, clarification filtration of the diazonium salt and similar processes will be eliminated.
All process documentation related to the production of azo compounds was examined by a team of experts, who carried out a new hazard analysis based on the documentation.
The periodical training sessions of the collaborators shall be further improved thematically and didactically.
This event should be considered as a warning against the risks involved in the handling of diazonium salt solutions. The explosion risk arising from crystallisation must be particularly emphasised."

There was no ignition of the crude oil released. There were no injuries.
The Crude was preheated to 110'C and the pressure in the main line was 8 Bar.
The&nbsp;14” diameter by-pass line was fitted with a single isolation valve which was closed in normal use – it is only opened as part of start-up and shut-down activities for flushing at turnaround. This means that in normal use this de-salter by-pass line is a dead-leg. This deadleg already had 2 temporary repairs (clamps). The leak occurred at one end of&nbsp;one of these mechanical clamp repairs.&nbsp;","Pipework&nbsp;at&nbsp;site &nbsp;has been in service for more than 50 years. The loss occured at the edge of a mechanical repair clamp on a By-pass line (deadleg) on the De-salter. The leak occured through a hole about 20mm diameter (but that this was ~60% obstructed by the clamp so hole ~12.8mm).
The Loss of Containment (LOC) was caused by internal corrosion of the pipe.&nbsp;
The Bypass line (deadleg)&nbsp;could not be isolated and the leak continued for 8 hours. Primary isolation of the leak took 3 hours. There were no automated valve or remotely operated shut off valves (ROSOVs) available on the crude oil pipelines.","Estimated loss of 20m3 of crude oil&nbsp;confined to&nbsp;local area of leak.

29,1013,Near Miss,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Bursting of a high-pressure steam pipe,2010-06-28 23:15:00,2010-06-29 01:50:00,"At 11:15 pm, a violent and loud bursting occurs within an ammonia (NH3) synthesis unit at a SEVESO-classified nitrogenous fertiliser plant. The convex base welded to a heat-insulated, high-pressure water vapour pipe connected to catalytic reforming equipment had burst prior to ignition. The base, a 40-kg block of steel, was projected longitudinally. Inside the shop area, a walkway was ripped off its supports damaging an access ladder. The steel base crossed the ammonia confinement space 25 m further, without causing any damage, then flew over an ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land 230 m away in a parking zone for tanker cars full of ammonia awaiting shipment, which on that day happened to be empty. The water vapour, circulated at 520°C under 120 bar of pressure in the pipeline, tore apart the asbestos cement cladding on the wall located 20 m from the original rupture and escaped into the atmosphere with a load accompanying noise. The two employees present in the unit at the time cut off vapour supply to stop the sound, shut down production operations and cooled the steam reformer with nitrogen. At 11:50 pm, the plant's internal emergency plan was activated by the operator, yet he failed to sound the siren or notify neighbouring localities. Alerted by the outside noise, local residents called emergency services around midnight; first responders arrived onsite with a crew of 55 men and several utility vehicles. No intervention was required on their part. Upon hearing the vehicle sirens, some residents stepped out onto their balconies or made their way to the periphery of the plant since the municipality was unable to provide information about the ongoing incident. No victims were reported and the site's other units were not adversely affected; no operations had to be interrupted. The damaged unit was shut down for several weeks, which in turn caused shutdowns at special fertiliser production units due to the loss of vapour.","A metallurgical assessment of the base indicated that slow creep had initiated on the outer skin, which combined with flow into the material layer was the cause of pipe rupture. This hypothesis relied on the detection of oxidised, yet non-deformed, pipe openings in the presence of intergranular microcracks on both the pipe and its base. The origin of this creep was explained by the metallurgical composition of the base, i.e. ordinary carbon steel containing no alloys and not adapted to temperatures above 425°C. The pipeline was made of a slightly-alloyed P22 type steel, which was more resistant to creep and compliant with the original specifications defined 32 years prior for both material elements. Inspections carried out at the time on the convex base did not detect any noncompliance of the steel, given that non-destructive technology had not yet come of age. This creep might have been accelerated as a result of heat treatment performed at 700°C during equipment installation, once the assembly had been welded. Periodic inspections dedicated to pressurised equipment on the damaged pipe were only recorded into the log 25 years after service start-up, at the time of applying for facility recertification. The initial recertification was rendered official without any underlying structural documentation (misplaced), and subsequent inspections never focused on the section of pipe that would burst.Nine months before the accident, the in-house inspection team had requested adding the mode of ""degradation by high-pressure vapour pipe vibrations"" to the unit's pipe inspection routine, following a break in the drain valve of a high-pressure pipe when restarting operations at the unit. On the day of the accident, this mode had not been included in the inspection programme. Classified Facilities inspectors requested a materials control of all unit pipes before restarting operations; this additional step revealed 12 other noncompliant steel components (a tee junction, tap, base, flange, etc.).","The base, a 40-kg block of steel, was projected longitudinally. Inside the shop area, a walkway was ripped off its supports damaging an access ladder. The steel base crossed the ammonia confinement space 25 m further, without causing any damage, then flew over an ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land 230 m away in a parking zone for tanker cars full of ammonia awaiting shipment, which on that day happened to be empty. The water vapour, circulated at 520&deg;C under 120 bar of pressure in the pipeline, tore apart the asbestos cement cladding on the wall located 20 m from the original rupture and escaped into the atmosphere with a load accompanying noise.","The two employees present in the unit at the time cut off vapour supply to stop the sound, shut down production operations and cooled the steam reformer with nitrogen.

Alerted by the outside noise, local residents called emergency services around midnight; first responders arrived onsite with a crew of 55 men and several utility vehicles. No intervention was required on their part.","---Lessons Learned drawn from the FD_38831_Le Grand Quevilly_DP_vfin_GB.pdf report ----Even though the severity of this accident remained rather mild given the absence of domino effects, several lessons can still be drawn, relative to both the causes and circumstances.As for causes, this accident highlights two significant organisational flaws :• Deficiency in the control of equipments materials at the time of unit installation. Even though material certificates were verified by an independent control body according to the operator, the steel used on the bottom and 12 other pieces of equipment was not compliant with specifications, and the original pipe construction documentation could never be found.• Incomplete traceability of pipe monitoring given that until 2003, formalisation of the steam pipe condition monitoring protocol had only been partial (restricted to unit drawings). Formalisation of monitoring procedures was not initiated before the first periodic recertification, in application of the 15 March 2000 decree, though the unit had already been operating for 25 years. Nonetheless, the French regulation relative to plant pipelines (issued on 23rd January, 1962) stipulated in Article 13 that ""the documents, drawings or diagrams, testing and retesting reports, notes from inspections prescribed in Article 12, relative to a pipeline or set of pipelines, are to be archived…"".From a broader perspective, this accident stresses the difficulties found by the internal and external control entities in detecting such non-compliance in steel. As demonstrated in the inventory of all unit’s pipes, this non-compliance does not represent an isolated case. It would be useful to mention that a verification of the steel quality had taken place in 1987 but was limited to those elements prone to hot hydrogen damages. Even if the initial recertification had been conducted in compliance with current regulations (without any imposed hydraulic test, no imposed exposure, original drawings forwarded to the authorised certification body), the question can still be raised whether it was reasonable to limit this verification to just the regulatory control steps in the absence of construction specifications. The organisation of these controls, shared over time among several distinct actors (internal inspection team, certified control authorities and the various external firms subcontracted to perform specific tasks), was not designed to promote efficient monitoring given the lack of rigour in their formalisation.The operator also conducted verifications on the type of materials found on the most sensitive parts of the site's other units. The local environmental authority requested an operator of similar units located just a few kilometres away to undertake the same kind of verification. Feedback was addressed at the national level to all local environmental authority offices.As regards the consequences of this accident, it can be considered that a 40-kg steel projectile propelled through an operating ammonia production unit, passing close to an NH3 receiving bottle, missing the nitric acid unit and a bulk ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land in a zone where railcars loaded with ammonia were likely to park, all while causing relatively minor property damage, lies within the realm of “divine intervention”. This assessment was underscored in a letter written by the local environmental authority to the operator: ""… the caps, which are massive pieces of equipment weighing some forty kilograms, most likely crossed the most sensitive installations found in the AM2 unit, namely the R1501 bottle, to ultimately land between 2 railway lines at the location of switch 371. These elements attest to the potential seriousness of this incident…"".This potential seriousness was also fully perceived by the operator, with some testimonials suggesting that some plant employees became aware of the risks related to pressurised steam. It goes without saying that the site's safety reports were focused on the most common hazardous phenomena for this kind of activity, as well as those causing potential effects outside the site boundaries, though domino effects caused by pressurised steam equipments were not included.The scenario with most third-party exposure is based on a toxic ammonia leak (up to an 8-km radius around the site).This scenario recently became more predominant in employees mind given the repetition of accidents of this type arising just a short time earlier at one of the Group's sister facilities located less than 200 km from Grand Quevilly (three months before the accident : ARIA 38959; and one year before with the evacuation of 300 employees receiving significant media attention : ARIA 36660).Besides, a flaw in the implementation of instructions issued by the internal inspection team has to be pointed out.Following the incident that occurred in October 2009, when the water hammer associated with a restart had caused the rupture of a bleed valve on one of the unit's high-pressure pipes, this team had requested that the pipe inspection plan incorporate the mode of vibration-induced degradation. Eight months later, on the day of the accident, this mode had still not been included even though it would have perhaps allowed to detect the surface defect or the onset of microcracking at the level of the weld (had for example a magnafluxing inspection been carried out on the suspected weld).On the other hand and despite the communication efforts engaged by the site operator and authorities over major accidents behaviour in the past few years, this potentially serious outcome has gone unnoticed by all neighbours. Several local residents actually went onto their balconies to observe the actions of fire-fighters, while others walked up to the site boundary even though safety guidelines called for residents to remain indoors.In defence of local residents, the operator's decision to activate the internal emergency plan would have alerted them to the potential seriousness of the incident. Instead, the operator waited for 50 minutes before triggering this emergency plan jointly with the municipality and local authorities. Fire-fighters were notified well before this period, but this notification came from local residents calls, and fire-fighting crews were unaware of the exact situation when they arrived at 11:30 pm in front of the site. Moreover, the decision made at 11:15 pm not to activate the emergency siren on the grounds of an absence of toxic leaks only further sparked the curiosity of some residents upon hearing the leaking steam noise between 11:07 and 11:27 pm, inciting them to get closer to the site. In reality, the operator could not have been completely certain of the absence of toxic leaks until around 12:18 am, after the second inspection of the damaged unit and negative controls of air toxicity around the site. A final inspection of the unit with authority representatives was even considered necessary at 1:15 am to remove any lingering doubts.Alerting local residents and requesting them to remain indoors, even if not really necessary, would have provided the added benefit of reminding residents that a major accident can occur and would have tested their ability to apply correctly the preventive guidelines.In conclusion, the operator was late in informing local emergency response teams and neighbouring municipalities, which were unable to notify individuals with information regarding the accident, a shortcoming that further incited the inappropriate reaction of some residents. And yet the plant's locality happened to be one of the few in France to be equipped with an automated call system to quickly and simultaneously alert residents living near the site."

The day of the event, 12 tons of process water effluents from a receiver were transferred into a mixing vessel and treated with 150 kg of solid iron chloride (FeCl3) in sulphuric acid (60%), setting pH 2.5-3.0. The pH was controlled by taking a sample with a manual sampler and tested with a portable pH testing equipment externally to the vessel.After the third test, the pH was at 2.9, corresponding to default parameters. The operator in charge decided to perform a last test after a short stirring time, in order to guarantee a stable pH value.According to the analysis of the damage, an explosion occurred in the gas space of the mixing vessel (the presence of a highly flammable liquid in the mixing vessel must have formed an explosive vapour-air mixture in the gas space of the vessel). The operator in charge, standing in front of the opened manhole, was fatally injured by the explosion.Hydrogen peroxide 35%, which according to operating instructions had to be fed in after setting the pH value, had still not been added due to the fact that the manual pH test had not been concluded.The meeting in time and space of a ignitable explosive atmosphere with an ignition source has to be traced back to a deviance in the operating conditions and was not to be expected in that form.","The operator in charge, standing in front of the opened manhole, was fatally injured by the explosion.

The operator had to shut-down the H2S processing unit and the production of phenate in order to enter into the processing equipment and clean them completely. During this shutdown phase the vents of the reactors were directed towards a flare. The cleaning of the processing equipment led to the release of 110 t of SO2 and to the production of 50 t of polluted water to be treated. It was estimated that repair works  would take approximately 20 days.
",The accident consists in the release of the substances that are part of the process: partial combustion of H2S in SO2 and discharge of this over the equipment used in the process and discharge of fluids consisting in an overcharge of liquid effluents.,The air pollution event and the overcharge of liquid effluents were caused by the cleaning operations consequent to the clogging of the processing equipment by sulphur.

He alerted immediately the onsite fire brigade. The fire brigade intervened and sprayed the room with water.

38,1192,Major Accident,"General engineering, manufacturing and assembly",Fire in a rolling bearing manufacturing plant,2019-10-22 13:20:00,2019-10-22 18:00:00,"According to fire investigation reports, the fire was triggered by sparks in a grinding machine. The incandescent sparks entered an exhaust air duct and ignited the combustible residue there. As a result of the suction effect, the fire eventually extended to a collecting duct in the basement and to a machine exhaust duct.
In total, within the operational area, five people had to be treated for poisoning (ambulatory care), while one additional person was hospitalised.Outside the operational area, no damage to property or personal injury occurred, nor were any evacuation measures necessary.
Safety measures:The alarm was raised by the CO2 extinguishing system’s fire alarm centre and by smoke detectors, manual alarms and a fire alert made by telephone to the security office. At around 13:20, the security office informed the emergency services.Evacuation measures were taken to move the workers at the plant to the relevant assembly stations.The fire was extinguished by emergency services using CO2.Water was used as a secondary measure. Environmental damage is not expected in relation to this incident.","Sparks are immediately extinguished by the continuous addition of a cooling lubricant in the form of an aqueous emulsion.In the case of the fire in question, the emulsion input was temporarily interrupted. The suspected reason for this was air bubbles in the pipe.","Smoke and fire damage | material damage amounting to EUR&nbsp;2,000,000.Six employees injured. Five people had to be treated for poisoning (ambulatory care), while one additional person was hospitalised.","Staff evacuated, power supply shut off, scene of incident cordoned off.Cleaning and replacement of manufacturing and supply systems.","
The cleaning interval for the machine outlet system will be shortened. Up to now, the system has been cleaned annually.
The machine outlet plan will be optimised.

Recommendations from the authority:

Ensure that combustible residues in the exhaust systems are regularly removed by cleaning or are prevented by technical means from entering.
Examine technical options for optimising emulsion input, and implement as appropriate.
Create and label openings for the injection of extinguishing agents into the exhaust systems.
Review and, if necessary, update firefighting plans in accordance with DIN (German Institute for Standardisation) requirements.
Keep multiple copies of the firefighting plans on site.
Carry out regular exercises with external emergency services (in particular with the on-site fire brigade and the municipal fire brigade) to familiarise them with the location.
Ensure that sufficient master keys are available at all times for external fire brigades.
Install an early fire detection system and an extinguishing system in the exhaust systems.
Draw up an information sheet on the possible adverse effects/consequences of shutting down the energy supply to parts of the plant affected by an accident. This should be made accessible to external emergency services/fire brigades, as well as being kept on site.

An extensive sprinkler system will be installed in the manufacturing areas."
39,833,Major Accident,"Power generation, supply and distribution ",Release of natural gas during the filling of a lift spirally guided water sealed gas holder,1990-12-22 01:00:00,1990-12-22 00:00:00,"Grid control had taken gas out of the holder on December 21 and were aware that it required filling to satisfy the next days demands. The recorded stock level when filling commenced at 23:30 was 967,300 ft3. The filling rate was about 450,000 ft3/hr (max permissible fill rate 700,000 ft3/hr on volumetric governor). At 02:45 the holder station depot phoned grid to advise them of the leak. The volumetric governor was immediately shut-down by Grid control and the booster operated. Natural gas dispersed safely without igniting. The holder was emptied and filled without apparent problems four times during the five days preceding the accident (on December 16, 18, 19 and 20). The holder water cup levels were checked on a weekly basis and no abnormal readings were found prior to the release.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
During a normal remote filling operation of a gas holder, a welding failure resulted in the loss of water seal and, consequently, the escape of about 38,100 kg of natural gas. The gas dispersed without igniting.   
                                                                                          
CAUSES:
The accident occurred because of a welding failure. A cup channel was wasted along weld in section between the dip plate and the cup skirting plate. The wasting was local to rest block and weld. As consequence, water from the dip cup was lost and, consequently, natural gas escaped (a diagram is attached to the Original Report to show the position of the leak found in the inner lift cup). When the Original Report was prepared the causes for wasting were unknown. However, this was not considered to be due to excessive or cyclic pressure being exerted on the rest block during operation of the holder. Besides, an insufficient supervision delayed the isolation of the gas holder, allowing the release of natural gas for about one hour and forty five minutes after the first alert.","OTHER:No material losses occurred except the escaped natural gas.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA:The location of the Gas Service Centre and of the point of the reported ""gas escapes"" are shown on a map attached to the Original Report. More detailed information on gas concentrations is not available.People - Remarks: No people were injured during the accident.Disruption of community life: The natural gas escape was reported by members of the public that detected a smell of gas up to 1 km far from the gas service station.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The grid control (the remote operation centre) shut-down the gas inlet to the holder and started the town booster to allow the gas outlet from the holder.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:No measures were deemed necessary by company as natural gas dispersed safely without igniting. No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the examination of further 36 rest blocks has been undertaken and modifications/repairs have been carried out if deemed necessary. The causes of the failure have been brought to the attention of other areas of operating companies to enable inspection requirements to be considered for further holders."
40,200,Near Miss,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion and substance release at an organic chemical company,2014-09-11 09:10:00,2014-09-11 00:00:00,"On 11&nbsp;September 2014 an exothermic chemical reaction at an organic chemical company got out of control, leading to the loss of the container contents and considerable damage to the plant. The exact circumstances and causes of the incident are still being investigated.&nbsp;
The details of what triggered the incident are still not known.The temperature in the reactor increased. A member of staff attempted to stop the temperature increase by exchanging the cooling water for brine. On observing rapid gas development, he partially closed the steam shut-off valve, which had been completely open, in order to prevent a pressure surge in the connected glass apparatus.On the controls immediately adjacent to the reactor, reactor pressure was at 6&nbsp;bar (and climbing) and a temperature of 123&nbsp;°C was displayed.
Situation so far:Subsequently, a pressure surge must have occurred that was so strong that the seal between the dome cover and the base of the reaction vessel was forced out and partially destroyed. This sprayed the largely gaseous reaction mixture into the production room on the floor above, despite the safety devices having activated (the blowdown container caught around 40&nbsp;kg of the mixture).The glass safety valve in the water vapour pipe (0.3&nbsp;bar) most likely also activated, but a glass bend in the supply pipe nonetheless burst, releasing more of the product into the work area.
A week previously, the same reaction had been carried out without incident. The heat development was familiar and the gas development was as expected (recognised by very slight foaming close to the stirrer vortex). This was the same as in the laboratory tests carried out.
The safety valve and the rupture disc to protect the container (6&nbsp;bar) activated, leading to around 40&nbsp;kg of product being released into the blowdown container.","From the reconstruction of the incident and the situation analysis, the reactor’s thermal runaway as a result of the degradation of performic acid was identified as the probable cause of the explosion.&nbsp;
In addition, the investigations into the cause showed that a number of circumstances had contributed to the incident. Among other things, the following deficiencies were identified:– missing chemical kinetic data for the planned reaction;– lack of knowledge of the heating and cooling capacity of the reactors;– no systematic risk analysis or considerations regarding scaling-up;– insufficient cooling capacity owing to a partial malfunction of the cooling system;– selection of an unsuitable reactor to carry out the reaction in question;– considerable deficiencies in SMS and operational organisation.
The multiple changes of operator and the transition from being part of a large group with central safety operations to being a contract manufacturer no doubt contributed to the insufficient capacity of the SMS.
Unexpected temperature and pressure development.","Damage to glass-lined reactor and the MSR installation and surroundings, and damage to the floor covering.
Closure of a street for around one hour.","Immediate evacuation of the site, activation of ‘fire alarm’, assembly at assembly point.
Inside the building:Following clearance from the fire service, the area was inspected. At that point, the lighting and stirrer in the reactor were still operating.In conjunction, preliminary cleaning of the production area was carried out in order to avoid further corrosion damage. The cleaning water was collected. Further cleaning took place after a risk assessment and corrective action.After checks on the electrical installation, equipment was turned off in order to guarantee safety. They could only be put into operation again after parts had been repaired or replaced and tested.&nbsp;
– Initial cleaning of the affected area with water by the fire service;– The waste water was pumped by operating staff from the collection area into an emergency tank;– Cleaning and testing of equipment in the affected area;
– Cordoning off of the site;– Setting up a decontamination bath;– Measurements in the surroundings;
Evacuation of the site using announcements and the fire alarm, which had activated.Roll-call against presence list.
The fire service decontaminated the area around the boiler and significant puddles with a light jet. The rest of the clean-up was carried out internally. The flushing fluids were collected and disposed of by the company.
Repairs to the damaged reactor and the floor, including replacing anti-corrosion treatments.Replacement of the boiler control display and other damaged electronic components.","As a result of the investigation, additional protective measures are regarded as reasonable and recommended in order to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the future.

41,632,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Explosion of gasoline vapors during the construction of two adjacent tanks,2003-08-29 15:35:00,2003-08-29 19:20:00,"Construction was carried out at two adjacent tanks. One was involved in hot work. At the other tank, a manhole at the tank side was opened, and gasoline was drawn off. A fire occurred at this time. Six workers at both tanks were killed, and one person was injured. The gasoline vapor generated seemed to ignite during hot work. One mounted gas detector sounded, but it was too late. The cause of the accident seemed to be a construction management error.","Immediate cause: The gasoline vapor generated near No.2 tank circulated around the tank's circumference, and the gas was ignited by a fire source during construction of No.24 tank.
Underlying cause: The underlying cause was clearly a management system error. Draw-off work for light hydrocarbons at an adjacent tank was carried out with the manhole open. At the same time, hot work was carried out with a gas detector set up near an adjacent tank. There is a lack of risk management based on the prediction of the generation of gasoline vapor from gasoline draw-off work at an adjacent tank, or the generation of combustible gas from venting gas from another tank and drainage work, etc. There might have been a lack consciousness of the hazard and an insufficient grasp of the details of construction.","Six workers at both tanks were killed, and one person was injured.",The public fire brigade turned out and the fire was extinguished.,"1. It is natural when light hydrocarbons such as gasoline are released into the atmosphere, combustible vapor is generated. This vapor spreads. At the opposite side of the manhole of the tank, the vapor also spreads. This is a basic point to be understood in handling a liquid with a low ignition point such as gasoline. 
2. Safety countermeasures for the construction of hazardous facilities are primarily the responsibility of the owner. Even if the subcontractor is knowledgeable, the owner must have superior knowledge of hazardous substances and the situation in the facilities."

Cause/sequence of events: the fire broke out on the second floor of the southern part of the concrete 4-storey production building, where textiles were produced, and extensively destroyed the second and third floors as well as the flat roof and the installations assembled there. The whole building was divided into several fire compartments. This safety measure, combined with the prompt action of the plant fire brigade, prevented the fire from spreading beyond the southern part of the building. The fire was discovered whilst a textile dye was being produced during the night shift in the vicinity of filter presses 3 and 4, which were both installed in one room on the second floor. According to a member of staff who was involved in and supervising production of the dye, the manufactured raw product was being pressed/washed with dimethylacetamide solvent (DMCA) in filter press 4 when he noticed naked flames coming from the filter press area. As filter press 3 was not in use, there is probably a link between the fire and the use of filter press 4. An explosion or a bang, which would indicate an explosive reaction or a deflagration, was not heard. Furthermore, it was asserted that one of the two fluorescent lamps fitted above filter press 4 was faulty and was no longer lit. Description of incident: On 01/09/2003 at around 10.00 pm a major fire broke out in a textile dye factory. Max. two barrels containing approx. 3 cubic metres of indanthrene dyes and solvents at most were burnt. Measurements conducted by the plant's environmental monitoring car and the professional fire brigade showed harmless concentrations of fumes in the surrounding area. The plant and neighbouring plants were evacuated immediately. The public authorities were informed. The police and local radio stations advised the public in the areas affected to shut their windows and doors. There were no personal injuries",It was not possible to determine the exact cause of the fire. Possible sources of ignition in the area of filter press 4 are:1. Overheating of oil hydraulics motor2. Hydraulic oil dispersed through leaky screw connection.3. Faulty explosion-proof lamp in booth (one light was not working).4. Source of ignition drawn in via exhaust pipe from northern part of building.5. Dimethylacetamide sprayed from a leaky flange.,not given,"Safety functions:
The part of the plant affected was immediately shut off.

The leak was the result of a hole approximately 10&nbsp;cm in diameter on a connection pipe between a heat exchanger and a downstream low-temperature separator, at a height of approximately 10&nbsp;m.This resulted in a fall in pressure in the affected part of the facility, with an increase in noise, the activation of gas sensors in the vicinity and the deployment of the on-site fire service. The incident led to material damage, pollution of the surroundings and a production outage, but no injuries.– Shutdown of the equipment using a shutdown and pressure relief system;– Evacuation of that area of the facility;– Safety operation by the on-site fire service;– Activation of the emergency response plan;– Transmission of a D2 notification to the regional control room;– Information to neighbouring businesses via a digital alarm and communication server (DACS), and information to local residents.","Deterioration of wall thickness downstream of a bend in a pipe through a process of erosion/corrosion (ammonium bisulphide erosion-corrosion in the aqueous phase).Parameters influencing this phenomenon are:– concentration of ammonium bisulphide;– speed of the medium and flow regime;– partial pressure of hydrogen sulphide, the presence of flowing water and the metallurgy of the pipes.&nbsp;
The root cause analysis established that the deterioration of the wall thickness that preceded the incident was not detected by the existing inspection programme (on-stream inspection – OSI).The two-phase mixture flows at high speed through the system of pipes and strips more material at points where the flow is diverted than in straight areas within the pipes.
In accordance with the risk-based procedure applied by the operator, the inspection programme has therefore concentrated on these points, especially on the bends in the pipes.However, the present incident shows that the stripping processes within the pipes may be greatest at points where this is not expected based on engineering expertise and experience.In the present case, the deterioration of the wall thickness that led to the leak occurred approximately 20&nbsp;cm beyond a bend in the pipe.","Leak in pipe, damage to insulation.","– Shutdown of the equipment using a shutdown and pressure relief system;– Evacuation of that area of the facility;– Safety operation by the on-site fire service;– Activation of the emergency response plan;– Transmission of a D2 notification to the regional control room;– Information to neighbouring businesses via DACS and information to local residents.&nbsp;

After the part of the installation affected had been identified and isolated, it was decided to let the naphtha burn out under control, while nitrogen was used to push out the residual naphtha from the equipment.The cause of the event was probably linked to maintenance works on a cracking furnace.In order to clean out the coke deposited inside the cracking tubes as a consequence of the reaction mechanisms, the smaller cracking furnaces have to be shut-down every 60 days. The coke is then burnt into CO2 through controlled feeding of water vapour and air into the cracking tubes.Before this operation, the cracking tubes must be thoroughly flushed to remove any hydrocarbon residues, after which the cracking tubes must be safely separated from the naphtha system. To do this, besides shutting off the valves, blanking plates are placed in the inlets of the furnace.In the case being considered, this switch-over of furnaces was being carried out. The required work was carried out by a team. A blanking plate plan in the control room documents the extraction and the placing of blanking plates . In the beginning, the team correctly followed the sequence of procedures required by the operating instructions and the plan. However, it appears that the release occurred, a blanking plate from a nearby pressurised naphtha pipe was extracted instead of a blanking plate from the pipe leading to the furnace which had to be decoked. The released overheated liquid vaporised spontaneously and caught fire within a few seconds upon contact with an adjacent furnace.","Two persons were treated as out-patients, while two more were treated as in-patients in a hospital.
According to preliminary approximations, the repair costs amount to over 10.000.000 DM -5.000.000 Euro.

","The on-site emergency response team fought the fire and took measures to reduce the temperature of the not burning adjoining parts of the installation. After the concerned section had been identified and isolated, it was decided to let the naphtha burn away under control, while nitrogen was used to push out the residual naphtha from the equipment.","Spectacle blanking plates will be mounted instead of the fast-exchange blanking plates used in the context of the incident.
Moreover, manometers are going to be installed in evidence close to the blanking plates, providing a supplementary possibility for the personnel to check that the system is not under pressure."

48,1128,Near Miss,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Fire of a plastic pipe in an inorganic fluoride technical facility,2017-08-12 03:05:00,2017-08-12 03:45:00,"Fire of a plastic pipe transporting small quantities of elemental fluorine for flue gas cleaning. An exothermic reaction of the fluorine with the pipeline caused the pipe to ignite and burn up.
On 12 August 2017, at approximately 03:00, the gas warning sensor on the 12&nbsp;m stage of the inorganic fluoride training facility building triggered the alarm. Simultaneously, the safety chain of the fluorine cleaning process was activated and the compressors, and indeed the whole cleaning process, was shut down into safe mode.The technical facility contains fluorine (F2) cleaning at 0&nbsp;m (enclosed in a concrete building) and iodine pentafluoride (IF5) production (dispersed over four floors in the building).When checking the alarm/shutdown, an employee discovered that a polyethylene (PE) line coming from the concrete building housing the fluorine cleaning process was burning.The on-site fire brigade was then alerted and was able to extinguish the fire completely at around 03:45.The neighbourhood was not adversely affected, nor were any site staff injured. There was no external impact in terms of emissions, as the technical facility is a closed building.
There were no employees in the building at the time of the fire.Two size C tubes were used to extinguish the fire. The volume of fire-fighting water was therefore relatively low. This was neutralised via the factory’s waste water treatment plant.The burning pipes were permanently extinguished using CO2 extinguishers.
Electricity to the technical facility building was immediately shut off during the extinguishing process.The destruction by fire of the PE line (approx. 30&nbsp;m) also affected the flue air scrubber of the technical facility building and electrical ducts.
Safety measures:Alarm given by gas sensors and smoke detectors, followed by immediate emergency shutdown of the installation in safe mode, on-site fire brigade called.","Condensed hydrofluoric acid (HF) is collected in a 60 litre reservoir, with pressure increasing as it collects. HF is blown back to electrolysis 1-2 times daily using molecular nitrogen (N2).Before the HF is blown for electrolysis, the pressure in the container needs to be reduced. This is done by opening a valve in the direction of the technical facility (scrubber).This process takes about 30-60 minutes.
On 12 August 2017, this operation was carried out at around 02:00. The valve was opened approximately 80%. Elemental fluorine (F2) from the reservoir reaches flue gas cleaning via a PE pipe. Inside this pipe there was an exothermic reaction of the fluorine with the PE, which ignited.As the fire burned through the PE wall, the gas alarm was triggered.
Classification of cause:Faster depressuring (valve open 80% instead of the usual 50%) of the fluorine volume and a suspected defect in the pipe (lack of retardant or age-related cracking) led to the spontaneous ignition of the fluorine gas and thus to the fire in the HD-PE* piping.

51,617,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Release of LPG (no fire nor explosion) during the dismantling operations of asafety relief valves for test,2001-09-17 11:25:00,2001-10-17 15:00:00,"Release of LPG in gas phase from the connection pipe to one of two safety valves installed on storage tank no. 1 in the tank park. Each tank is equipped with a safety valve assembly made of two safety relief valves installed on a slide valve to allow the regular testing of the safety valve efficiency by excluding one of the two safety valves from the circuit, allowing the provisional dismantling of the safety valves one at a time.At about 11 am, after having turned the shaft of the slide valve in such a way as to exclude the valve which was to be dismantled, a maintenance worker started to unscrew the valve; at a certain point during the loosening of the connection the valve and the drainage pipe to which it was connected were projected into the air and the violent release of LPG in gas phase from the tank started.The release continued without any other associated occurrence until the off-site fire brigade reached the premises and interrupted the release by sealing the valve socket.According to the safety manger of the company approximately 12.5 tons of LPG were released during the occurrence: this amount is above the 5% threshold foreseen for the substance involved in column 3 of Annex I of the Seveso II Directive (200 t).","The installation was sealed off by the locally competent judicial authority and subsequently a technical investigation was carried out by the Vicenza fire brigade on the safety valve assembly involved in the accident. The investigation showed that the washer, the separating metal plate with the relative gaskets and the sealing bolt of the gasket were missing on this valve assembly. All the missing parts except the bolt were later found inside the tank when it was inspected after cleaning operations; it is likely that the bolt was thrown out into the air.According to the design, in normal working of the valve assembly the central position of the gasket connects the tank with both safety valves, whereas by changing the position of the gasket towards one of the safety valve connections that valve can be dismantled and serviced.&nbsp; In the specific case, the missing gasket prevented the closing of the connection with the safety relief valve, causing the release of LPG and the ejection of the safety relief valve which was being dismantled by the worker during the scheduled periodic calibration. It is therefore assumed that a defect occurred in the slide valve due to a defective tightening of the bolt holding the sealing gasket.The initiating cause of the accident was probably the sealing gasket in the slide valve of the safety valve assembly slipping out of its seat and preventing the sealing of the valve seat opening of the safety valve which was being dismantled.However, the worker who was present at the accident stated that the gas detection device of the slide valve, consisting in a vent-hole, did not indicate detection of the presence of gas, which would have prevented him, according to the safety procedures, from dismantling the safety valve. ","The accident caused damage to the safety devices of the tank and the loss of 12.5 tons of LPG. The tank was sealed off for a short period of time by the competent judicial authorities.No effects on man or the environmentMaterial Loss:The costs indicated refer to: the value of the product released, the loss caused by the shut down of the installation ordered by the judicial authority and the substitution of the safety devices: the emergency response operation of the fire brigade is not taken into account as it is free of charge.Consequences - Discussion:Nevertheless, it has to be considered that in the case of ignition a jet fire could have occurred. The estimated effects were calculated using mathematical models available on the market (SIGEM, STAR and ministerial decree of the Environment Ministry DMA 15.5.96), reaching in the worst-case values of 12 kw/m2 up to a radius of 15 m approx. (lethal threshold indicated in the relevant literature), with easily foreseeable consequences for the worker.Affected Area: installation","When the accident occurred the operator was dismantling the safety relief valve to be calibrated. When he noticed the release of LPG he immediately alerted the storage house manager who activated the procedures foreseen by the onsite emergency plan (securing the installation by activating the shut-off valves on the pipes and the tanks constituting the tank park and starting the transfer of the LPG from the leaking tank into another partially empty tank).After a call from the company and also from the neighbouring population, first the fire brigade of Bassano del Grappa and then the fire brigade of Vicenza intervened and stopped the leak by sealing the valve seat of the safety relief valve which had been ejected by means of a threaded blind plug.For safety reasons the traffic on the road passing near the establishment (express way SS248 Gasparona was closed) throughout the occurrence (from approximately 11:25 hrs to 15:00 hrs).Official action taken - legal action: Immediately after the accident the Attorney General of Bassano del Grappa ordered the sealing off of tank no. 1 and equipment involved in the accident. The competent judicial authorities started criminal proceedings which were concluded in June 2002.Official action taken - other official action: The Regional Technical Committee  (CTR ) discussed the technical report presented by the fire brigade commander of Vicenza taking note of the accident causes, which successively led the company to present a new safety report.Seveso II duties  - remarks: When the accident occurred a
complete safety management system had not been implemented. Only after
the accident was the Safety Management System completely implemented
and verified with an inspection in February 2002.","Immediate lessons: Considering the
results of the technical investigation performed by the fire brigade on
the safety valve assembly, the company decided to substitute the valve
assembly concerned in the accident and all the other similar valve
assemblies on the other 6 tanks.
The competent inspection authority (ISPESL) also imposed the
installation on the pipe connecting the valve assembly and the tank, of
an additional shut-off ball valve with a seal applied on the all-open
position.
This measure was agreed upon with the competent regional control
authority. Measures to prevent recurrence: All safety valve assemblies were substituted and between each assembly and tank an additional valve with seal was installed, as described before, in order to be able to shut-off possible accidental releases. Measures to mitigate consequences: As a containment measure for accidental releases the installation of a water barrier is foreseen around LPG tanks.Useful references: The study of the accident was presented at the 2002 Risk Evaluation and Management Conference (VCR 2002) held in Pisa, with the title ""Analisi di un incidente - Rilascio di GPL gas"" by the authors F.

53,566,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Accident the water-bath used for pre-heating barrels of raw materials for a pesticide plan,1992-01-16 11:40:00,1992-01-16 00:00:00,"ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Direction&nbsp; of&nbsp; wind: West. Atmospheric Stability Class: D. Wind speed = 2m/sec (data given by the company).The accident occurred between 11:40 and 11:50 a.m. at the upper level of the building at the pesticide plant, in the water-bath used for pre-heating barrels of raw materials. The pre-heating at 40ö50oC of the contents of the barrels was carried out by means of hot water, which in turn was directly heated by steam supplied by a steam coil (the coil diameter was 5 cm whilst the diameter of the holes of the coil was 0.5 cm). According to the standard operating procedures, the operator had to be always present in the installation and to control the temperature of the raw material. The temperature control had to be carried out by checking the water temperature by means of a hand thermometer and by switching-off the steam valve. The heating of the water was allowed for a period of 2ö2.5 hours as maximum, since long operating experience had shown that this period of time was sufficient to reach a raw material temperature of about 40oC. The day of the accident dimethoate (14 barrels each containing 124 Kg of material) and parathion-methyl (6 barrels each containing 260 Kg of material) had to be heated. Despite of the standard operating instructions, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve of the line heating up the water of the bath. Thus, the heating time of the water of the bath and the barrels was extended for at least one hour. As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels containing dimethoate. As a result of the explosion (probably due to the friction between the caps and the bodies of the barrels), a fire of dimethoate occurred with subsequent emission of NOx, SOx and mercaptans. The fire was then followed by the detonation of the caps in other six barrels containing dimethoate. In order to avoid pollution of sea water by fire fighting extinguishing water (because its flow rate was too high and the pump which had to send it to the main waste water treatment plsnt was not adequate), the overflow was trapped in a pool made out of gypsum and limestone. It is under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the wastewater treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or if it was partly released to the sea. The plant halted working on 16 of January and started again to work on March of the same year, after the replacement of the water-bath by a new one.&nbsp;It is under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the waste water treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or if it was partly released to the sea.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The overheating of the water-bath caused the detonation of the caps in three barrels (each containing 125 kg of dimethoate) and afterwards a fire. The fire was then followed by the detonation of the caps of other six barrels containing dimethoate.

CAUSES:
When the Original Report was prepared, the accident was under juridical investigation. At that moment, the current analysis of causes was the following:
According to the process specification and to the standard operating procedures, the pre-heating of the dimethoate was carried out in the water-bath at 40 - 50 degrees Celsius with a residence time of 2 - 2.5 hours. Despite of the standard operating instructions, the operator forgot to switch-off the valve of the steam heating up the water of the bath, thus extending residence / heating time for at least one hour. As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels.Further uninvestigation revealed that:Despite of the standard operating instructions for the pre-heating of dimethoate, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve (codes 5303 and 5401) heating up the water of the bath and the overpressure, due to the vapours produced in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels (code 5102). The plant design and process analysis were inadequate because the heating of the water bath was carried out directly with steam and not with hot water (codes 5307 and 5308).","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:According the dispersion model developped by the Laboratory of Physics of the Environment of a University, the combustion products of dimethoate reached (for SOx) a maximum concentration of 1.75 mg/mc at a distance of 100 metres from the water-bath (the maximum permissible concentration in the working environment is 5.32 mg/mc). Blood tests were carried out for the plant operators (dimethoate reduces the cholinesterase in the blood) but no effects were detected.MATERIAL LOSS:The cost of the material losses caused by the accident (damages to the water bath, the cables of the fan and loose of the contents of 20 barrels) has been estimated at 16,000 Euros.ECOLOGICAL HARM:When the Original Report was prepared. It was under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the wastewater treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or was partly released to the sea.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of:       Ecological component: marine or fresh water habitat - Affected Yes","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire was extinguished in 10 minutes by 10 people working in the company. As the fire was extinguished, three fire cars with 15 firemen from the Fire Brigade arrived and helped the personnel of the company. EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Local authority was immediately notified as well as environmental and other authorities. In order to avoid pollution of sea water by fire fighting extinguishing water, since its flow rate was too high and the pump which had to send it to the main waste water treatment plant was not adequate, the overflow was trapped in a pool made out of gypsum and limestone.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident the following measures were established:
1- the heating system of the water-bath was replaced by a new one whereby steam is heating water in a closed circuit and hot water is used to heat the water in the water-bath via a heat-exchanger. Both systems are controlled against high temperature by special systems which do not allow the water temperature in the bath to exceed the required temperature;
2- the barrels during  placing in the water-bath have to be protected so that they do not come into contact with heat-exchanger tubes;
3- the water in the water-bath is recycled to obtain homogeneous degree of heating.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, a new system was installed to ensure that, in case of fire, the extinguishing water is collected and safely neutralized.Useful references: According to the dispersion model developped by the Laboratory of Physics of the Environment of the University of Thessalonikiand taking into account the amount involved in the accident and the meteorological data, the combustion products of dimethoate reached a maximum concentration (for SOx) of 1.75 mg/mc at a distance of 100 metres from the installation (the maximum permissible concentration of SOx in the working environment is about 5.32 mg/mc)."

In parallel with this action, the mayors of the towns in the vicinity were informed. The firefighters, the ambulance, the National Public Health and Medical Officer Service (ANTSZ), the relevant environmental inspectorate and the civil protection units were alarmed. Constant air pollution monitoring was carried out. Elimination began after the alarming of these bodies. Emergency measures - Remarks: The unloading of the chlorine from tanker to storage tank was begun on 24th July 1999. At this time 4850 kg was unloaded. Purging was carried out and the pipelines were removed. The tanker was reconnected on 29th July again and unloading was begun, which was completed on 30th July. The pipeline was purged after unloading. At this time the tanker remained connected for unloading. On 7th September, the unloader was intended to be sprayed by sand and so that the tanker would not be affected by this action, they intended to fix it. At the fixation, the nitrogen connection was removed, it was no problem, however the operator observed leakage during the disconnection of liquid chlorine discharging pipe. At this time the valve was attempted to close, which did not move, and the chlorine began to leak. After this, the worker on the ground put on a breathing equipment and attempted to close the apparatus. The valve spindle rotated freely, therefore the manual valve was inoperable. According to the operator, based on the position of the handle, the bottom spring safety valve was in closed condition. The alarm was initiated by the chief foreman, the firefighter brigade of the facility moved to the site and started the absorption of the constantly leaking chlorine by establishing water shield. In the meantime the alarmed units arrived to the site (firefighters, policemen, chemical rescue team of BC Rt.). The arrived civil protection unit carried out constant measurements. Hazardous material did not get into the atmosphere. The chlorine
leakage ceased at 5 pm, 30 minutes later the units returned to their
quarters. After this the damage assessment and the reconstruction works
began.Official action taken - legal action: There was no legal action. The expert's report on the damage was accepted by all authorities. Environmental authority requested Action plan, the implementation of which was checked. Official action taken - other official action: The operator had to pay 4,000 Euro fee for the labour protection authority.","Measures to prevent recurrence: The managing director released an Action plan including 11 clauses to avoid further accidents, which were presented to the workers and they have it kept strictly.

This accident is notified because of the confinement of 180 persons for 2.5 hours (near the notification criterion of the Seveso directive of 500 persons X hours). It is classified at level 3 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Comity of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive, because 18 members of the public were injured.
","The pressure rise appears to have been caused by the presence of a contaminant in the tank, which triggered the decomposition reaction of the substance. With the approval of the firemen, the emergency release vents of the tank were opened in order to avoid the risk of explosion.","Visible from several km away and carried along by strong winds, the cloud headed towards a sawmill and 4 warehouses situated in an uninhabited zone. Atmospheric measurements showed that the toxic thresholds were not reached. Eighteen employees in neighbouring enterprises complained of headaches and difficulty in breathing; 7 were given treatment, 4 were put on oxygen, but none was hospitalized. The health services warned health professionals in the area concerned on the toxic risk run by the population and to draw their attention to any clinical indications likely to appear.","The onsite emergency response services,&nbsp; helped by some dozens of firemen flushed the tank for cooling it down and abating the irritant vapours, which were thus diluted and recovered in the retention basins of the site. A crisis unit was set up at the Prefecture, while a medical team was dispatched to the scene. A safety perimeter was set up and the Onsite Emergency Plan was activated at 12.25 hrs. The confinement measures affected nearly 180 people: the employees of the site and of enterprises situated within a radius of 1 km and about sixty pupils in an infant school 4 km outside the safety perimeter. At about 13.30, the chemical decomposition reaction was brought under control. The strong wind eventually dispersed the cloud. At about 16.00, the safety perimeter and the onsite emergency plan were lifted simultaneously. The tank involved is placed out of service for sampling and analysis.","The operator contacted his sub-contractor in order to obtain information on the state of the tank (quality of cleaning carried out, history of the substances it had contained, etc.).

58,1190,Major Accident,Chemical installations ,Release of ethyl acetate in a synthetic resin manufacturing plant,2019-06-08 15:00:00,2019-06-08 15:10:00,"On 8 June 2019, a secondary reaction initiated by the addition of peroxide resulted in foaming of the mixture in a reactor vessel. The workers noticed that the mixture was behaving peculiarly, i.e. the manometer on the reactor vessel was showing a sharp increase in pressure. The shift supervisor was informed. He immediately called the emergency services.Duration of the incident: 10 minutes.
The planned addition of the secondary initiator led to an increase in pressure and temperature in the reactor vessel and then to the release of pressure via the rupture disc into a catch tank (with a volume approximately 2.5 times that of the reactor vessel) and then, in turn, to a release of pressure into the atmosphere via a rupture disc in the catch tank. The triggering of the rupture disc was signalled in the process control system. Approximately 5,500&nbsp;kg of ethyl acetate escaped and evaporated, carrying with it product components in the form of droplets. An area of approximately 60,000&nbsp;m² to the north of the factory site was contaminated. As the substance is not water-soluble, no water pollution (through rain) has taken place. Nobody was injured.
Safety measures:Excessive pressure in the reactor vessel is released by means of a safety valve and rupture disc through a pipe into a catch tank. Excessive pressure in the catch tank is, in turn, released into the atmosphere by means of a safety valve and rupture disc.","Subsequent reconstruction established that there had been a mix-up with the tanks at the start of the procedure when preparing the solid peroxide, which first had to be dissolved in ethyl acetate. Workers on the early shift correctly put the ethyl acetate solvent into holding tank 1, but incorrectly put the solid peroxide into holding tank 2. It should also have been put into holding tank 1. Consequently, no reaction occurred. Workers on the following shift checked holding tank 1 to see whether the peroxide had dissolved. However, it was not possible to tell from a mere visual inspection that the tank contained only liquid ethyl acetate. As a result, the product batch did not achieve full conversion as expected, which meant that, when the peroxide for the secondary reaction was added, the conversion suddenly took place more vigorously than expected, with the effects described above.","On-site:One person twisted their ankle during the evacuation, no injuries, staff could resume their work later.
Minor damage, replacement of the broken rupture disc, repairs, and testing and cleaning costs. Costs: EUR 20,000.
Off-site:One woman had matted hair.
Contaminated area with a radius of 300 m NNE. Costs: EUR 500,000.
Very minor surface contamination by a non-water-soluble adhesive acrylic resin. Evaporation of 5,500 kg of ethyl acetate.
On-siteEUR 20,000Off-site:EUR 500,000","The volunteer fire brigade was alerted, the production building was evacuated, and the neighbouring processes in the hall of the production building were shut down. Air testing was carried out by the volunteer fire brigade after the incident, and no adverse effects could be detected. The public was warned by radio, and windows and doors in the surrounding area were closed.
The contaminated areas were assessed by the insurer’s experts and there were direct reports of damage by those affected. The insurance will cover the clean-up costs and deal with the external damage that occurred.
It has not yet been possible to identify any specific surface contamination, but this is very likely to be detectable on roof tops. What measures will need to be taken cannot yet be determined.","Expert recommendations:

Clear labelling of the reactor vessel tanks.
Harmonisation of the labelling on site with the production specifications, the batch protocols and the process control system (PCS); harmonisation with other plant documentation.
Training workers to apply the ‘second pair of eyes’ principle; differentiation between critical dosages/additions (checked by the shift supervisor in accordance with the ‘second pair of eyes’ principle) and less critical dosages/additions (checked by two shift workers in accordance with the ‘second pair of eyes’ principle), with documentation of this by the plant manager/production manager in the production specifications/batch protocols.
Bolting shut any unused manholes/handholes on the tanks.
Dispensing is to stop automatically if it is not confirmed by a worker that the reaction has started.
Setting out the criteria in the production specifications/batch protocols for determining whether the reaction has started.
As with the reactor vessel, the start of the reaction should be shown in the PCS.
Assessing the accumulation of pressure during the course of the reaction in order to ensure that the rupture discs are of a sufficient size (maximum accumulation of 15%); reviewing existing procedures; for new procedures before the Research &amp; Development Department starts production.
In the short term, implementing an automatic trigger for the addition of an inhibitor.
Modifying the catch tank.
Installing a cyclone separator downstream of the catch tank.
Reviewing and evaluating the catch tank with a view to optimisation; implementing any necessary improvements.
Reviewing and revising the production specifications and the batch protocols.Risk analyses (HAZOP) for defined reference procedures to define requirements for process control technology and safety-oriented controls.
Drafting and implementing instructions for identification of key safety data for new procedures by the Research &amp; Development Department before production starts, as well as determining the responsibilities and other content.
Risk analyses should be carried out before new production procedures become operational in the production process; instructions setting out actions and responsibilities should be drawn up and implemented.
As part of the HAZOP studies and the revision of the explosion protection document, the issue of “adding a solid to a container of flammable liquid” should be considered and safeguards should be put in place. These should also be implemented for existing procedures. The explosion protection document should be revised.

Additional measures taken by the operator:

&nbsp;Safety data sheets are stored on the intranet.
A brief overview of safety data sheets for new raw materials is provided in the Health, Safety, Environment (HSE) / Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) software.
The tasks of the shift supervisors are being redefined.

Optimisation of the catch tank with regard to separation of the liquid/gaseous phases."
59,469,Other Event,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"On an installation producing 2-azo-bis-methylburtyronitrile, there was an explosion in a reservoir connected to a dryer",1999-07-11 11:53:00,1999-07-11 00:00:00,"On an installation producing 2-azo-bis-methylburtyronitrile, there was an explosion in a reservoir connected to a dryer. The unit was at the end of a 14-day batch run, and the accident happened during drying of the installation.","The accident occurred during drying. The dryer was washed with water, this procedure finishing at about 10.30. The next operation was to be the draining of the reservoir (containing water from the dryer) into the acid drain for final treatment. Because one of the plates of the dryer was broken, and the dryer was not therefore functioning correctly, the quantity of 2-azo-bis-methylburtyronitrile in this reservoir was greater than normal. The reservoir was 2/3 full. The operator expected some difficulties in draining the reservoir, and so heated the water using a flexible steam pipe (128°C). This manoeuvre lasted 15 minutes. The normal rinsing temperature is 40°C, since the product is unstable above 50°C. After a delay of some 20 minutes, the product decayed until it forced the top off the reservoir in an explosion. The cover, fixed by 50 bolts, was torn off, while the bolts and nuts remained intact. The combustion gases then spread round the installation and caught fire. The combustion produced large deposits of carbon black.","There was damage to the equipment involved: reservoir, dryer, filter, etc. and also to the inflammable materials in the installation: plastic, electric cables, PVC tubes, duckboards etc. No-one was hurt because the accident occurred during shift change (11.45-12.00). There was no damage to the environment.",Emergency services were mobilised rapidly after the explosion. The measures taken were essentially of repair and clean-up.,"The following lessons were drawn:&nbsp;- reconsideration of the whole range of procedures for the production of 2-azo-bis-methylburtyronitrile, in particular in order to avoid reaching unstable temperatures.&nbsp;- redesigning the operation of cleaning the dryer so as to avoid accumulation of the product.&nbsp;- strengthening the training of the personnel concerning the risks associated with the substance, in particular the danger of decomposition when heated."

61,596,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Explosion of a tank containing 40 tonnes of a mixture of Cyclohexanone 55% and Dymethoate 45%,1988-07-17 06:15:00,1988-07-17 00:00:00,"On July 17 at 06:15 tank D-103, containing 40 tonnes of a mixture of Cyclohexanone 55% and Dymethoate 45% caught fire and exploded. Initially, a strong whistle from this tank had been noticed but it was supposed to be a steam leak. Repair of the steam duct had been organized. The operators sent on the top of the tank for the repair works noticed a cloud with a yellow-green colour escaping from the tank and gave the alarm. A large fire developped and a strong explosion occurred 6 or 7 minutes after the whistle was noticed. Combustion products of cyclohexanone and dimethoate together with the toxic substances from the insulating and plastic materials of the nearby pipings, structures and plants involved in the fire were released into the environment. Due to the explosion, the front bottom part of the tank was thrown towards the Rogor plant and the remaining part, as a missile, against the reinforced concrete wall of the control room about 45 m away. The fire that followed the explosion had been extinguished by water-sprays in about 20 minutes with the intervention of the plant firemen and the National Fire Brigade. Although most of the water used in fire fighting operations had been contained within the tanks dikes (after the interception of the sewer network and by means of dedicated pumps), a certain part of it flowed into the nearby Lavello channel and then in the sea. Prohibition of bathing followed. The degree of pollution of the air, soil and water due to the release of toxic substances and combustion products as well as the fire extinguishing water were continuously controlled (the results of these checks are shown in a document attached to the Original Report). People was warned to careful wash fruits and vegetables before to eat them and to follow the normal rules of personal hygiene.
When the Original Report was prepared (27/08/1988) the type of danger was still present because traces of Rogor have been found in some samples taken in the discharge water from FARMOPLANT and in the Lavello torrent. Besides, the danger of water contamination in case of persistent rain existed.","CAUSE:When the Original Report the causes were still under investigation, but at least two hypotheses may be advanced for this accident:1- being known that Rogor contained in the tank was out of specification, secondary exothermic reactions could have occurred resulting in the overpressurization of the tank up to its failure and causing the release of Rogor and cyclohexanone. Ignition of cyclohexanone vapours due to the exothermic reactions might have caused the following fire and the explosion.2- operational error that could have caused the overpressurization or tank failure (leakage) resulting in the release of Rogor and cyclohexanone. Ignition of cyclohexanone vapours due to unknown causes may have caused the following fire and the explosion.Both cases resulted in tank failure (code 5101) and liquid release.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:The day of the accident, 163 people with gas intoxication symptoms were carried out to the Massa's Hospital. The following three days (July 20) others 40 people were hospitalized for 1 or 2 days. 56 people with gas intoxication symptoms were instead carried out to the Carrara's Hospital and 3 of them were hospitalized. Blood samples had been taken from people directly involved in the accident (FARMOPLANT personnel and fire fighters), but the analysis did not detected anything abnormal.&nbsp;MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion projected the tank towards the plant for the formulation of liquid pesticides as far as the reinforced concrete wall of the nearby control room, which resulted seriously damaged.

Activities were performed to create a bridge between the two tanks just before the accident. An explosion of tank D1102, which caused a second explosion, the explosion of tank D102a. The following day it turned out that tank D102a was insulated with white asbestos, part of which was blown away through the explosion. A small third explosion took place outside the tanks, because benzoic acid had streamed out of tank D102a. Due to a fragment of either one of the exploded tanks, tank D151 at approx. 40m. distance got a leak. This tank contained toluene which streamed into the tank pit. the explosions also created some fires around the tanks, and a big fire in a chemical waste depot. Some buildings and process equipment was damaged by several fragments.","The most probable cause was ignition of the explosive air/mixture by drilling or cutting activities. This happened following several human procedural errors which accumulated to the final result. These procedural errors concerned:- the contractors had all the necessary permits to do the job, but after investigation of the incident it became clear that the permits were issued on false grounds;- no explosion measurements had been carried out before permission was given to start work on the tank. In retrospect and after research had been done as as a result of the incident, it turned out that the safety awareness that benzoic acid is flammable and can possibly lead to explosion was not sufficiently known by DSM Chemical's employees.","Casualties: 10 in total, namely: 6 persons killed by explosion; 1 person severely injured by explosion/fire and hospitalized (died later in spring 92); 3 persons lightly injured, but not hospitalized.Material damage: approximately 7.5 million Euros in total, varying from broken windows to a completely destroyed plant. These costs can be specified as follows:- costs for DSM: material damage larger than 7 million Euros;- costs for disaster control: no information available but estimated between 5,000 and 15,000 Euros (time used by personnel on evaluations, research etc.)","The main problem after the incident were the large amounts of white
asbestos scattered around and outside the establishment. Sufficiently
protected fire brigade personnel took care of the removal of the
asbestos on the days immediately after the explosion.

Methamidophos is a solid at ambient conditions. The goal was to liquefy the product which had to be mixed with other components on Monday, for the fabrication of different types of formulated pesticides. The heating rooms started automatically at 6.00 am on Sunday: the operating temperature of 80°C was programmed on Friday; also the safety temperature was set at 100°C. There was no other operation during the weekend. So there was nobody working on the site during the weekend. At 11.00 am on Sunday a foreman came to control the heating operation: the temperature was 80°C and there was no sign of a problem. At 20.30 the external emergency services received complains from residents around the establishment about a gas odour. A fire brigade came on site to control the situation with the foreman who had been called as mentioned in the emergency plan of the establishment. On 21.45 the source of the odours is detected: white fumes are escaping from the roof of the building containing the heating rooms and other installations. The firemen entered the building and located with difficulty the source because all the room was full of white fumes. The heating chambers were burning, also explosions occurred. It was the explosion of some drums in the heating chambers themselves. The plastic roof of the building, some big-bags with inert products and some small empty plastic drums were burning.","The identification of the causes is not definitive.
One of the suspected causes is the use of a too high heating temperature (80°C; although the laboratory had recommended a heating temperature of 40): above 45°C methamidophos begins to decompose. One of the products of decomposition is methyl mercaptan, an extremely flammable gas. This situation was known and specific measures were taken to avoid an ignition of any explosive atmosphere: sufficient ventilation, use of appropriate Ex material. The unique possible source of ignition in this case is the self ignition of the product itself. This self ignition temperature is unknown.A failure in the heating rooms (regulation or safety) can at the same time have lead to a higher temperature in the heating rooms, sufficient to ignite the flammable atmosphere or the wooden pallets. The quality of the technical methamidophos in the drums can have been different and possibly had a much lower self ignition temperature, near the normal heating temperature.Tests are done on the substance to define the self ignition
temperature, also functional tests of the control and safety devices of
the heating rooms are in progress.","Destruction of the heating chambers and of a part of the roof of the building, damage to the conditioning installations. The unit was shut down for a week.

At around 7.42&nbsp;p.m., the driver of the road tanker connected the facility-side hose with dry coupling to the tanker using an adapter. The flow path up to the last valve on the tanker was then cleared by opening the valves; the valves of the sampling equipment were opened.&nbsp;
When the tanker driver realised that the hand lever of the valve on the tanker could not be operated by means of the adapter and dry coupling, he disconnected the coupling without closing the valves on the facility side. This caused residual substances still in the hose from the previous draining to be released due to the tank pressure applied via the sampling equipment.
The residual substances released struck the tanker driver's face and upper body, even though he was wearing the appropriate protective clothing and helmet with protective visor. The tanker driver collapsed. An emergency call was made immediately and first aid was started. After being given first aid by the emergency services, the tanker driver was taken to hospital, where he died after about one hour.
The above is a description of the facts currently known.","Failure to close the valves on the facility side of the connection line to the pump.
The valves on the facility-side flow path to the pump were not closed.","Medical examination of the person who witnessed the accident and the paramedics as a precaution.
r.",Closure of the shut-off valves in the pump flow path.Removal of the released product.Closure of the site area until investigations had been provisionally concluded.,"Technical measures:
1) In order to prevent product from being released from the coupling when work instructions are not followed due to human error, the adapter used has been modified.Non-return valve on the adaptor:The adapter for use on tankers without a dry coupling counterpart is fitted with a non-return valve to prevent any residual products in the hose from being released if the union nut comes loose without having disconnected the dry coupling.
2) Pneumatically operated valves around the sampling equipment:The pipe connection to the sampling equipment, which is connected in parallel with the product path, has been fitted with pneumatically operated valves, which only open when the drain pump is running.Organisational measures:
1) Instructions to tanker drivers:The instruction forms used for the initial and annual training of tanker drivers have been updated and are now available in eight languages. Drivers are given a copy to keep.New tanker drivers are trained by operator staff in how to operate the installation and are allowed to operate it independently only once they have completed this training.
2) Work instructions:The work instructions for tanker drivers have been amended in line with the modified installation and allow tankers to be drained:- with the necessary PPE but without using a respirator mask when the dry coupling is used directly, i.e. without the adapter;- only with the necessary PPE and using a respirator mask as an additional safeguard against swallowing and inhalation of product residues when an adapter is used.&nbsp;
The work instructions are posted in the facility in three languages. The following additions have been made:- Images showing how to correctly connect to the facility;- Operating instructions concerning the hazardous substances to be drained;- Operating instructions concerning PPE to be used, including breathing protection.&nbsp;
3) Risk assessment of the tanker draining facility following the modification:After testing and introduction of the above-mentioned modification, a new risk assessment was carried out on the tanker draining facility by the external works safety expert. The technical and organisational measures that had been implemented at the time of the assessment were found to be ‘completed and effective’.
&nbsp;
4) Working towards fitting tankers with dry coupling counterparts:
The tank farm operator itself has no business relationship with the transport companies delivering the product; it merely acts as a warehouse keeper for a fee.
A letter was sent to the product purchaser asking it to encourage the transport companies delivering the product to fit tankers with dry couplings, in order to increase safety during transhipment and prevent releases of product.

In this case the accident is classified at level 3 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive applying the criteria on amounts of substances (1% to 10% of the upper threshold).Considering the peculiarity of this kind of storage and the relevance of the event it has been classified as ""other event"".",Following investigation a gas leakage was found on a (DN50) dead-end line connected to a DN150 branch and part of the purging circuit which had been partially dismantled in 1987. The gas probably reached the electrical appliance room via cable conduits. It is not known precisely how long the pipe had been leaking: the leakage may have started quite a long time before the accident. ,"Financial and material damage was limited: a building showed cracks, cables and control cabinets had to be tested, a cast iron lid of a venting chamber was blown several meters away.

","Emergency shutdown systems and the alarm were released. A security perimeter was set up on-site and all activities were shutdown.The piping system involved in the accident, buried 3m underground, was isolated and purged. Inspection of the piping was complicated by the fact that the leaking gas had iced the ground for 2.5 m around the pipe; the operation was concluded after 2 days.The Classified Installation Inspectorate suggested issuing&nbsp; a prefectural order making&nbsp;&nbsp; the presentation of a complete accident investigation report and the documentation of the repair work a condition for resuming activities. The Inspectorate further requested an action plan for the treatment of embrittlement points like the one found on the sector involved in the accident, the installation of gas detection systems in all places not already equipped and in all cable channels. The operator is to substitute the pipe sector concerned and remove the dead-end line section. A study is to be performed on the caption of the other wells: dismantling of dead-end lines on old piping, corrosion diagnostics on the other ones.",Measures for improving the gas tightness of electric appliance rooms are being put in place.  The studies may lead to the installation of a servo system shutting down the electrical supply in case of gas detection. The leakage in the piping may also have been caused by a metallurgical default: complementary investigations have been started.

the intermittent failure of an active equipment component (a switch), leading it to detect time-outs at random on the various safety network controllers;
a redundancy problem due to a fault in the programming of the controller and a problem regarding compatibility of software versions.

The equipment was designed for a minimum temperature of -12 °C. The damaged section developed a crack of 5-6 cm caused by the pipe freezing and began to leak with the thaw. The accumulation of water in the piping resulted from the presence of wet gas and the fact that no product flowed through the unused branch. An inspection 8 years previously had not detected any significant loss of metal thickness in this section, which was classified at a low criticality level.
The leak took a long time to locate because the gas is colourless and because of the site and height of the section, the non-activation of the gas detectors in the unit and insufficient information from the operative in the control room. The operative manages stocks of diluent per item of equipment and per hour, but does not have any summary view of the overall daily consumption of diluent across the entire unit. This figure can only be obtained by means of a detailed analysis, which pinpoints the start of the leak to more than 3 days before the accident. The day before, abnormal consumption of diluent had been detected on the display screen, but the low pressure in the section, the height of the piping and the colourless nature of the product meant that the leak could not be located precisely. An operative found it by chance the following day when climbing scaffolding erected for planned maintenance.",This discharge of 8.5 t of CH3Cl over 80 hours &ndash; compared with 150 t discharged annually &ndash; did not have any impact in terms of acute or chronic toxicity for the neighbourhood.,"Operatives wearing self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) temporarily stopped the leak using an active leak sealing system (polymer strip type), and a monitoring procedure was put in place.","The damaged piping was removed a few weeks later and the operator took a number of measures to remove or monitor the presence of water in pipes with the same characteristics and carrying toxic or flammable fluids in times of extreme cold: sections concerned put out of service, removal of water from the pipes or enhanced vigilance in the event of meteorological hazards."
77,1133,Near Miss,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of carbon disulphide from a tank wagon in a plant for the manufacture of pharmaceutical raw materials,2017-11-14 09:20:00,2017-11-14 09:20:00,"A leak in an interconnector (metal fabric hose) led to the release of carbon disulphide.The member of staff performing the work immediately noticed this and closed the relevant ball valve, which stopped the release of the substance.
Safety functions:The fire brigade, which is kept on standby (in close proximity, fully equipped) whenever carbon disulphide is being unloaded, immediately created a foam carpet.","The causes of this event are complex.

Lack of knowledge and consequent assumptions about the end of the transhipment.
Lack of communication between the firm and the staff responsible for filling the tanks about the operation of the unloading gantry and storage tank.
Incorrect fitting of the metal fabric hose, which led to the release of the substance.
Lack of awareness within the firm about good practice, or of noticing and being willing to speak out if good practice is not followed.

When carbon disulphide is unloaded, the entire load is normally transferred to two storage tanks. The member of staff carrying out the unloading was not aware that the unloading process did not lead directly into the storage tank, but via an intermediate tank.At a low ambient temperature, carbon disulphide becomes viscous, which results in the flow becoming blocked, the intermediate tank reaching its maximum filling level and the flow pump stopping.Only when the contents of the intermediate tank have flowed out can the pump be restarted.
Due to poor communication between the firm and those responsible for unloading, and to the lack of knowledge of the staff member during the unloading, it was erroneously assumed that the transhipment operation was finished.
The release of the carbon disulphide occurred at a point where the metal fabric hose was damaged, directly adjacent to the unloading gantry.There was a sharp kink in the hose immediately after the flange connection. This is where the leak occurred.Sharply bending, compressing, twisting or kinking a metal fabric hose is to be avoided.
On the basis of the operator’s documentation, it was not possible to determine whether the setup at the time of the accident corresponded to the original design or whether a different metal fibre hose had been installed in the meantime.Although all participants in an on-site meeting were of the opinion that the damaged installation did not meet the standards, nobody in the company (over a long period of time) had questioned the situation.",One injured person.,No further protective measures were needed because the leakage of the substance was stopped and the situation was under control.,"
Technical repair.
Immediate verification of the processes of unloading the materials involved in the incident on the entire site.Revision of the operational procedures for unloading; Optimisation of the guidance documents to be used (work instruction, checklists).
Improvements to the safety management system with regard to the follow-up of events and internal communication on lessons learned from them.

Revision of the reporting system (internal, external) including training; Improving emergency management, improvements to processes for communication with external bodies newly agreed with the authorities and put in place."

Ethylene oxide leaked through a hair-crack in a weld on the distillation column K-303 (aldehyde column) and contaminated the rock-wool insulation of a level indicator. The leak was caused by a hair-crack due to low cycle fatigue. The released ethylene oxide reacted with moisture to form non-volatile polyethylene glycols (PEG) in the insulation material. PEG accumulated in the course of time. On the day of the accident, the metal covering of the insulation was removed in order to repair the level indicator. Air leaked into the insulation material already soaked with PEG, causing its decomposition and initiating auto-oxidation. The auto-oxidation of the PEG ignited the insulation and the resulting heat flux heated the metal wall of the piping of the level instrumentation system. The heating of the stagnant liquid of the level instrument stand pipe caused the ethylene oxide to decompose. The decomposition continued into the column K-303 which exploded (the confined vapour explosion began in the lower section of the column). The gas supply line to column K-302 (carrying gases from the head of column K-303) was torn off and the escaping gas caught fire. After the pressure decreased, the flames backed into the column K-302 and caused an internal explosion (approximately 26 seconds after the first explosion). The two explosions caused the impact of debris in other sections of the ethylene oxide/glycol installation and was followed by a huge fire. The recycle gas loop was hit by debris and the released gas burned as a jet-fire. The plant fire fighting team was able to confine the fire and to put it under control in less than one hour. The city fire brigade arrived on the scene but its intervention was not necessary.","CAUSES:

the insulation and the resulting heat flux heated the metal wall of the
piping of the level instrumentation system. The heating of the stagnant
liquid of the level instrument stand pipe caused the ethylene oxide to

insulation material with a high specific surface area, the insufficient
in-depth inspections for leaks and also for the possible existence of
any accumulation of polyethylene glycols (PEG) and the lack of
inertization of parts of the equipment where stagnant zones of ethylene
oxide/water mixtures may be created (e.g. instrumentation stand pipes)

82,828,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion and fire-ball   in a peak saving station for natural gas occurred  during a routine exercise,1989-12-05 13:00:00,1989-12-05 00:00:00,"ENVIRONMENT AND ATMOSPHERICAL CONDITIONS:Ambient temperature = 7°C. Atmospheric Stability Class = C. Wind direction = 340° with a speed of ?? m/s.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The accident occurred in a peak saving station used to store liquefied natural-gas (LNG). The station included a natural gas liquefaction unit, a LNG storage and a LNG compression/vaporization/water bath Thurley vaporizer-facilities. During peak demands, LNG was pumped up to 82 barg to 8 vaporisers from which the gas was injected into the transmission line to 72 barg. As a routine exercise to verify the availability of the site to export gas, the equipment had to be brought to a ""1- hour"" stand-by condition and LNG used to cool down pipes and pumps between the storage tanks and vaporisers. The Thurley vaporiser consisted of a large steel water tank, the water being heated by 6 gas burners. The air supply for the burners was coming from a single local fan via ductwork (up to 24"" diameter). The LNG passed through tubes inside the water bath, evaporating and warming up to 20°C. The LNG inlet to the vaporiser was controlled by a motorised hand indicated control (HIC) valve from the control room. An additional emergency shut-down (ESD) valve could be operated locally or remotely. Between these valves there were four drain valves and a relief valve. The drain valves were 0.5 m and 1.5 m above the ground level. The lower level drain valves were the ones normally used.On December 5, an availability exercise was carried out and five of the 8 vaporisers had to be brought to a ""1- hour"" stand-by condition. Two operators were working on A, B and C vaporisers and other two on E and F vaporisers. The shift engineer was present to start-up the LNG pumps and open the main valve. Vaporisers A, B and C were cooled down according to the normal procedure (admission of small amounts of LNG and low level drain valves opened to accelerate the cooling) and vaporisers E and F were being closed when the pumps were started resulting in a jet of LNG from one of the open drain valves. 30 seconds later there was an explosion and fire-ball. Two operators received burns to their hands and face. The fire-ball was approximately 40m x 25 m.","CAUSES:The LNG jet occurred because the drain lines were opened and venting when the pump was started. The operators did not make sure that the valves were closed. The released natural gas was drawn into one of the air intake to a vaporiser burner and was ignited by a pilot flame, flashing back and igniting the gas that was present in the area following the cooling down exercise. Even if it was not known, due to an inadequate process analysis, the cooling down exercise involving the release of LNG from 5 vaporisers resulted in the presence of sufficient gas in the area to cause an explosion when ignited.The process was not adequately analyzed because it was not known that, following the cooling down procedure, in the area there was the presence of sufficient gas to cause an explosion if ignited. Also, the location of the air intake to the vaporizer burners was not adequate &nbsp;","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Two operators received burns to their hands and face because of the fire-ball. Approximately, 40 rescue personnel were involved in the accident (7 fire tenders, 2 fire chiefs, 3 ambulances and 4 police cars attended) but nobody was injured.MATERIAL LOSS:The accident caused minor structural damage to the plant (paint damages,cracked gauge glass).Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The internal emergency teams were called and the operators closed the liquefied natural gas outlet valves

Also external ambulance services (3 cars) and police intervention (4 cars) were requested.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- the system of work adopted for cooling down the pipework, valves and pumps to be modified and the drain valves not to be opened to accelerate cooling so that no gas is released to the atmosphere during this operation;
2- the air intake to the vaporiser burners was relocated out of the classified Zone 1. Another site in the country that was using a similar system had also been modified."

They then attended the POCl3 Plant along with the Site Fire Officers who set up a water-curtain in order to scrub the fumes escaping from the plant building. The Fire Services arrived at the scene and maintained the water-curtain. The Ambulance Service also attended the site.The Police attended the site and set up road-blocks in the vicinity in order to restrict public access.,"The Operator concluded that at the temperatures seen by the screws, the chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking (CISCC) failure mechanism observed following the incident was not foreseeable. Health and Safety Laboratories (HSL) concluded that CISCC was a plausible and hence predictable degradation mechanism for the screws at the temperatures seen and the Competent Authority thus concluded that the failure of the screws due to CISCC was foreseeable.As a result of the findings of this investigation, HSE drafted and released the document entitled ‘SPC/Tech/Gen/39 - Chloride induced stress corrosion cracking of cold formed 304 stainless steel fasteners at ambient temperatures’. This was subsequently replaced by the HSL RR regarding general SCC issues."

85,822,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion and fire in a hydrocracker unit caused by error in opening a valve between the HP and the LP separators,1987-03-22 07:00:00,1987-03-22 00:00:00,"ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:The morning was fine and cold with only a slight breeze.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A control valve on the liquid line between the HP and the LP Separators was opened in error and the liquid allowed to drain. High pressure hydrogen passed uncontrolled into the closed LP Separator which had limited pressure relief capacity. It overpressurised rupturing at an estimated pressure of 50 bar. The explosion disintegrated the separator and also damaged other vessels and pipes. Released flammable substances were ignited resulting in jet-fires.The hydrocracker unit was commissioned in the early 1970's. The potential for high pressure gas breakthrough into the LP separator was recognized in the design and the flow control valves in the line from the HP separator to the LP separator had provided to automatically close should liquid level in the HP Separator reach a critical pre-determined low point. The safety system was arranged to operate from either of a pair of low level magnetic float switches mounted on a bridle tube attached to the HP Separator. In a safety audit and in a review of pressure relief capacity within the hydrocracker complex which were carried out in 1975, the operator of the refinery concluded that high pressure gas breakthrough into the LP Separator would not arise because there was a safety trip actuated by low liquid levels.As a consequence the pressure relief valve on the LP Separator was sized only for fire engulfment on the vessel and was of comparatively small size. Throughout the 1970's the output of the hydrocracker was limited by a series of operational problems. By the early 1980's these were mostly overcome and throughput started to rise to exceed the design capacity of 23,000 barrels/day. At these high flow rates it was discovered that the liquid in the HP Separator became very turbulent. The rapidly changing liquid levels caused spurious trips of the control valve which in turn caused severe operational difficulties. The low liquid level control valve trip system also lost favour for various other reasons. For example frequent blockages of the pipework leading to the level detectors caused by build up of hard carbon residue and by the solidification of waxy liquids in cold weather. The system was unreliable and therefore was distrusted. Furthermore trips would be over-ridden prior to shut-down so that residual liquid in the HP separator could be emptied. At low throughputs or during standby operation trips would also be over-ridden so that the valves could be opened to allow liquid remaining in the line from the HP separator to be blown clear to prevent accumulation of solidifying wax. As a consequence, in the early 1980's the control valve trip was removed and not replaced. It was left to the operators to detect dangerous low levels and close the valves when they judged it appropriate. Removal of the safety system was authorized at operations supervisor level. Maintenance and instrument engineering managers were aware of the situations and turned a blind eye to it.",INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:A control valve on the liquid line between the HP and the LP Separators was opened in error and the liquid allowed to drain. High pressure hydrogen passed uncontrolled into the closed LP Separator which had limited pressure relief capacity. It overpressurised rupturing at an estimated pressure of 50 bar.CAUSES:The accident occurred because of an operator error (due to both the insufficient training of the operator and to the inappropriate procedures) in opening the control valve on the liquid line from the HP to the LP separator without noticing that the liquid contents in the HP vessel was draining away. Alarms did not operate because they had been previously disconnected without taking into account the decrease in safety. The main reason for the disconnection of the alarms was due to avoid operational difficulties because of the insufficient design capacity of the plant.,"EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:8 people were directly involved in the explosion and the subsequent fire (1 person was killed by explosion). The smoke from the fire did not affected the locality. The number of people put at risk by the missiles thrown by the LP separator explosion were about 200. MATERIAL LOSS:The accident caused extensive damage to vessels, pipework and buildings within the hydrocracker complex (the cost of rebuilding of the hydrocracker has been estimated in about 7 MECU).Outside the establishment, damages occurred in an adjacent factory (rupture of a steam line and damages to a building caused by a large fragment of metal through the roof).The cost of this damage has been estimated to be about 0.007 MECU.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OTHER:A small radioactive source, part of a level detection unit, was lost in the blast. It is presumed to have landed in its heavy container on deep mud flats to buried to a considerable depth. It presents absolutely no danger to anyone.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA:The approximate extent of broken windows and cladding and the points were the missiles had thrown are shown on a map attached to the Original Report. The effects of the LP separator burst were equivalent to those of an explosion of 90 kg of TNT.Disruption of community life: Outwith the hydrocracker unit, the effects of the explosion were not severe, except for one nearby factory were a steam line was ruptured and a large metal fragment was thrown through the roof of a building. The smoke from the fire did not affect the locality.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Before evacuating the control room, operator initiated the emergency shut-down and venting system of the hydrocracker unit. The on-site emergency procedure was activated. This included the shut-down of the entire refinery, the evacuation of non-essential personnel, the mobilization of the refinery fire brigade and the call on-site of engineering management staff. The extensive refinery fire fighting system was quickly brought into use.The area major incident control committee (comprising Police, Fire Brigade and representatives from major companies in the area) was called into operation to co-ordinate the emergency measures. Fire brigades from Central Scotland attended. Supplies of equipment essential for fire fighting were brought on-site from companies in the locality under a mutual aid system. EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Road blocks were set up. Occupiers of neighbouring factories were asked to inspect their sites for damages. It was not necessary to evacuate any housing.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident the following measures were established:
1- during the rebuilding of the hydrocracker, a full pressure relief on the LP separator, as well as improved instrumentation and fail-safe shut-off valves in series with level-control valves to be included;
2- rigorous procedures to be adopted in order to drain the HP separator of liquid as shut-down;
3- the systems for reporting plant defects, for testing interlocks and trips, for authorising equipment changes and for training operators have been tightened up;
4- routine audits to be carried out rigorously. 

Senior management were taking a much closer interest in the safety performance of refinery departments.Useful references: The effects of the LP separator burst was estimated to be equivalent to those caused by an explosion of 90 kg of TNT."

more than 2 minutes, it is meant as an evacuation alarm. The assessment
team found this system inadequate in situations of acute danger (like
this incident).","Measures to prevent recurrence: The work instruction is altered to enlarge the minimal distance between vehicles and the installation.

The consequence of this change, particularly during upset conditions, was therefore not adequately assessed.Further prevention actions:All equipment that may have been subjected to over-pressure was thoroughly inspected. PSV use was reviewed to determine the failure mechanism. The PSV inspection interval was reduced to a 12 month interval. An investigation of the reasons for the steam control to be routinely run on manual was conducted. This concluded that routine operation on automatic was unlikely to be successful.

It had been restarted at 5.00 after some repairs. The area of the fat hopper that was affected was the upshot burner, which was emitting black smoke (pool fire). The plant's operators attempted to extinguish the fire with fire extinguishing balls, but the fire increased in intensity at about 9.42 (jet fire). The operator activated the internal emergency plan (POI), shut down the factory (by deflating the pipeline and stopping the circulation of thermal fluid) and evacuated the plant's 6 operators to the control room. The rescue services were alerted, but the on-site fire team intervened, managing to bring the fire under control by 10.15. The fire was extinguished at 11.44. Roughly 1 m³ of thermal fluid and a little under 3 t of ethylene were consumed by the fire. There were no casualties, but the hopper and nearby equipment suffered serious material damage estimated at EUR 3.6 million. The production line had to be shut down for 4 months.","The investigation carried out by the operator revealed that it was likely that lagging soaked in hot heat transfer fluid had caught fire. The ignition of the heat transfer fluid at 180 °C (the operating conditions of the fluid line), although below its self-ignition temperature (500 °C), is explained by the fact that the impregnation of the lagging with the fluid thereby lowered its self-ignition temperature. The heat released by the fire then caused the deformation of and a leak from equipment containing compressed ethylene, which in turn caught fire, leading to an augmentation in the intensity of the initial fire (jet fire).",The hopper and nearby equipment suffered serious material damage estimated at EUR 3.6 million.

the ADN unit admission valve is closed (this second valve is opened
only when the ADN unit needs cyclohexane), the DN50 mm branch pipe is
thus permanently kept up to pressure (2 to 3 bars). The steam heating,
controlled by a valve, has been in the ""off"" position since an unknown
date, for unknown reasons. It no longer maintains the cyclohexane in
liquid form.

In early December 2002, a cold snap caused the cyclohexane to solidify
in the branch pipe. The temperature varied greatly over the weekend of
15-16 December, and the resulting expansion and contraction of the
cyclohexane caused the branch pipe to rupture at the expansion loop
(hole about the size of the palm of a hand), being the part most
exposed to the changes in temperature because of its shape and position
up above the pipeway. 

On 16 December 2002 at about 9 a.m., the Olone unit shift crew noted a
poor supply of cyclohexane. Filters were changed, the pumps checked,
the DN100 mm main pipe inspected and the ADN unit interrogated. The
following day, as the problem persisted, a visual inspection of the
DN50 mm branch pipe was organised. The leak of cyclohexane was found by
smell: it had occurred on the expansion loop on the DN50 mm branch pipe
supplying the ADN unit.
","About 30 hours had elapsed between the beginning of the cyclohexane supply problems and the leak being stopped. The leak was initially estimated at a few tonnes. The operator took a physical stock 10 days later and reassessed the leak at between 850 and 1,200 tonnes.After the leak, the cyclohexane was mostly absorbed into the gravelly ground. Only a few small pools of solidified cyclohexane could be seen below the leak; a fraction of the cyclohexane also escaped into the atmosphere as gas. At the upper surface of the water table at a depth of some 15 metres, the cyclohexane tended to spread rapidly (floating pool). After a few days, the cyclohexane spill was in four forms in the subsoil: &nbsp;- A pool of cyclohexane floating at the top of the water table, representing 70 to 85% of the tonnage spilt from the leak;&nbsp;- Cyclohexane captured in the subsoil by capillary action representing 15 to 30 % of the tonnage spilt;&nbsp;- Cyclohexane dissolved in the water table (less than 1 % of the tonnage spilt);&nbsp;- Cyclohexane in gaseous form in the subsoil (less than 1% of the tonnage spilt).The pool of floating cyclohexane accounted for the largest part of the cyclohexane spilt. It was also the source of supply for the cyclohexane captured in the subsoil by capillary action, the cyclohexane dissolved in the water table and the cyclohexane present in gaseous form. The pollution of the water table, one of the biggest in the region in the last 10 years, is a risk of contamination for mains drinking water catchments and agricultural bore holes located below it. The cyclohexane did not catch fire or explode. The flash point was not reached. The overall cost of the leak and the actions that followed is estimated at 2 M euros.","When the leak was discovered, the valve at the start of the DN50 mm branch pipe was closed, immediately stopping the leak. The supply to the Olone unit returned to normal. An existing borehole, 30 m from the leak (bore n° 23), was put into operation in order to create an exhaust cone (flow = 900 m//h). The existing hydraulic barrier (network of 25 bore holes distributed around the chemicals plant creating a negative pressure of about 2 m aimed at preventing any downstream migration of pollution in the water table) was adapted so as to guarantee confinement of the pollution within the industrial site. At the end of August 2003, the situation on work undertaken was as follows:&nbsp;- 55 observation wells (diameter 115 mm) were bored at the site to ascertain the extent of the pollution, pump the floating cyclohexane, vent gas and conduct analyses. This work required special precautions to be taken to prevent any risk of explosion when drilling;&nbsp;- 2 bore holes to secure the cyclohexane were drilled with lowering of the water table (diameter 300 mm);&nbsp;- 1 sparging barrier 300 m long was set up at the northern limit of the site to reinforce the existing hydraulic barrier (injection of air into the water table and recovery of gas by 18 doubled bore holes);&nbsp;- 4 observation wells were drilled downstream of the site (in addition to the 3 existing);&nbsp;- several hundred cyclohexane analyses were conducted in the observation wells (on site and downstream) by an external laboratory (detection limit 5 µg/l for a potability limit of 10 µg/l). This work enabled the extent of the pollution to be limited. At the end of August 2003 the spill extended beneath the industrial site over an area 600 m long and 300 m wide. The thickness of the floating cyclohexane varied from a few centimetres to a dozen centimetres. At the end of August 2003, 480 t of cyclohexane had been extracted from the subsoil (more than 90 % of it in floating form), by means of the 3 recovery systems in place: skimming the floating layer, venting and sparging. Investigations were conducted on biological treatment of the pollution using bacteria, specifically to denature cyclohexane, detected at the periphery of the polluted area. The authorities acted as follows: &nbsp;- Monitoring and ascertaining the facts,&nbsp;- conducting 5 inspections, on 8 January, 7 March, 13 June, 2 and 3 July 2003;&nbsp;- proposing 2 emergency orders by the Prefect on 9 January 2003 (circumstances of the leak, pollution control, surveillance, feedback, information for the authorities) and 12 March 2003 (boosting pumping, downstream surveillance, independent expert assessment);&nbsp;- organising 7 meetings with the operator (including 3 on information for the authorities);&nbsp;- compiling several dozen reports, statements and letters to the Prefect and the operator as well as to elected representatives, environmental protection associations, the courts and media.A workgroup made up of the DRIRE, DDASS, DDAF and DIREN was specially formed to monitor and assess the consequences of the leak and suggest to the Prefect any necessary protective measures to be imposed relative to safety and public health. The workgroup concentrated mainly on:&nbsp;- the operator checking the effectiveness of the hydraulic barrier in place, so as to contain the pollution within the industrial site and prevent any downstream contamination;&nbsp;- recovering the cyclohexane;- monitoring the water table downstream of the chemicals plant.","Various actions aimed at preventing a repetition of any such leak were implemented:1) On the cyclohexane branch pipe that leaked:&nbsp;- installation of flow measurement on all cyclohexane lines with relaying to the Olone control room (materials report displayed with alarms), &nbsp;- drafting of instructions in the event of non-use of the line (closure of the admission valve, draining down);&nbsp;- annual inspection of the steam heating system;&nbsp;- regular check on the condition of piping in the pipeway;&nbsp;- assumption of a leak as soon as a fault is detected (information for staff + instructions).2) On the site's other pipework carrying dangerous fluids:&nbsp;- procedure for allocating responsibilities between the different units on the site;&nbsp;- 67 programmed modifications to dangerous fluid transfer lines;&nbsp;- specification of methods of inspection and maintenance on operation of the steam heating system.A procedure for informing the authorities in the event of an incident was drafted jointly with the Prefecture. It has been tested since early 2003. This procedure includes in particular a rating of the incident established by means of a table covering the nature of the chemical (toxic, flammable, #), the size of the leak, the impact on the site and off the site. A separate rating assesses the potential impact on the basis of the volume of the system (potential leakage), the controllability of the event, the operability of safety systems, the potential impact on the site and off the site, quantifying damage and business interruption. The information is sent to national authorities (CODIS, Prefecture, Police, DRIRE, labour inspectorate, CRAM, emergency services) and to local authorities. The application of this procedure resulted in the company reporting 16 incidents between January and November 2003.The Chalampé chemicals plant has become the pilot site in the company's group for information for the authorities. The leak revealed:&nbsp;- technical malfunctions: failure of the steam heating system, absence of information in real time (materials assessment) and alarm enabling the leak to be detected;&nbsp;- the absence of inspection programmes covering the equipment involved (branch pipes, steam heating system, #) and the actual appointment of people responsible for the inspections;&nbsp;- the absence of suitable instructions in the event of a leak;&nbsp;- communication problems between the three departments involved;&nbsp;- the presence of an unused, large dimension branch pipe without retention because the DN50 mm branch pipe admission valve is kept open;&nbsp;- inappropriate reactions by operatives due to the aforementioned technical and organisational shortcomings and the absence of diagnostic support systems in the event of an alarm going off;&nbsp;- incomplete information on the incident.The leak enabled:&nbsp;- the effectiveness of the hydraulic barrier to be confirmed (set up in the nineteen eighties following pollution of communes' potable water sources due to the chemicals plant);&nbsp;- action programmes to be upgraded and launched to prevent a further substantial leak;&nbsp;- information to the authorities and adjoining communes to be rethought;&nbsp;- the plant to be reminded of its duty of care and of the control of processes and the risks presented by its facilities;&nbsp;- expertise and experience to be quickly assembled in the various departments tasked with public health, protection of the environment, the water authority and classified facilities authority through the workgroup."

103,414,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Explosive fire in the melt shop - oxigen line - of a steelworks factory,2003-09-19 11:00:00,2003-09-19 11:30:00,"An explosive fire took place in the melt shop of a factory in Tornio.&nbsp; A main valve of oxygen gas pipeline broke at Avesta Polarit's Tornio melt shop line number 2 on the 19th of September 2003. The accident caused an explosive fire, which was extinguished within half an hour. The accident took the lives of three peoples.&nbsp; No-one was injured. The melt shop was in an annual maintenance shutdown and control work was being done on valves on the oxygen distribution pipeline. Main pipeline runs from the exterior of the building to the melt shop. The back-pressure valves had been changed and the testing of the system was starting up. The accident investigation has been carried out by the national Accident Investigation Board and TUKES. Accident Case HistoryA fierce fire costing the lives of three workers took place at the Tornio (Finland) steelworks of AvestaPolarit Stainless Oy on September 19, 2003. The accident site was the melting shop of the steelworks. The melting shop line number 2 that had been built the previous year was in its first annual maintenance shutdown. During the shutdown back pressure valves were to be installed to pipelines conveying the so called raw oxygen and pure oxygen. Therefore they had been closed and made purged by air. Most of the work had already been completed, and the foreman of the factory and the foreman of the subcontractor started preparing thestart-up of the oxygen systems.The men entered the valve room on the third floor of the melting house, where they successfully opened the main shut valve of the raw oxygen line. Thereafter they started opening the main shut valve of the oxygen line. The valve was apparently stuck, because the bolt pin holding the hand wheel in the valve stem snapped. The men asked for pipe tongs, with the help of which they started turning the valve hand wheel stem. They managed to turn the stem about one turn, corresponding to a 9° turn of the disc. At that moment an explosive fire broke out. It kept burning fiercely as the oxygen was leaking from the damaged piping. Both the foremen that had been opening the valve and a welder who had come to the scene by chance were killed.Judging by the burn marks the fire started from the oxygen line main shut valve; a butterfly valve with a nominal diameter of 300 mm. Gaseous oxygen compressed to a pressure of 35 bar was flowing in the pipes. There was a by-pass line beside the valve. Due to safety reasons this line was supposed to be used to equalize the pressure on both sides of the main shut valve before opening the latter. After the accident the by-pass valve was found to be in a closed position, although no specific information about the use of the by-pass line was found in the investigation. Whether or not the by-pass line was used will have affected the cause of the fire.","On the basis of the investigation the fire may have ignited in three different ways:1) The slide bearings of the valve disc stem may have been damaged, and two steel surfaces may have come into contact in the damaged area. When the valve was being opened, these two surfaces may have become hot by the friction and set fire to the plastic bearing material which ignites more easily than steel.2) The valve may have been opened without equalising the pressure. In this case the dust particles from pipeline in the fast oxygen flow of the valve gap would have struck valve parts, become hot, and ignited the valve to burn in the oxygen. 3) A foreign object may have got stuck in the valve and formed a friction pair that caused friction heating when the valve was being opened. The third option is possible even though the by-pass line had been used, but the first two necessitate the opening of the valve without equalising the pressure.","Three workers died in the accident. One of the fatalities was the foreman of the factory, one the foreman of the subcontractor and third fatality was a subcontractors welder, who had come to the scene just before the accident. They were killed immediately.The fire was extinguished relatively quickly as the flow of oxygen was closed down and the fire brigade commenced fire-fighting activities. The success of fire damage limitation was due to fire containment compartments and non-flammable roof structures. Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","The factory's own fire-brigade, the municipal fire brigade of the city and municipal fire-brigade from a neighbouring city in Sweden. Official action taken - other official action: The company had to provide clarification in the three following phases for the Safety Technology Authority of Finland (TUKES):1) Clarification of the immediate actions which the company has taken to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future (1.10.2004). The clarification had to pay particular attention to the operational safety of oxygen valves and pipelines.2) In the second phase (31.1.2005) the establishment had to provide clarification for TUKES on how it has improved the contents and scope of instructions concerning the operation and maintenance of oxygen equipment and how the company will ensure functionality and compliance with the instructions. In this clarification the company had to describe the procedures by which the personnel's knowledge of risk and working methods would be improved. In addition, widespread competence and expertise in the case of oxygen system changes had to be described.3) When the safety report is next updated, the company should identify and present possible accident scenarios pertaining to the oxygen system. The extent and severity of the consequences should also be described as well as the protective measures and intervention required to limit these consequences.","Measures to prevent recurrence: In order to prevent similar accidents the accident investigation group set up by the Safety Technology Authority (TUKES) made the following suggestions: 1.Skills, commitment and responsibility related to dangerous substances and safety should be emphasised and effectively developed.&nbsp; 2.Safety of valves used in oxygen systems should be confirmed as correct and in good working order. When making alterations or modifications, dependable equipment suppliers must be used. The company should define design and safety requirements for the oxygen systems and in addition, design instructions which should be observed in the design of oxygen systems. &nbsp;3.Clear and extensive written instructions for the use, control and maintenance of the pipelines must be made, and they have to be available to anyone needing them. Any deviations from normal operations should be reported and dealt with in detail.&nbsp; 4.When oxygen lines are put into operation, purity of the pipeline surfaces exposed to the oxygen atmosphere is an absolute prerequisite, which must be adhered to at all phases of construction and installation. The minimum amount of cleaning, inspection and testing procedures to be carried out on the oxygen systems shall be defined in writing.&nbsp; "

After the reaction had been completed, the vessel (which was located on a lower floor) was to be flushed out using ethanol decanted from a 8,000 litres reactor. The control room operator, aware that the contents of the larger vessel would not fit into the 4,000 litres vessel, instructed the local operator to check the decanting operation into the lower vessel. The operator manually checked the level in the 4,000 litres reactor a number of times. During the last inspection, he observed that the smaller reactor was full. He closed the man-hole and the heating started. After a certain period of time, the control room operator discovered that the temperature of the reactor's contents was 87°C, well above the pre-set level of 70°C. He shut off the reactor's jacket steam but shortly afterwards the fire alarm in the area and the sprinkler system was activated. An investigation of the scene showed that the sprinkler system was activated and an area around the reactor's man-hole was blackened as a result of a flash fire. The flash fire was extinguished by the sprinkler system. As no one was in the area when the accident occurred, no one was injured.","CAUSES:Post-accident investigations carried out by the company showed that the temperature control loop failed allowing the temperature rise to 87°C instead of 70°C required (the output of the automatic control failed to update the control valve position even though it was correctly set). The reactor's man-hole clamps were not fully tightened and ethanol vapours must have been emitted from an overfull reactor. An examination of the contents of the 8,000 litres reactor after the accident showed that the smaller reactor was slightly overfilled. The most probable source of ignition was the pyrophoric Nickel material forced out of the reactor by the boiling ethanol through the partially closed man-hole. The investigation revealed that all electrical equipments in the area were correctly functioning.",MATERIAL LOSS:The cost of the damage caused by the flash fire to the electrical cables around the reactor has been evaluated in about 0.0013 M Euros.People - Remarks: When the accident occurred no one was in the area and so no one was injured by the flash fire.Affected Area: installation,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire at the reactor man-hole activated a sprinkler head located above the vessel. It resulted in the fire alarm and the activation of the sprinkler system. By the time the supervisor arrived on the scene (2 minutes later) the fire was extinguished by the sprinkler system. The company fire crew was activated but its intervention was not necessary.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:No off-site emergency measures were necessary.No emergency measures are still required, niether  on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the Industrial Inspectorate required the company to:
1- repair the faulty temperature control loop;
2- provide for the post-campaign flush-out batch sheet to give a warning of potential overfilling of the reactor;
3- introduce proper man-hole cover bolting practices;
4- ensure that control room attendants carefully review all non-standard operations with local operators;

107,297,Major Accident,"Ceramics (bricks, pottery, glass, cement, etc.)",Major release of waste oil to ground and sea caused by defect drain valve on 8000 m3 waste oil tank,2001-01-14 00:00:00,2001-01-31 00:00:00,"Accidental discharge of a dangerous substance involving a quantity of more than 5 % of the qualifying quantity as laid down in column 3 of Annex 1. 
The release from the large waste oil tank started through a defective valve. Initially, the safety basin captured the total amount of fluid. However, partially open drain valves,  unfinished repair work on the basin and a number of cracks in the walls allowed some of the released amount to spread further into the ground and to the sea.
","The preliminary analysis indicates that the immediate cause of the accident was a defective drain valve on the 8,000 m3 tank.","On site effects: Contaminated soil

Off site effects: High levels of heavy metals and hydrocarbons measured in the sea outside the docks. 300 meters of gravel beach was contaminated in the tidal zone. The preliminary analysis shows minor  effects on biological life in the area. This might be due to the extremely cold weather at the time of the accident. Most of the oil was removed before the growing season started.
","On site emergency measures:&nbsp; Oil booms (600 meters) were placed in three barriers surrounding the bay outside the plant to prevent further spreading of the oil. Heavy ice floes also helped in keeping the oil within a limited area. Most of the oil was collected using sludge suction trucks and oil skimmers. In addition, absorption booms were used to collect thin films of oil and to prevent more oil to spread into the water. Large amounts of contaminated soil has been removed and replaced. Restoration work is still being undertaken at the site at the time of reporting. Off site emergency measures: Some lightly contaminated soil on the beach was removed. A nearby private harbour was cleaned including the boats. ",The Company has experienced the usefulness of having a thorough environmental risk analysis. Here it is important to evaluate environmental information both on the probability of an accident and on the consequences thereof. Valuable experience was also gained for response actions during winter conditions onshore and offshore.

To reduce the effects of the naphtha evaporation, that was cooling the tank to -4°C, foam was applied on the liquid surface. By mistake, the foam was applied into the middle of the tank surface (instead than on the border) and the static charges ignited the naphtha vapours. The ignition resulted in a progressive burning of vapours spreading over the surface of the tank. The fire was extinguished in 3 hours.","Due to a maloperation in the feeding line (code 5501), the floating roof of a storage tank sunk when it jammed (snow loading may also has been a factor) [code 5101 and 5201]. In order to reduce the naphtha evaporation, foam was applied but, due to training/instructions (code 5304) and emergency procedures inadequate (code 5303), the operator made a mistake (code 5401) and the jet of foam was applied in middle of tank and static charges (code 5109) ignited vapours above the liquid surface.",MATERIAL LOSS:The floating roof of the storage tank was destroyed. No data are available about the cost of the destroyed floating roof tank.People - Remarks: Between 1 and 50 rescue personnel were mobilized. No people were affected by the fire.Disruption of community life: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant effects outside the establishment (the thermal radiation produced by fire was confined on-site).Affected Area: installation,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The on-site emergency plan was activated and the fire was fought by the refinery and by the county fire services (between 1 and 50 rescue personnel were mobilized). Foam was applied to the liquid surface to reduce the evaporation of the naphta.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The county fire services were called to extinguish the fire but the full off-site emergency plan was not activated.No on-site emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- revision of procedures and training on static charges;

VCM is maintained in liquid state by applying a higher pressure than ambient pressure. If VCM in liquid state is released into the atmosphere, because its boiling point is -13°C, the VCM partly vaporises into a cloud which can cause cold burns on the skin.During the emergency response operation, while the worker was trying to isolate the failed filter by closing a manual valve downhill of the filter, the worker suffered a slight cold burn on his forearm caused by the contact with the handle of the manually operated valve, which was covered with ice due to the VCM release. The worker went to the onsite sanitary service for medical attention after alarm was called off.During emergency operations, another worker suffered from a temporary sensitisation of the hand while opening the valve of the gas release system, the symptoms disappeared without any medical treatment. The accident did not cause any off-site consequences.Area concerned:The environmental monitoring system of department CV24-25 is equipped with 52 gas sampling probes, the system analyses the presence of VCM (vinyl chloride monomer), ECF (ethyl chloroformate) and DCE (di-chloro-ethane), this has allowed to detect the VCM release in the area affected and the evolution of the VCM concentrations.The streams extracted by each sampling probe is sent to a mass spectrograph to determine the concentrations, the systems allows to detect concentrations from 0 to 100 ppm.The VCM monitoring is performed each 17 minutes, between each extraction of air samples by the sampling probes and the successive extraction, the analysis sequence is not numeric. The VCM release point is located inside a shed with three walls, partially opened to the exterior. The filter is located on a second floor some 8-10 m from the ground. On the ground floor are located polymerisation lines A and B constituted by a total of 14 reactors.The records of the values measured by each probe the day of the event (annex 4), show that during an extended period of time inside the shed. VCM concentrations reached values of more than 100 ppm (above the measurement limit of the instruments), probably due to the fact that the shed is only partially opened.In the polymerisation area a value above instrument measurement limit was measured at 7.51.38 by probe 30 (bottom of reactors 7 and 8) while probe Nr. 19 (comb of reactor 14) measured values above 100 ppm. also after 9.30 hrs. Probe Nr. 36 located near the release point registered VCM concentrations in the air above 100 ppm. Untill approx. 10.15. After that hour there are no records of VCM concentrations measured by the probes above 100 ppm.Also outside the polymerisation area there are some probes which registered VCM concentrations above 100 ppm: in particular probes 6 and 63 registered concentration peaks of VCM respectively at 8.15.14 and 8.09.06 in correspondence of road F located south- west from the release point, the measured values descended to 10 ppm respectively at&nbsp; 8.49.59 and 8.27.00.The probe located the farthest from the release point measured relevant concentrations of VCM, probe Nr. 61, located in correspondence to the gasholder some 120 m from the release point, measured a VCM concentration of 74.34 ppm. at 8.07.47 hrs, while the foregoing measurement and the successive one registered just CVM concentrations below 1 ppm.Also probe Nr. 44 inside the control room detected a VCM concentration of 93.28 ppm at 8.11.42 and then progressively decreasing values until values below 1 ppm.Ineos Vinyl has employed a mobile vehicle to monitor the VCM concentrations in the areas outside of the departments (annex 5 page 20)The mobile vehicle performed 28 progressive measurements at 12 minutes interval in relation to 9 different positions, of which 8 were inside a perimeter of 500 metres from the department and one measurement point was located between 00 and 1000 m from the department. The values measured by the mobile vehicle were in the range of a few ppm while inside the department the values measured were above 100 ppm.The position nearest to the city, monitored by the mobile vehicle, was position Nr. 7, the values were of 0,19 ppm and 0,8 ppm measured respectively at 11.34 and 11.46.People - Remarks:When the event occurred the shift personnel present insite was composed by:Shift personnel Position1 shift assistant in the office building3 switchboard operators in the control room1 external reactor operator in the control room1 external services operator in the control room1 external drying process operator in the office of the shift assistantThe day shift personnel starts work at 8:00 hrs.

Self protective equipment with facial mask and specific AX filter or ABEK filter (annex 5 page 7)The company has presented a technical consultancy report on the impact of the VCM release made by Doct. Tommaso A. Dragani in which it is stated that: ""The VCM release on 6/07/2006 never constituted a health hazard"".During the emergency response operation a worker, while trying to isolate the failed filter by closing a manual valve downhill of the filter, suffered a slight cold burn on his forearm caused by the contact with the handle of the manually operated valve, which was covered with ice due to the VCM release. The worker went to the onsite sanitary service for medical attention after alarm was called off.During emergency operations, another worker suffered from a temporary sensitisation of one hand while opening the valve of the gas relief system, the symptoms disappeared without any medical treatment. There are no known offsite consequences to persons or known offsite material damage.Ecological Harm - Remarks:On 06/07/2006 at 14.07 hrs a water samples were taken from the sewage water discharged into the public sewage system at point SM2. The analysis made by the Societa Servizi Porto Marghera (SPM) indicates a concentration of 22,4 g/l of VCM, with respect to the threshold limit of 50 g/l.Test report 2006/5852 on a former test sample taken at 8:20 indicates a VCM concentration of 3.1 g/l.","ON SITEAccordino to environmental monitoring system equipped with VCM detectors (annex 4) at 7.51.38 sensor Nr. 30,positioned near reactors 7 and 8 detected the presence of VCM, indicating a value of &gt; 100 ppm (upper measurement limit). It is observed that detector Nr. 36, located a few m from the release point did not detect any VCM at 7.50.17, it is concluded therefore that the CSM release occurred between 7.50.17 hrs and 7.51.38 hrs.Analysing the data provided by the plant operator concerning the VCM detectors and the data obtained from the Distributed Control System (DCS), like the data registered by detector FI900 (mass flow meter) or PI906 ( pressure sensor of feeding line B) there is a discrepancy with the indicated timing.The operator declared (pag 5 annex 5) that the time indicated in the DCS is always 7 minutes and 29 seconds later than the time indicated by the sensors.The shift assistant was informed immediately over the phone by the personnel in the control room, that the sensor system indicated the presence of VCM onsite, he came directly into the control room. Also the operative assistant came into the control room, after he was informed via intercommunication system and had ordered the entire personnel to go to the emergency gathering points foreseen by the onsite emergency response plan.The external reactor assistant, equipped with self-respirator and a portable VCM-meter went to check the detector which triggered alarm. Successively also the shift assistant went to the release area equipped with self-respirator and reached the filter P24123/B almost contemporarily with the external assistant, there they both noticed that the filter was releasing two phase VCM from the flanged coupling in correspondence of the filter cap.According to the reconstruction made by the operator the timing was the following:7.52 signal from the mass spectrometer7.54reactor assistants goes to the release point7.55 the shift foreman goes to the release point7.58 Closure of the manual valve upstream of the filter7.58 Closure of the valve downstream of the filter8.00&nbsp; Start of gas relief operation8.03 shut off operation of the valve downstream of the filter completed and connection of the filter with the gas relief line and pressure relief.8.04 Alerting of the Operative Centre for Emergency Response of the industrial pole.The company alerted the Operative Centre for Emergency Response of the industrial pole (pag. 7 annex 5) by dialling 3333, requesting the assistance of an emergency response team to set up water curtains in order to avoid the dispersion of VCM and to abate the VCM in the area affected by the release. Afterwards the shift technician informed the fire department in Porto Marghera about the event and informed via FAX the authorities, on the starting and ending time of the emergency, as foreseen by the communication procedure of the company.The operator ordered, consequent to the event, all department personnel not involved in the emergency response to reach the gathering points, as foreseen by the on-site emergency response plan. At 9.15 hrs the operator called off the emergency and normal vehicle circulation conditions around the department and the access to the department were re-established.OFF SITEThe accident did not trigger the offsite emergency response plan, nor the alarm sirens placed on acoustic poles in the city of Marghera were activated to alert the population.Emergency measures - Remarks: At 8.04 hrs INEOS requested the intervention of the Operative Emergency Response Centre of the chemical pole. The emergency alert was passed to the fire brigade of the pole located 300-400 m from the accident place. the fire brigades of the company Servizi Porto Marghera intervened and took measures for the precautionary containment of the VCM by the means of water curtains. They installed the water curtains using the water distribution system of the department and specific equipment they brought. The shift technician of SPM (Servizi Porto Marghera) called the security service of the chemical pole, in accordance with the emergency response procedures of the establishment, to control the vehicle movement inside the establishment and the access to the establishment itself, the shift technician also activated the message transmission system of the Site Integrated Emergency Management System.The Integrated Emergency Management System of the Site sent three messages concerning the evolution of the event.Time of the message8.17 PIE team in CV24 to check VCM release from the coupled flange of filter to reactors8.18 CV24: release stopped, circuit aspiring, teams assisting8.34 CV24: event ended, plant in safe conditionThe alarm in the department does not represent an emergency situation for the Integrated Emergency Management System.In the report of INEOS dated 12/07/2006 (annex 5) it is stated that, apart from isolating the leaking filter the personnel responding to the emergency took the necessary measures to transfer the VCM from the filter to the abatement system.During the operation the technicians detected the persistence of the release from the failed filter gasket, due to an incomplete emptying of the filter itself. They substituted the failed gasket at 9.40 to assure the complete safety of the area affected.Official action taken - legal action:&nbsp;a)legal action
The competent Attorney General's Office of Venice opened a proceeding to evaluate the responsibility of the company with regards to the accident.
Following a joint inspection of ARPA Venice and the public fire department of Venice (annex 14) a preliminary report has been issued.

Official action taken - other official action: b) other official action
The Occupational Health and Safety Service of the Local Socio Sanitary Unit NR. 12 (Venice) prescribed according to art 20 of legislative decree 758/94 following measures to limit the consequences of similar accidents.
The Occupational Health and Safety Service prescribed refurbishment and improvement measures for the pressurisation and conditioning system of the control room of plant CV24/25, and the installation of adequate sanitary services apt to be used in case of accidental exposition to VCM of a worker.

Discussion about response: Concerning the notification of the accident to the European Commission  according to paragraph I.1 of Anex VI of legislative decree 334/99:
The occurrence has to be notified to the Commission as accidental release, if the assumption that 4000 kg of VCM were effectively released as measured by the flow-meter is considered credible; as the quantity corresponds to more than 5% of the threshold quantity for extremely flammable substances which is fixed for the application of art. 8 b - legislative decree 334/99 in 50 tons.

The company used a generic procedure for the substitution of PTFE gaskets on RF type flanges (annex 13).** The company has performed an investigation on accidents, near misses and non conformities (registration Nr. 120/06) in the context of the Safety Management System, the report states that the fundamental elements of the SGS in play during an emergency are the operative control and the emergency planning.*** The emergency response procedure in case of VCM release foresees the remote shut off of the root valves. It is pointed out that the workers have closed the remote control root valves once they closed manually the isolating valves of the filter which was not foreseen by the emergency response procedure.Concerning the compliance with art 21 of legislative Decree 334/99 with respect to the Safety Report and to art. 25 of legislative Decree 334/99 with respect to the SMS assessment, the approval procedure of the safety Report presented in 2000 had been concluded while the approval process of the safety Report presented in 200 is still undergoing.The last assessment of the SMS made with the commission named by the Environmental ministry was concluded in 2002.","Measures to prevent recurrence:&nbsp; a) measures to prevent recurrenceThe company declared that (annex 2):- the accident was caused by the failure of the sealing gasket of the cap of filter P24123/B installed on the reactor feeding line B. Possible causes of the accident:1. defective sealing surfaces (non planar surfaces, dirty surfaces)2. faulty tightening of the bolts after substitution of the candle filters3. failure of the gasket employedDue to the fact that it is not possible to identify one single accident cause it has been decided to take preventive measures concerning all 3 potential accident causes described above:1) refurbishment of all 4 filters P24123/A-B e P24104/B-C. The operator has provided to grind all gasket seats of the flanges and of the candle filter bearing plate, although the inspection and tests performed on the filter did not show any defects on the sealing surfaces, this operation was performed under the supervision of ARPA Venice.2) The tightening torque for the bolts of the flanged coupling was calculated and a procedure and regulation for the closure of filters P24123/A-B e P24104/B-C was established.3) Modification have been performed on the equipment in order to minimise from the source pressure variations during the VCM charging process of the reactors.4) The emergency response procedures of the department have been revised concerning the response to similar accidents. The personnel of the department has been trained concerning the emergency response and how to isolate the VCM lines in case of VCM release.5 A study on the possibility to install a double sealing system on the filter cover is foreseen.6) Compliance with the measures prescribed by the Occupational Health and Safety ServiceMeasures to mitigate consequences: b) measures to mitigate consequencesAfter the integrated emergency response system of the establishment triggered alarm, the fire brigades of the company Servizi Porto Marghera (SPM) intervened to and took measures for the precautionary containment of the VCM by the means of water curtains.

The force of the explosion destroyed the block wall separating the transfer facility from the compressor room, ripped away stairs from the staircase leading to the mezzanine and destroyed 200 m2 of fibre-cement roof sheets. Bottle fragments were projected more than 100 m (300 m according to the firemen), with one piece flying all the way to another company 500 m away.","Initial investigations show that the explosion probably took place during a transfer operation from a source bottle with a volume of 40 l and a capacity of 39 kg, manufactured over 50 years ago and issued from a stock of old bottles recovered on the site. It did not show up in the tracking system set up 10 years before the accident. The target bottle, with a volume of 40 l and a capacity of 50 kg, had been manufactured 2 years before the accident. It is probably the target bottle that exploded and its fragments perforated the source bottle and a dozen other bottles that were in the facility. Traces of calcination (soot deposits on the damaged bottles and on the transfer manometer) and a cloud of black smoke seen by another worker appear to indicate that an exothermal reaction caused the explosion of the target bottle.

119,48,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Leak of phenol to the municipal sewer,2008-01-05 00:00:00,2008-01-08 00:00:00,"On Saturday January 5th 2008 a production operator discovered a fair-sized phenol leak in the phenol pump house next to the phenol storage tank. One of the gaskets on the flange connection on the outlet pipe of the tank had failed. The head of the operations department tried to stop the leak by tying a rubber belt around the flanges. In the meantime, an operator sprayed lots of water on the flange to avoid contact with phenol as much as possible.The phenol that had leaked was collected in the catchment pit of 20 m# underneath the pump house. Afterwards the spray water was added to it. This catchment pit had a high level alarm, but that was not functioning at the time of the leak. The malfunctioning was not known by the company at that time because the alarm wasn't inspected periodically. An attempt was made to close the only manual valve on the pipe, located between the inner and the outer tank shells. But the valve broke off during this manipulation. So the line couldn't be shut off. After the temporary repair of the flange connection, three trickles of phenol kept on spraying, which were also collected in the catchment tank. It wasn't allowed for the employees to enter the pump house for as long as the phenol was leaking.To clean up the catchment pit, the company disposes of a waste tank, which is big enough to contain all leaked and leaking phenol. When starting to pump the phenol from the catchment tank to the waste tank, it was discovered that the catchment pit did overflow. Part of the phenol/water mixture had flown over the rim of the open pit into the municipal sewer system. At the time, it was not yet known how much phenol had leaked to the sewer system.On Monday January 7th 2008 it was decided to start up the phenol based batch production to consume all phenol in the storage tank as the phenol tank had to be taken out of service in order to replace the gasket on the flange. On Tuesday January 8th, after a few batch productions, it was found out that the level indicator in the phenol storage tank got stuck since the last control of the level on Friday 4th (comparison of manual level measurement with level indicator). Only at that moment the company realised how much phenol had leaked out of the tank: about 25 tonnes! Most of it should have been collected in the catchment pit, so it was recuperated. But a part of the phenol, more than 5 tonnes, got in the municipal sewer. As far as is known, there was no external damage reported.A specialised company came on site to repair the (remaining) phenol leak with a temporary, but solid solution. Afterwards, when the flanges and valves were replaced, it was found out that the valve broke down because the gasket next to it had been reacting with phenol during many years, leading to a solid deformation preventing the valve to move.","Degradation of gasket.
Failure to implement a successful inspection and maintenance programme.Summary of what went wrong: - The gasket of the flange was leaking. This wasn't noticed immediately. This gasket had been installed about 18 years ago, when the tank was built. This gasket wasn't (full) phenolproof. - The manual valve at the tank broke off as a result of the deformation of the adjacent gaskets. Since the day the phenol tank was taken into service, this valve had never been closed or inspected.- The automatic activation of the submerged pump by a level switch in the catchment tank didn't function. This level switch had never been tested in the past.- The level indicator in the phenol tank didn't function anymore. This malfunctioning can only be a recent fact because of the frequent control of the indicator. A few days before the incident the indicator was still working properly.","25 ton of phenol in catchment pit
of which 5 ton overflowed in the public sewer.Affected Area: installation&nbsp;",Only leak repair,"Lessons learned:- Set up a risk based inspection system. During earlier visits Seveso inspectors diagnosed a insufficient inspection system. Although some work was already done to select a better system, by the time of the phenol leak, this new inspection system wasn't completely in place yet.- Replace the gaskets more frequently. The used gasket was a ""Vitton"" gasket. According to the supplier data, Vitton gaskets are phenol-resistant, but the facts prove that after many years the gaskets aren't phenolproof anymore.- Better design of the manual valve (outside of the cup tank instead of between the 2 shells).- Better working procedures (closing the manual valve after each run of phenol based production batches or at the end of the working week)"

Nothing unusual was observed. The last time the storage room of FAS was visited before the accident was in the morning of Friday, 11th of October.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Wind direction North-East. Wind speed = about 5 m/s.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:On Friday, 11th of October 1991 at 14:15, about 22.7 tonnes of formamidine sulfinic acid (FAS) decomposed almost instantaneously producing a thick white fog of sulphur dioxide and a solid residue. The sulphur dioxide cloud disappeared at approximately 16:15. An open fire did not developed. The maximum temperature reached during the decomposition has not been very high because the wooden pallets on which the FAS big- bags were stored were not burnt or discoloured.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The initiating event is not fully known. A smell in the warehouse was felt for some time prior to the accident. FAS decomposed to Sulphur dioxide escaping the building. The solid residue flowed out of the building.CAUSES:The likely cause was storage mistakes, which caused chemical reactions between the stored chemicals. These reactions were exothermic and initiated the fast decomposition of FAS. The exothermic reactions took probably place between the bags of FAS and the bags of alkaline soap. Alkaline dust from sodium carbonate, which was sprinkled on the floor to give a driving support for trucks, may also have been involved in the reaction, and condensed water may have been accelerated the reactions. The storage of FAS in two layers may have accelerated the rate of decomposition, as it reduced the heat&nbsp; transfer from the bags.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:12 people inside and 19 outside the establishment were injured by the release of sulphur dioxide. All of them were hospitalized.MATERIAL LOSS:No material losses occurred except the decomposed product (about 22.7 tonnes of FAS) and other chemicals that were damaged. The cost of the lost products has been evaluated in about 1 million DKR (about 0.12 MECU).ECOLOGICAL HARM:Sulphur dioxide was released from Maglemoelle Papirfabrik into the neighbourhood, a part of the town Naestved. The residue (melted FAS, sulphur, urea and other decomposition products) flowed into the harbour. The local environmental authority observed the harbour on the day of the accident and two days later.

121,598,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion for overpressirisation in a glass lined storage tank containing  recirculated acid solution used to absorb ammonia in a phtalocyamines process unit,1991-02-21 18:00:00,1991-02-21 00:00:00,"The accident occurred in one of the two glass lined storage tanks, 35 m3 capacity each, holding the recirculated acid solution (about 29% of sulphuric acid) used to absorb the residual ammonia from the gaseous effluents of the phtalocyamines process unit. This solution was enriched with ammonium carbonate coming from the ammonia treatment unit. The pH of the solution was manually controlled once per shift and adjusted if necessary by adding sulphuric acid solution so that the pH was maintained within the slightly acidic range (5 to 6). The solution's pH was periodically checked (every 8 hours) by an operator. When the accident occurred, the operator realized too late that the ammonium sulphate and ammonium carbonate solution was became basic and suddenly added a 60% sulphuric acid solution to it. This resulted in an abnormal production of carbon dioxide that overpressurized the tank which exploded because of inadequate pressure relieving capacity (the hydraulic trap with which the tank was equipped was not sufficient to withstand the peak pressure generated). The collapse of the tank caused the release of the solution (about 20 m3), which was partially recovered in the containment basin of the 2 glass lined tanks and partially in the yard. The rest of the solution was collected, through the sewer network, in the emergency basin of ACNA. All plants (except power plant and the oleum production plant) were shut-down in order to reduce the amount of effluents to the sewer network. This allowed the depuration of the ammonia solution released from the exploded tank and accumulated in the emergency basin avoiding, therefore, the pollution of the Bormida river. Samples taken from the river and analyzed by the local environmental authority laboratory (PMP of the U.S.L. No 7 of City of Savona) confirmed that the amount of solution spilled caused no environmental damage. Nobody was injured.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:

The collapse of the tank caused the release of the solution (about 20 m3).

CAUSES:
The accident was caused by an operator error that realized too late that the solution was became basic (the continuous pH monitoring was not foreseen) and added, by error again, a 60% sulphuric acid solution, resulting in an internal overpressurization of the tank due to the formation of carbon dioxide. Besides, the tank exploded because the pressure relieving capacity of the provided hydraulic trap was inadequate due to a wrong plant design.",MATERIAL LOSS:No data are available about the cost of the material losses that occurred (collapse of the glass lined storage tank and release of about 20 m3 of solution).ECOLOGIC HARM:Samples taken from the nearby Bormida river and analyzed by the local environmental authority laboratory (PMP of the U.S.L.

122,821,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion and large fire in the refinery flare system of a large oil refinery during maintenance to a leaking valve,1987-03-13 15:00:00,1987-03-13 00:00:00,"The ambient temperature was near freezing and this allowed significant liquid to condense out in the flare pipelines. Wind conditions were slight and the vapours from the spilling liquid were not dispersed. In early 1986 it was noted that the flare gas recovery system was operating at reduced efficiency. Gas which should have been recovered was being routed instead to flare. Investigation revealed that a 750 mm valve was passing gas when in closed position. A decision was taken to have the valve removed to carry out repairs to it. It was appreciated that there would require to be careful planning to prevent the possibility of leave refinery units being inadvertently isolated from the flare system. One of the flares would have to be taken out of service and therefore the potential flaring demand of the refinery would need to be matched to the remaining two flares. At a number of meetings of operational and maintenance staff, an agreed flare alignment procedure was drawn up outlining flare system conditions necessary for removal of the valve. The earliest time to carry out the work was to be in early 1987 when 2 of the refinery units and flare No 1 were planned to be out of service for routine maintenance. The detailed work methods and safety requirements concerned with the actual removal of the valve were not considered at the meeting. No difficulties were foreseen and the works were organized and arranged by operations department technicians. Few days prior the accident, the valves to isolate live parts of the flare system from the section under maintenance were closed. Immediately prior to work commencing, the BP technician checked the status of isolation valves and he also identify conditions in the isolated section by opening a small valve on the liquid drain line at a distant flare knockout drum. Finding no indication of gas or liquid coming from the valve he assumed that the flare line was isolated, depressurised and free of liquid. Near the work station were located 2 water monitors to disperse residual gas if it should flow out when the valve was removed. Two refinery fire-fighters were present to operate the monitors and to oversee the use of the breathing apparatuses being used by the workers as protection against potentially toxic residual gases in the flare line. Also in the work area there was a crane to lift the heavy valve and a diesel engine compressor to supply air for the breathing apparatuses. Being everything in order, the BP technician issued the permit to the contractor and work commenced. Two fitters and a rigger prepared to remove a flange ring spacer to insert a blank spade in its taken by a crane. Suddenly it pulled upwards and torrents of liquid gushed out to cascade down over the scaffold. Gases from the spilled liquid spread over the ground igniting on the engine of the air spread to cover the pool of liquid and envelop the scaffold and the men in a raging inferno.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:When a ring spacer was pulled free during the removal of a gate valve, torrents of petroleum spirits gushed out to cascade down to the ground below. The liquid was ignited by a nearby air compressor engine (used to supply air for the breathing apparatuses of the maintenance crew) and a pool fire occurred. The scaffold platform and the people on it were enveloped in flames.CAUSES:It soon became apparent that in the flare pipework scale had formed over the years. This scale had flaked off from internal surfaces to accumulate at the bottom of the flare pipelines where it turned into a thick viscous-sludge in the presence of vented and condensed hydrocarbon liquids. The sludge had found its way into the guides of flare line wedge gate valves which where thus prevented from closing fully. Sludge had also passed down liquid drain lines at the knock-out drums to cause them to block. Therefore the normal drainage built into the flare system no longer operated and as a result substantial quantities of liquid accumulated. The flare line isolation valves had no means of indicating their fully closed position. It was assumed that exerting considerable force on the handles of valves was sufficient indication. Many of the suppose closed valves were found to be jammed and were still allowing free passages of gas. The pipe to the valve used to test line conditions was also blocked with sludge. Therefore presence of liquids and gases in the line was not identified when the valve was open. Furthermore, the technician judged that residual flammable gases in the flare pipe presented no significant fire hazard. Therefore the system was not purged with inert nitrogen nor steam. In addition, the flare drainage was not verified as being clear of blockages nor the valves as being clear obstruction by the use of injected steam. Work methods have not been planned to take sufficient account of the risk of residual liquid being present in the flare.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:When the liquid was ignited, the scaffold platform and the people on it were engulfed in flames. Two people were killed and two others people were injured by fire.MATERIAL LOSS:The fire was readily confined to the work area and, therefore, damage was suffered only in its proximity (to pipelines, to electrical cables/equipments, to the crane and to the breathing air compressor). The cost of the material damages has been estimated in about 0.28 MECU.Disruption of community life: The usual response on receipt of an emergency call for a fire at the refinery was to commence off-site procedures. However, they were stood down within a short time as it became apparent that there would be no major hazard nor off-site risks (in the Original Report there is no evidence of significant effects outside the work area).Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The refinery fire brigade was called and quickly arrived on the scene to assist the two stand-by firefighters already fighting the fire. A few minutes later, units of the local fire brigade arrived. The fire was readily confined to the work area. To ensure that recovery of the bodies could be carried out in safety, all operating refinery units which could have continued in feeding into the flare system, were shut-down. Nitrogen gas purging of the flare lines was commenced.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The usual response on receipt of an emergency call for a fire at the refinery, was to commence off-site procedures. However, they were stood down within a short time as it became apparent that there would be no major hazard nor off-site risks.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence:&nbsp; After the accident, the following measures were established:1- any work on the refinery flare system has now to be authorised at senior management level. There is no formal requirement for the planning of work to take into account all potential risks. Work methods and safety precautions must be detailed in writing and agreed by representatives from a number of refinery departments who in turn will closely monitor work as it progresses;2- each valve should have an indication of its position and at the base of critical isolation valves have been added orifices to which steam can be injected to dissolve blockages;3- verify the performance of flare drainage;4- purge lines with inert nitrogen gas to clear residual flammable gases and to prevent air from reaching any pyrophoric scale inside the pipes;5- move flanges apart gradually with bolts still in position until the contents of the line can be positively identified;6- use trays under the flanges as they are moved apart to collect liquids in a safe way;7- avoid diesel-engine operated compressors nearby; at locations to which the refinery air system does not extend, mobile air storage tanks should be provided for breathing apparatuses.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- alternative escape routes from scaffold platforms or any work area must always be available;
2- staff on the work must be equipped with flash-fire suits;
3- remove personnel away when the final lift is carried out;
4- drench the valve removal area and scaffold platforms with ground-level fire monitors as the lift is carried out;
5- provide a refinery fire tender on stand-by at the scene."

At around 06:00, workers on the early shift established that the intake side of the extraction system had been damaged. A sizeable hole was found in the cable, the repair of which would be a major undertaking.&nbsp;
The extraction system is needed for the exhaust gases of the vacuum system and local exhaust ventilation, but is not directly technologically linked to each subsystem. It was decided to run the production line empty and turn off the system components as required (partial shutdown).&nbsp;
The last components in this technological circuitry of the multi-purpose facility are the belt filter and the screw conveyor, with a downstream dryer.The product is washed and drained (pre-dried) on the belt filter.At the end of this stage of the process, when it works as intended, the product still has a residual moisture content of approximately 25 to 30% of mass, at which level ignition is not to be expected.
The partial shutdown did not include the shutdown of the belt filter and the screw conveyor. The belt filter works with warm air. In the screw conveyor, friction in the bearings can generate hot spots.
Around 15:09, a muffled bang alerted facility staff to a malfunction in the facility. At 15:16 the control centre received an emergency callout for the factory fire brigade.The fire involved approximately 100 kg of dibutyltin oxide and 100 kg of dioctyltin oxide.A firefighter was injured in the course of the firefighting efforts (fracture of a middle finger).
Safety measures:The shift leader was informed and the factory fire brigade were alerted in accordance with the hazard prevention plan.","The expert is assuming that the dibutyltin oxide (DBTO) self-ignited in a funnel/feeding hopper or in the screw conveyor downstream.As a result of the frame construction with open floor grilles, the fire spread as far as the third floor. The ground floor fittings were damaged by the fire-fighting water.Self-ignition of the normally moist product, in the partially shutdown plant.","Extensive damage to the building and the facility. EUR 10,000,000 in damages.","

Atmospheric emissions of benzene measured on- site and off-site were thus generated, causing numerous complaints from neighbours. Although measurements made by the fire brigade in the inhabited areas of Carling and L'Hôpital were found to be negative (&lt;0.2 ppm), the sensors on the local air quality monitoring system measured values higher than 100 µg/m3 for 3½ hours (peaking at 506 µg/m3). The quantity of effluent released from the accident is assessed at 6,000 m3 and the quantity of benzene is assessed at nearly 5 t; the quantity of dangerous substances released lie more than 5% over the threshold defined by the Seveso Directive, which is why this accident is notified.","Heavy rain (16.4 mm of water, which is a rainstorm of an intensity with a recurrence of 4 years) caused several retention systems and some water / hydrocarbon settlement tanks to spill over as their overflows could not discharge into the site's stormwater catchment tank which was already full due to heavy rainfall in the days leading up to the accident.","The accident caused untreated water to be discharged directly into the Le Merle brook which carried excess COD (flow of 4,468 kg/d for 3,750 authorised), hydrocarbons (flow of 165 kg/d for 100 kg authorised) and benzene (flow of 84 kg/d or a concentration of 1.8 mg/l).Atmospheric emissions of benzene were also generated: measurements made by the fire brigade in inhabited areas showed a benzene concentration of less than 0.2 ppm (detection threshold) but the local air quality monitoring system between 7.15 and 10.45 a.m. measured concentrations of over 100 µg/m3 with a maximum measurement of 506 µg/m3. The nuisance caused by the smell&nbsp; resulted in 12 phone calls to the fire brigade from neighbours.","The floating barrage system incorporated in the water-based effluent treatment plant was deployed, enabling the hydrocarbons discharged to be limited.

At 2:55 pm, a power loss occurred and the generators took over. The maximum height of water reached at the lowest point of the site is of the order of one meter at the level of the southern zone of the site (peak of the flood the 02/06 at 8 am).","The peak of the SEINE river in Paris is equivalent to the peak of 1982 (6.10 m as against 6.18 m), but the floods of some of its tributaries have reached levels above 1910 (notably for LOING).
The origin of the rise of the waters is an exceptional level of precipitation over the month of May (the largest ever recorded), with, since the weekend of 28-29 May, a strong stormy period followed by several days of intense precipitation.
The flooding of the site was characterized by a rise of underground water with an overflow of the LOING.
Water then stagnated at the site. There was therefore no effect of current capable of carrying ice jams that could damage the installations.","No significant impact on the environment, nor human and social consequences are observed as a result of the flooding of the site. Finally, the operator did not detect aberrant signals (alarms, measured values, etc.) during the restarting of the installations.
The economic consequences are estimated at several million euros. Much of this is related to business losses. The material damage is comparatively lower.

Leak has led to an unstable pumping and outflow of hexane in the concrete channel. The channel has been established to collect the hexane in the event of leakage. There are no ignition sources in this channel. Concrete Canal ends at the building's outside wall between the pump and tank. Hexane could seep through the wall and formed a potentially explosive gas mixture in the room with pumps. It was not foreseen that hexane could penetrate the wall and the room was therefore not protected against explosion. The explosive was ignited by the electrical wiring in the room with pumps. An operator notices a faint smell of hexane and decides to find out why. 3 people are about to find the reason for the smell when the explosion happens. An employee who resides outside the building next to the room with pumps die. A fire arises and is extinguished by the fire brigade. The wave of pressure from the explosion partialley destroys the building together with the installation of electricity, pipes and tanks. The amount of hexane released is unknown. There is no environmental damage.      ",The accident happened due to corrosion of a relatively new concrete pipe and hence unstable pumping. The hexane has leaked into a channel made to collect any hexane leaking. The hexane was able to leak further through an outside wall and into an adjacent pump room. It was not considred possible that a hexane leak would access the pump room which was therefore not secure from ignition sources., One fatality, Firefighters, A concrete outer wall is not sufficient to stop hexane leaks from entering adjacent rooms. The separating wall between the room with hexane tanks and the pump room have since been reinforced with other materials that are inpenetrable from hexane.

The gas holder had 4 lifts and a total capacity of 170,000 m3. The site was unmanned during the silent hours but the volume at the holder was monitored by remote control from the Control Centre. The leak was caused by cracks in the fillet welds at the base of the vertical stay positions in the first lift cup. These had previously been repaired by the use of iron cement over the welds, probably at the time of construction. There was a release of natural gas over a period of 17 minutes. The escape took place above ground level as the gas holder dropped. Since natural gas is lighter than air, the main movement of the escaping gas would therefore be upwards. The gas cloud did not find an ignition source. The gas inflow to the holder and the gas outflow to the distribution system were stopped. By 08:00 am conditions at the site were back to normal. Theoretical, and also practical studies (involving an old gas holder), indicated that there was no chance of a gas flammable concentration outside the site boundaries.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The leak of natural gas was caused by cracks in the fillet welds at the base of the vertical stay positions in the first lift cup. These cracks allowed the failure of water seal and, consequently, the release of natural gas over a period of 17 minutes.

CAUSES:
The failure of water seal was caused by cracks in the fillet welds. The vertical stay positions in the first lift cup had previously been repaired by the use of iron cement over the welds, probably at the time of construction. The iron cement used to seal the cracks was not suitable to guarantee their isolation for a long period of time. No inspection of the gas holder has been foreseen to check the water seals.","MATERIAL LOSS:
No material losses occurred except the escaped natural gas.Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The Emergency procedures were activated and the emergency teams arrived on-site. The plant was shut-down and the gas holder isolated (inflow gas and outflow gas to the distribution system were stopped). The police was informed.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Emergency leakage control teams measured gas concentrations off-site.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence:&nbsp; The gas holder was taken out of commission and all the sediments and iron cement were removed from cups. The welds were examined and leak checked. The cracks were repaired by welding pressed steel channels over.After the accident, the following measures were established:1- checks on similar gas holders to be foreseen;2- improvement of safety and reliability of water-sealed gas holders;3- development of equipment for the monitoring of the water seal depths in gas holders.Useful references: Theoretical, and also practical studies (involving an old gas holder), have been carried out to evaluate the natural gas concentration beyond the site boundary. Both studies have shown that there was no chance of a flammable concentration of natural gas outside the site boundaries."

The copper contained in the rinsing water is cathodically separated by direct current in the recycling cell, whilst the cyanide ions are removed from the anodes.The causal incident was a short circuit in the electrolytic cell. The short circuit on a pair of electrodes meant that the entire current was directed over one single pair of electrodes, causing considerable heating above fluid level. No substances listed in appendix 1 of the Seveso Directive were involved in the fire itself. The fluid which leaked out of the recycling cell was channelled along the floor drainage system of the in-plant waste water treatment system. ","The fire was caused by a short circuit between cathode and anode in the electrolytic cell for copper recovery and cyanide removal from the wash water of a galvanisation plant. The short circuit was caused by an unusual, one-sided growth of the copper layer from the cathode.",Material damage inside the plant: fire damage to production hall&nbsp; ,"Safety function:Building monitoring system signalled malfunction (compressor) to caretaker, alarm released according emergency response plan, power switched off in production halls, external action forces instructed by way of emergency response plans.Safety measures:- Offsite - Road closed during event - Power switched off in production halls- On-site coordination by technical manager and emergency response manager according to the onsite emergency response plan;Damage repaired:- Soot removed from equipment and parts of building on first floor- Fire proof cover on ground floor replaced- Electrical installation replaced- Damaged system dismantled- Complete renovation of ground floor; Safety measures by offsite emergency response services:Fire extinguished itself, there was no increase in the concentration of toxic substances measured by the fire brigade in the building directly after the event.Evacuation measures by offsite emergency response services: evacuation of production area on first floor of buildings 6 and 8.","Measures to prevent recurrence:- installation of voltage monitors which switch off the rectifier (power source) when voltage changes. The copper contained in the rinsing water is cathodically separated by direct current in the recycling cell, whilst the cyanide ions are removed from the anodes. &nbsp;Direct current is generated by a rectifier. If there is a short circuit between anode and cathode in the recycling cell, the voltage drops (towards 0 V) and the current level reaches the rectifier's capacity. As in the case of a short circuit almost the entire current flows solely via the jumper, the connectors heat up considerably which can cause plastic parts in close proximity to ignite. The voltage monitor activates a relay contact if the voltage changes. This relay contact is used to switch off the rectifier and thus prevent the components from heating up."

141,627,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"Leak, fire and bleve from a pipeline containing blast furnace gas",2006-04-30 14:40:00,2006-05-05 10:00:00,"On 30/04/06 at 14:40 hrs. a plant operator noticed a spot of liquid hydrocarbons (HC) in the trench, in correspondence of the cross point of roads 8 and L, in proximity of the subway of road ex SS114 (sea side). At 15:00 hrs. The leak was localized on a pipeline section 2 m from the subway; in correspondence to road Nr. 9/0; the pipeline connected tank DA1085 in the crude oil tank-farm SG10 with the refinery's topping plant CR20 (as shown in the map included in the records).The company decided to seal the leak by installing a sealing collar on the located rupture point. The workers dismantled the piping insulation (latten and rock wool) in the corresponding pipe section. After the insulation had been dismantled the spill increased with hot hydrocarbons (60° C) spraying downwards towards the subway. The approx. 30 mm long fissure, parallel to the pipe axis presented a 30° angle generating line. A liquid hydrocarbon pool formed and spread at least up to the first detection point due to the slope inclination (some 60 m from the leakage point in the pipe).At 16:10 hrs, the competent authorities for off-site emergencies were alerted by FAX, in compliance with the memorandum of understanding signed with the local authorities.Approximately at 17:35 hrs, immediately after conclusion of the insulation dismantling operation, the personnel staying uphill to the subway, saw smoke coming from the opposite side of the subway (sea side) some 60 m from the leakage point. At this stage, approximately 3 hours after the leak detection the onsite emergency response plan was triggered: - mobilisation of the onsite fire brigade,&nbsp;- isolation the pipe lines starting with the leaking one, as precautionary measure,&nbsp;- closure of road ex SS114 passing through the establishment,The onsite fire brigade mobilised initially two emergency response vehicles, spraying foam on the area were the smoke was generated. At 17:42 hrs the shift commander of the onsite fire brigade alerted the public fire department in Siracusa, once he understood that the fire was out of control.Meanwhile the shift manager called the refinery's emergency response committee and alerted the personnel of Syndial and Polimeri Europa, owners of some of the pipe lines in the affected trench.&nbsp;After a few minutes another fire front developed from the entry of the subway in road Nr 9/0 (uphill), also this fire was fought initially by the onsite emergency response services, with other two fire fighting vehicles.At 18:10 hrs The public fire brigade arrived from Siracusa and took the command of the emergency response management.At 18:50 a first BLEVE explosion occurred in another pipeline line containing probably light hydro carbons, and was followed by successive explosions of pipelines in the same trench, all due to the overheating of the products inside the pipeline consequent to the heat irradiation of the fire in the trench.At 18:55 the decision was taken to shut down all installations inside the establishment, as precautionary measureFire extinguishing operations lasted 48 hours, the fire damaged seriously the pipelines uphill and downhill the subway, as well as aerial pipelines passing parallel to the trench or crossing it. Further limited damage occurred to the subway. During the accident 4 members of the onsite fire brigade, 2 plant operators and 8 members of&nbsp; the public Fire brigade were hospitalised for more than 10 days due to burns, contusions and/or intoxication.","&nbsp;The causes of the accident are of technical nature:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concerning the causes of the leak, it has been determined that the pipe was perforated due to corrosion processes which occurred externally on the pipe surface; as stated in the technical consultancy report of TUV Italia S.R.L (Italian branch of the German Product Certification Organization), prepared on request of the Attorney General's Office of Siracusa (reportr Nr. 165145/06 dated 16.09.06) and deposited on 16/11/2006).-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above mentioned report states in the conclusion ns of the report: ""basing on the results obtained it appears evident that the fissure formed in the pipe is the result of a localised corrosion process (rust), affecting the external pipe surface, consuming the pipe wall until perforation.""The same document states: ""It is likely that the localisation of the fissure, with respect to the point where it formed, is linked to one or more of the following factors:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; localized damage in the original pipe coating-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material defect in the original pipe coating-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; critical operative conditions (of the pipe section in which the fissure occurred) linked to the placement of the pipe near the ground and its exposition to atmospheric events (sea air).The company agrees with this hypothesis on pipe corrosion: The company declares that the pipe was periodically inspected, in compliance with technical norms API 570 ""piping inspection code"", these inspections were formed part of the establishment maintenance program ERG-MED, according to which the last inspection of the pipeline had been performed in February 2005.Concerning this aspect, the technical consultancy report states at page 140 (answer to question Nr. 1 of the Attorney General; that in principle it is not possible to affirm that the maintenance of the pipe in question was insufficient, but it is pointed out that the pipeline examined had been built more than 40 years ago, and was bought from AGIP Petroli Spa in 2002, AGIP did not provide the technical documentation on maintenance operations on the piping bundle prior to the sale. This circumstance has not allowed, according to the technical consultancy report, to verify the compliance with the technical norms on visual tests, inspections and maintenance of the piping system concerned.Concerning the cause of the fire, the company made the supposition that, , the contact between the vapours formed from the spilled hydrocarbons with hot spots of high pressure steam pipes, reaching up to 280° steam temperature, in correspondence of the subway, may have contributed to the expansion of a vapour cloud; the vapour cloud ignited on an ignition source downhill from the subway were the first fire was detected.Concerning the successive BLEVEs, which caused major damage to the persons involved in the emergency response operations, these are related directly to the permanent heat irradiation of the fire (which lasted approx. 48 hrs), which overheated other pipelines containing hydrocarbons also in gas form in the pipe string. Concerning the direct involvement of the company, the same company states that the event may have had less serious consequences if the onsite fire brigade would have been alerted immediately at leak detection and not three hours later, as effectively happened.This assumption is confirmed by the technical consultancy report, which affirms that if the onsite fire brigade would have been alerted more rapidly the damages caused by the fire could have been contained.Concerning this aspect it has to be said that the Attorney General's Office is still investigating on the matter.The Human error indicated relates to the faulty application of the Emergency procedures foreseen in the onsite Emergency Plan.The fault during the Repair operation (dismantling of the pipe insulation layer) relates to the failure to adopt appropriate safety measures during the operation.The design fault relates to the inadequate design and rationalisation of the pipe bundle.","Human injuries:10 persons injured hospitalised for more than 24 hours- 8 members of the public fire brigade presenting contusions and burns with a prognosis of more than 10 days hospitalisation- 2 members of the onsite fire brigade presenting contusions and burns (2 days hospitalisation for the tam member with contusions and 30 days hospitalisation for the team member with burns)- 2 plant operators and 2 members of the onsite fire brigade presenting slight injuries caused by contusions and burns and respiratory difficulties were attended by the onsite sanitary service and dismissed promptly.The accident occurred during a week end (Sunday 30 of April) with only the shift personnel of the ERG Nord Refinery of approx. 60 people present onsite, of which 9 formed part of the onsite fire brigade.The number of offsite emergency response personnel (public fire brigade) involved in the response operation, which lasted several days, was of approx. 40 people.The population living in the neighbourhood of the establishment was not affected whereas the personnel of neighbouring establishments (Polimeri Europa, Erg NUCE, Syndial), were potentially exposed to riskSoil and water-shed pollution damage:- Spill of liquid hydrocarbons, extinguishing water on a surface of approx. 800 m2.The company has monitored the water shed on request of the Regional&nbsp; competent Authority by employing the existing piezometers nearest to the area affected, and did not detect any significant variations of the pollution levels with respect to the values determined before the accident.Release of combustion products in the atmosphere :- ARPA - Sicilia (department of Siracusa) has recorded significant increases of Non Methanic Hydrocarbons (NMHC) concentrations in air during the days ranging from 30 of April to 2 of March (maximal concentration of 1917 micrograms/m3 detected on 1 of May 2006 at 9:00 hrs) at the air quality monitoring stations of&nbsp; Scala Greca, Priolo e Melilli with peak values measured at Belvedere; no significant concentration increases of other substances was measured.The wind conditions contributed significantly in dispersing the combustion gas column towards the sea, with precipitation of the particles far from populated areas. The Inter-company Environmental Protection Consortium (Consorzio Interaziendale protezione ambiente - CIPA) has performed an Environmental Impact Analysis of the event and has established that the average concentration levels measured on a three-hourly base, never reached the threshold value of 200 micrograms/m3 (ex DPCM n° 30 dated 23 March 1983)The accident has not caused an environmental impact. There has been only a leakage of liquid hydrocarbons on a surface of approx. 800 m2. The area has been cleaned by excavating the ground until 30 cm depth.As already mentioned in the short report:The company has monitored the water shed on request of the Regional&nbsp; competent Authority by employing the existing piezometers nearest to the area affected, and did not detect any significant variations of the pollution levels with respect to the values determined before the accident.Emission of combustion products in the atmosphere :- ARPA - Sicilia (department of Siracusa) has recorded significant increases of Not Methanic Hydrocarbons (NMHC) concentrations in air during the days ranging from 30 of April to 2 of March (maximal concentration of 1917 micrograms/m3 detected on 1 of May 2006 at 9:00 hrs) at the air quality monitoring stations of&nbsp; Scala Greca, Priolo e Melilli with peak values measured at Belvedere; no significant concentration increases of other substances were measured for other chemical compounds.The wind conditions contributed significantly in dispersing the combustion gas column towards the sea, with precipitation of the particles far from populated areas. The Inter-company Environmental Protection Consortium (Consorzio Interaziendale protezione ambiente - CIPA) has performed an Environmental Impact Analysis of the event and has established that the average concentration levels of hazardous substances on a three-hourly base never reached the threshold value of 200 micrograms/m3 (ex DPCM n° 30 dated 23 March 1983)Material damage:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destruction of the pipelines affected by the fire and explosions, damage to a significant part of the pipe bundle located immediately uphill and downhill to the underway, on a approx. 200 m long section. A approx. 330 m long pipe bundle section has been completely substituted. -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage to the pipe racks immediately adjacent to the subway.Loss of production costs for a total of approx. 110.000.000 Euros have to be added the damage calculation.Offsite:Damage to the asphalt coating of road ex SS114 on a approx. 100 m long section.Community Disruption:road ex SS114 was closed during approx 53 days.Rail road Catania-Siracusa was closed during 48 hours.The ship circulation in the port of Augusta) was interrupted by the port authorities of Augusta during approx. 36 hours. All merchant ships present in the port of Augusta (14 ships, 9 docked and 5 FONDA) left the port.The Public schools of Priolo were closed for 1 day.The event had a relevant resonance at national level with a coverage by national&nbsp; television and newspapers.","The onsite emergency plan has been triggered, initially an extended emergency was declared, and successively an major accident was declared, in compliance with the Onsite Emergency Plan.Chronology of the measures adopted:At 16:10 hrs the authorities competent for emergencies were alerted by FAX, in compliance with the common agreement protocol with the local authorities.Approximately at 17:35 hrs, immediately after the insulation dismantling operation had been concluded, the personnel staying uphill to the subway, saw smoke coming from the opposite side off the subway (sea side) some 60 m from the leakage point. At this stage, approximately 3 hours after the leak detection the onsite emergency response plan was triggered: - mobilisation of the onsite fire brigade,&nbsp;- isolation of the pipe lines starting with the leaking one, as precautionary measure,&nbsp;- closing of road ex SS114 passing through the establishment,The onsite fire brigade intervened initially with two vehicles, spraying foam on the area were the smoke was coming from. At 17:42 hrs the shift fire brigade commander alerted the fire department in Siracusa when he understood that the fire was out of control.Meanwhile the shift manager called the refinery's emergency response committee and alerted the personnel of Syndial and Polimeri Europa, owners of some pipe lines in the affected trench.After a few minutes another fire front developed from the entry of the subway in road Nr 9/0 (uphill), also this fire was fought initially by the onsite emergency response services, with other two fire fighting vehicles.At 18:10 hrs The public fire brigade from Siracusa arrived and took command of the emergency response management.At 18:50 a first BLEVE explosion occurred in another pipeline line containing probably light hydro carbons, and was followed by successive explosions of pipelines in the same trench, all due to the overheating of the products inside the pipeline consequent to the heat irradiation of the fire in the trench.At 18:55 the decision was taken to shut down of all installations inside the establishment, as precautionary measure.Fire extinguishing operations lasted 48 hours in all, the accident developed in different successive phases with the fire catching strength, from 3 of May in the morning to 4 of May in the evening. The emergency response operations continued with monitoring and cooling measures of the area affected until the following day, when the prefect declared the end of the emergency.The fire extinguishing operations have been managed in such way to confine the fire in the area corresponding to the subway without extinguishing the fire completely, in order to eliminate completely the presence of hydrocarbons from the hardly accessible trench, where hydrocarbon vapours could have ignited again at any point.Competent Authorities involved (alerted or actively involved in the response)Prefecture of Siracusa, Communal Civil Protection of Priolo and Mellili. Civil Protection of the Sicily Region, Carabinieri, State Police, Attorney General's Office, ARPA Siracusa department.&nbsp;At 18:55 the shut down of all installations inside the establishment was decided as precautionary measure.The Prefect ordered the closure of all gates of the establishment in accordance with the Offsite Emergency Plan, this caused the interruption of all vehicle circulation in the area around the accident place for several days. The circulation on the Siracusa-Catania railway was interrupted during 48 hours, and the ship circulation in the port of Augusta was interrupted during approx. 36 hours.The road exnSS114 was closed during 53 days, waiting for the results of the static structural tests and the substitution of the damaged asphalt covering.The offsite emergency has not caused health consequences to the population living in the neighbouring Communes. The major of Priolo ordered the closure of the public schools for one day&nbsp; and invited the population to stay indoors immediately after the accident as precautionary measure.Emergency measures - Remarks: ""Rebuilding"" refers to the repair of the subway, the substitution of the pavement, the road signs and the guardrails of ex SS114 damaged by the fire on a approx. 100m long road section.
Official action taken - legal action: The Attorney General's Office of Siracusa has opened a criminal proceeding against some of the refinery's managers, with the objective to determine the causes and the responsibilities related to the accident.  With this objective the Attorney General's office has charged a commission of three experts, who officially delivered and deposited on 16/11/2006 a technical consultancy report, copy of which has also been given to the Commission.
The criminal proceeding is still under way.
TUV Italia  S.r.l. has performed a specific study (report  nThe Attorney General's Office of Siracusa has opened a criminal proceeding against some of the refinery's managers, with the objective to determine the causes and the responsibilities related to the accident.&nbsp; With this objective the Attorney General's office has charged a commission of three experts, who officially delivered and deposited on 16/11/2006 a technical consultancy report, copy of which has also been given to the Commission.The criminal proceeding is still under way.TUV Italia&nbsp; S.r.l. has performed a specific study (report&nbsp; n° 165145/06 of 16.09.06), on request of the Attorney General in the context of the Technical Consultancy Report, aimed to identify the causes which lead to the leak in the pipe.The company has performed a preliminary technical investigation on the event, with the help of external experts and consultants, with the aim to identify the preliminary causes of the accident, and has deposited a technical report at the Attorney General's Office of Siracusa on 19/05/06.The Commission has obtained the information needed to formulate the present Major Accident Report from the two above mentioned reports, from direct discussions with the Company and from other documentation analysed.Official action taken - other official action: 
On 5 may 2006, immediately after the occurrence, the Technical Regional Committee of Sicily met in the premises of the Fire Department in Siracusa, with the goal to discuss the case, the requests request to realise technical modification measures in the installation and the request to present a detailed project for the redesign and improvement of the pipe bundle involved in the accident.The company has complied with the requests, by presenting the project in two phases, NOF which has been already approved by the Regional Technical Committee, and the detailed project which is under examination.Seveso II duties  - remarks:The 2005 safety Report foresaw an accident scenario similar to the one occurred, i.e. the rupture of a gasoline and/or LPG pipeline forming part of a pipe bundle inside a trench in-between a subway and the railway. For the rupture of a gasoline pipe the extension of the damage area had been estimated in maximally 30m, corresponding to a heat irradiation of 3kw/m2 (reversible damage area), involving either road ex SS114 and the railway depending from the source location. Therefore the effects of the heat irradiation foreseen in the accident scenario of the Safety Report are compatible with the effects of the accident which occurred really.The management faults occurred during the event, i.e. the faulty application of the emergency response procedures foreseen in the onsite emergency response plan, points out the need to improve the training of the personnel, with a particular focus on emergency management.Following the event the Regional Technical Committee has delivered the technical feasibility authorisation concerning the reconstruction of the pipe bundle and the repair of the subway (resolution n° 87&nbsp;&nbsp; 12/12/06). In March 2007 the company has presented the safety report on the detailed project phase.The municipality of Priolo has not requested the information necessary to prepare a Ajor Accident Report according to DM 9 May 2001.","Immediate lessons:&nbsp; Critical equipment aspects encountered onsite the establishment immediately after the accident:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pipe bundle disposition inside the trench and also inside the
subway was such to cause extreme difficulties during the emergency
response operations;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;there was a large number of closely packed pipes, containing
different kinds of liquids (and in particular hazardous ones), which
were not immediately identifiable and traceable;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the presence and vicinity in the same bundle of pipes containing
hazardous substances and pipes with high pressure/temperature steam
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mix up of the pipe lay-out of utility pipes (and in particular the
extinguishing water pipe) with the product transfer pipes, this
circumstance has caused the overpressure in the isolated pipe tract
exposed to the heat irradiation from the fire and the consequent
explosion of the pipes and interrupted the extinguishing water supply
from the pipe inside the bundle and damaged also another suspended
extinguishing water pipe crossing the pipe bundle;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high hold-up levels of the tube bundle, due to the reduced number isolating valves on the pipe-lines;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inadequate gradient arrangement, absence of retaining curbs and of adequate water drainage systems.

Critical management aspects found: 
- Incomplete compliance with the Onsite Emergency Plan: The onsite
fire-brigade was alerted&nbsp; only three hours after the crude oil leak
detection.
- age (more than 25 years) and state of conservation of the pipe
triggering the event, with respect to progressive corrosion processes
encountered, which finally caused the leak;.
The company stated that periodical inspections had been performed
according to the technical ""Piping inspection code"" API 570 on the
event triggering pipe;
These periodical inspections were part of the establishment's
maintenance program ERG-MED, according to which the last inspection on
the above mentioned pipe had been performed in February 2005. 
Following the accident the company asked the specialist American
company Fluor Daniel to assess the inspection methodology employed by
the company and to propose possible improvements.

The company has realised following structural measures on the installation, with respect to the above mentioned aspects:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; total reconstruction of the pipe bundle over a length of 300 m,
according to a project integrating the requests formulated by the
Technical Regional Committee of Sicily (resolution CTR dated
05/05/2006) and additional considerations formulated by the company.
The reconstruction and modification project was divided in several phases:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phase 1: reactivation of the product loading - unloading wharf
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phase 2: start up of the pipe lines and plant parts which were not damaged or functionally affected by the fire.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phase 3: restoration and modification of the damaged pipes

The reconstruction project of the pipe bundle included in particular:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rationalizing the piping layout, according to risk categories, inside of dedicated trench ducts;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Division of the subway in segments with fire resistant
segmentation plates such to separate the pipes according to the
substance categories transported;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passive fire protection of the steel structures supporting the pipe bundles inside the subway;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Illumination, accessibility and inspectability of the subway
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installation of:
&nbsp;adequate retaining curbs inside the trench such to limit the extension of fire inside the trench,
&nbsp;paving and drainage systems connected with the establishment sewage system;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasing the number of extinguishing monitors, assuring the protection and coverage of the entire trench
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installation of further Emercency Isolation Valves (EIV) on all
critical pipe lines, the signals of the valves are transmitted to the
control room and to the safety room of the area;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installation of Thermal Reaction Valves (TRV) on all isolatable pipe line sections.
The company evaluates to extend the above mentioned technical
improvements to the other subways of the refinery, depending under
other factors from the results of the evaluation by the Technical
Regional Committee (CTR).

Corrective actions in the management:
- On 21/06/06 a meeting of the Safety and Health Committee was
organized, with the goal to analyse the event and point out the lessons
learnt and the measures to be taken.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase the frequency of training courses for the personnel by internal training personnel
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foresee specific updating courses for the training personnel, and
specific training courses for the department foremen and the management
of the company
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improve the circulation of the contents of the safety report such to improve the safety consciousness of the personnel
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identification by the department foremen of sensitive aspects
needing improvement in the Safety Management System (SMS), e.g.
incompleteness or excessive complexity. of the procedures foreseen by
the SMS.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Identification of behavioural dynamics in the personnel
indicating reduced attention to safety and setting up a safety prize
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase the frequency of training courses for the personnel in
particular concerning the respect of emergency response procedures,
following the cascade principle.
At the date of the present report the company declared to have realised
the majority of the management measures described above: Moreover it is
planned to update the technical and operative documentation related to
the technical modification measures mentioned.

142,167,Major Accident,"Fuel storage (including heating, retail sale, etc.)",Fire in a toluene tank in a tank storage facility,2014-01-09 14:58:00,2014-01-09 16:21:00,"When testing fire extinguishing equipment on an adjacent tank, the fire extinguisher for the toluene tank was accidentally loaded with water and activated due to incorrect labelling on the extinguishing agent distribution system outside the tank pit. This caused a fire extinguishing hose in the toluene tank to unroll.
The hose, made from a non-conductive synthetic material, presumably released an electrostatic charge when it came into contact with the low-conductivity product (toluene). This charge was most likely sufficient to ignite the explosive atmosphere present in the tank under normal operating conditions.
The pressure of the explosion tore off the top of the fixed-roof tank, leading to a tank fire with soot (black carbon) emissions.
The fire was fought by the plant’s own fire service with support from external professional and industry fire services.
Fire brigade and police deployment, measurements (hydrocarbons, toluene) around the area of the incident and outside the plant, blocking off the tank, extinguishing the fire using foam, cooling the adjacent tanks by spraying with water, retention of the used water in the tank retention ponds, temporary suspension of rail traffic.","Incorrect labelling on extinguishing water distribution system, which led to a mix-up of the extinguishing agent pipes and thus to the unintentional activation of the extinguishing system in the toluene tank.
The labels on the extinguishing water distribution system were presumably mixed up during earlier maintenance work.","Irreparably deformed tank and severely damaged peripheral equipment, cracks in the tank pit, minor damage to adjacent tanks.
Soil contamination:Approximately &nbsp;1217 tonnes of soil excavated in the area of the damage, subsurface soil contamination with toluene and perfluorinated surfactants (PFT).","Incident reported in accordance with the emergency response and safety plan, internal fire service and emergency team alerted using emergency contact list, tank blocked off, request for assistance from external fire services, local residents warned using sirens and radio announcements, evacuation of persons from the area of danger, presence of hazardous substances in the area surrounding the incident and outside the plant investigated by the fire service and the State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection (LANUV), foam sprayed onto the burning tank, spraying (cooling) of neighbouring tanks, deployment of mobile extinguishing equipment, used water retained within the plant (tank retention pond, drains, several storage tanks).
Proper disposal of approximately 15000 tonnes of used water:– Heat treatment of used water containing high levels of hydrocarbons.– Biological and chemical-physical treatment of used water containing low levels of hydrocarbons (cross-border movement).
Dismantling of the deformed toluene tank and the severely damaged equipment, repairing the damage to adjacent tanks, repairs to the tank retention pond and the pipe trench, settlement of recognised claims for damage caused by soot (black carbon) pollution.
Blocking off and emptying the damaged tank, extraction and disposal of the used water in accordance with a corresponding declaration analysis, tests on the impermeability of the tank retention pond.
Warning local residents using sirens and radio announcements, support for the plant fire service in fighting the fire, a special operation by the LANUV to take swipe samples around the city of Cologne and laboratory analysis of the samples.","
The labelling of all extinguishing equipment on site was checked. No more incorrect labels were found. In the regular annual checks on the fire protection equipment on tanks, labels and pipe layout will also be checked.
The deficiencies identified in checks on the adjacent tanks were rectified promptly. The damaged toluene tank was dismantled and the tank retention pond was cleaned. The cleaning measures recommended by the geotechnical engineer were carried out.
The manufacturer of the semi-subsurface extinguishing system was informed that, in plants with similar storage conditions and similar substances, incorrect deployment of the fire extinguishing equipment could produce an ignition source.
The manufacturer is currently testing the possibility of replacing the existing hose with one made out of a conductive material. Until the outcome is known, organisational measures will be taken at the plant to ensure that the fire extinguishing equipment is not set off by accident (checks on labelling, cable fuses on the final valves on the tank).
If it proves possible to substitute the hose material and if tests confirm the material’s suitability, technical documentation can be drawn up to provide proof of suitability and enable the purchase of new and replacement parts.
The layout of the semi-subsurface fire extinguishing equipment in the toluene tank was examined by an expert and clearly presented. The examination did not reveal any work that was required.. The ignition sources analysis for the tank farm affected by the fire will be reviewed. Generally applicable points will be incorporated into an overarching explosion protection document, which will be finalised by the end of 2015.


The testing basis, scope and intervals and the format of the test reports for the equipment in each department are laid down using the findings from the ignition source analysis. Furthermore, the instructions for testing staff (those authorised to carry out tests, authorised experts, etc.) will be laid down and links will be created to quickly locate testing documents.

With regard to public safety, a D3 announcement will be made at an early stage for future incidents with a comparable external impact."

A likely cause is considered to have been a fault in a plug socket, which spread to the adjacent pump and plastic installations.
However, this could not be conclusively determined by the operator, as the insurer’s loss adjuster was only mandated to assess the consequential losses and the measures to repair the fire damage. There was no safety check of the electrical system by an expert within the meaning of Section 29b of the Federal Immission Control Act, nor was a fire expert engaged.
During the fire, an electroplating bath containing 1,900 litres of sulfamate nickel leaked its contents. Electrical equipment and large parts of the air extraction system and the surrounding electrical installations were destroyed. The fire was contained and extinguished by the fire brigade. The leaked electrolyte and the fire-fighting water was retained in the collecting area in the basement. The contaminated water was subsequently pumped across to IBCs. These are to be disposed of properly in the coming days.
Safety measure:A newly-installed fire alarm system was in maintenance mode at the time. Although it did detect the fire, it did not report it.
About an hour later a member of staff on the late shift noticed the fire and called the fire brigade.","The cause of the fire cannot conclusively be determined due to the damage pattern.A likely cause is considered to have been a fault in a plug socket, which spread to the adjacent pump and plastic installations.",Fire damage to nickel bath I pump and surrounding installations and smoke damage to the other treatment baths.,"
- Evacuation of the danger area
- Shutdown of all supply equipment
- Retention of content of the damaged nickel bath.

Repairs to the damaged areas began recently.","Additional checks on the electrical equipment in the room by a specialised firm. The equipment is to be reconstructed in accordance with a reconstruction plan drawn up by a specialised firm. This involves replacing the baths, which were hitherto excessively large, by smaller ones and relocating them where appropriate.The new fire alarm system has in the meantime been armed and, in the medium term, is also to be connected to the fire brigade.

The internal emergency plan is to be revised and updated to ensure that the operator’s reporting requirements are fulfilled.&nbsp;
The electrical equipment in the whole plant is to be checked promptly by a suitably qualified employee. In addition, thermographic measurements are also to be taken.The implementation of the checks is to be documented.
All electrical and mechanical components that are liable to overheat in the event of a malfunction are to be checked regularly at intervals of no more than two months by means of thermographic measurements. The results are to be documented. This interval may be adjusted in response to the actual frequency of faults being detected.These checks are to be carried out systematically. The management system is to be updated accordingly. Operating procedures are to be drawn up or existing ones amended.
Across the whole site, any contaminated firefighting water in the event of an incident is to be contained safely using state of the art safety equipment. For this purpose, the operator is to check whether the firefighting water containment capacity available in the individual hall sections is sufficient. Where necessary, steps are to be taken to increase the firefighting water containment capacity.

In this context, attention should be paid to the following:

Measures to contain firefighting water are to be carried out in accordance with good engineering practice in safety matters.
All indoor pipes, such as rainwater pipes and other openings to the sewers, are to be protected up to the necessary damming level for firefighting water retention by fireproof bunding or protective tubes made from chemical-resistant, non-flammable materials so that in the event of a fire, firefighting water cannot flow unchecked into pipes or openings.


The pumps used are tools within the meaning of the Industrial Safety Ordinance, as the pump is an integral part of an electroplating system and is used to pump substances around that system.These tools are subject to damage from the atmosphere prevalent in the electroplating system and the substances to be pumped. To be used, they need to be operated, maintained, dismantled and monitored.The employer must assess the risk arising from the use of tools and take the appropriate safety measures accordingly. This also means taking into account the hazards arising from the use of the tool within the working environment. The manufacturer’s instructions on testing cycles, among other things, give rise to the following measures for testing tools:


The risk assessment pursuant to the Industrial Safety Ordinance should be revised and documented with regard to the issues raised above.
Measures arising from this are to be implemented.

147,139,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion and fire on the amine recovery unit at,2011-06-02 18:20:00,2011-06-02 18:50:00,"
Shortly after 6pm, on 2 June 2011, an atmospheric storage tank within the amine regeneration unit at the Refinery exploded. A fireball split the tank open and killed four workers. One survivor sustained severe burns and suffered life-changing injuries.
The force of the explosion ejected the five-tonne steel tank roof over 55 metres through the air. After narrowly missing a multi-fuel pipe track, the roof crashed onto a pressurised storage sphere containing extremely flammable butane. Good fortune prevented the airborne roof from puncturing the butane storage vessel, which would have led to an uncontrolled release of liquified petroleum gas (LPG).
The explosion was caused by the unintended ignition of a flammable atmosphere within the tank (17T302), during what should have been a routine cleaning operation conducted in preparation for maintenance.
The investigation revealed a longstanding and widespread failure to understand and control risks posed by the flammable atmosphere inside the tank. The explosion and the resulting fatalities were therefore avoidable. The incident was not merely the consequence of errors by individual employees, but because of the failure of safety management systems to ensure a safe place and safe systems of work.

&nbsp;","
&nbsp;Lack of knowledge regarding light hydrocarbons in tank 17T302
The Refinery possessed information relating to the contamination of the ARU running tank with light hydrocarbon. However, key Chevron personnel, some of them senior, were not aware of this fact or the magnitude of contamination. For example, the procedure entitled ‘Action to take on LPG getting in to the ARU/SRU Flare Drum’, designed to prevent LPG entering the running tank, was not fit for purpose and routinely ignored.
Inadequate risk review
Following the decision in 1998 to operate the ARU as a closed system, there were a number of events that should have triggered a review of the unit risk assessment, in particular the need for repeated removal of excess light hydrocarbon material that had accumulated within the running tank. At no time did this repeated accumulation of material trigger an investigation into the cause, including sampling and analysis of the excess hydrocarbon material removed.
The application of site-wide procedures, for example for hazardous area classification (HAC), should have, but did not, identify the risk of a flammable atmosphere within the running tank.No safe system of work
The work carried out was not based upon a formal procedure or work instruction, which itself should have been developed based upon a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, industry guidance (for example the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice, Part 16: Tank Cleaning Safety Code) and DSEAR regulatory requirements.
Significantly, the risks posed by two potential ignition sources (electrostatic spark and self-ignition of pyrophoric material) were not fully appreciated or controlled.&nbsp;
","
Explosion incident
An explosion occurred within tank 17T302 at 18:19 hrs. After the initial point of ignition, the overpressure created by the expanding combustion gases within the vessel ripped the tank shell away from the floor and subsequently ejected the roof. A fireball jetted from the base of the vessel, which fire-engulfed the immediate area to the south, including the vacuum tanker vehicle.
The explosive force projected the 5-tonne tank roof approximately 55m (see Figure 12) in a north-easterly direction to its first point of impact with the ground, narrowly missing a multi-fuel pipe track by 1m, before somersaulting and colliding with a butane storage sphere, causing structural damage to the vessel legs and supports (see Figure 13).
Four Contractors were killed and one&nbsp;was severely burned, sustaining life-changing injuries.
The fire was brought under control using on-site firefighting staff and equipment. It was extinguished within approximately 23 minutes. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue service attended, deploying 10 pumps. A police helicopter used thermal imaging cameras to search for additional casualties. The COMAH on-site emergency plan proved largely effective in this case, as the fire was contained and did not spread to neighbouring vessels.

&nbsp;","The fire was brought under control using on-site firefighting staff and equipment. It was extinguished within approximately 23 minutes.

The COMAH on-site emergency plan proved largely effective in this case, as the fire was contained and did not spread to neighbouring vessels.","
HSE believes that the deaths were preventable. The fact that the tank contained flammable material emerged several times, but the Operator did not take the opportunity to train staff and update their systems. Any change of plant operation should be critically risk assessed, adequately controlled and relevant systems updated accordingly, to ensure the significance of a newly generated hazard is not lost over time. This is particularly important where hazardous waste streams are recycled back into the process.
Other opportunities to prevent the explosion were also missed. Two days before the incident, a gas test indicated a potentially explosive atmosphere within the tank, but this information was either not shared or acted upon by those planning or carrying out the job. Companies should reflect upon this failure and review their own systems to ensure that they provide training and arrangements for the recording and communication of important safety-critical information.
This incident clearly demonstrates that safety management systems are only effective when robustly audited, monitored and enforced. Safety arrangements that have been allowed to degrade over time become weak and ineffective. Whilst providing an illusion of safety and risk control, as seen in this case, ineffective systems do not remain strong enough to prevent real harm occurring. This prosecution serves as a reminder to those with a responsibility for employees and contractors to actively monitor their safety management system arrangements and ensure they are effective in keeping workers safe.
Broader lessons
The law requires that companies should possess clear and accurate information regarding hazardous material stored within tanks. Furthermore, all employees and contractors involved in planning and maintenance activities on tanks should know and understand the dangers presented by the materials inside. This should include rigorous analysis (including sampling when appropriate) of the hazards of all constituents remaining within the tank prior to starting removal work. Section 2.5 of the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Guidance on Tank Cleaning contains detailed information regarding pre-cleaning checks and inspections.
A risk assessment and the establishment of clear work instructions for any tank cleaning operation should be conducted by trained and competent staff.
To organise the work as safely as possible, the planning and preparation work should be based on knowledge of the hazardous tank contents, combined with a good understanding of and adherence to the published HSE guidance and specific tank cleaning standards, for example the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Tank Cleaning Safety Code.
HSE believe there are some clear lessons to be learned for all businesses in relation to safety management systems. Our recommendations are set out below.
1.&nbsp; Process safety performance indicators
Effective management of major hazards requires a proactive approach to risk management. Information to confirm that critical systems are operating as intended is essential. Carefully chosen process safety performance indicators can monitor the status of key systems, providing assurance that major hazard risks are under control or an early warning, should controls deteriorate. HSE publication HSG254 Developing process safety indicators: A step-by-step guide for chemical and major hazard industries contains practical information.
2. Process modification and the management of change
Process modifications, in this case converting the ARU from an open to a closed system, should not be undertaken without having carried out a safety, engineering and technical review. Risk assessment should then identify what hazards have been created by the change that may affect plant or personnel safety, and what action can be implemented to reduce or eliminate the risk.
Changes may affect other parts of the plant which may be remote from the source of the change. Therefore, all parts of the plant should be considered in undertaking hazard identification and risk assessments. Additional hazards that may be introduced which need to be considered include fire, explosion and loss of containment. Further guidance can be found within HSE publication L111 The Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 2015: Guidance on Regulations.
3. Safety-critical communications
A communications protocol should be developed and embedded within the workplace for the transmission of safety-critical information. In this case the %LEL reading that was taken from the top of the tank on 31 May 2011. For effective communication, information to be shared should be conveyed through more than one medium, for example oral and written, combined with clarification and confirmation offered by the recipient. Clearly this relies upon employers ensuring that those involved in a task understand what constitutes safety-critical information. HSE publication HSG48 Reducing error and influencing behaviour contains relevant guidance.
4. Competence management systems
Hazard identification, risk assessments and risk controls are all essential elements in ensuring that effective workplace precautions are implemented. Systems need to be in place to ensure that those carrying out these tasks are trained and competent, and that their work is monitored by competent managers.
Employers should ensure that an effective competence management system is in place, so that staff are adequately trained and competent to undertake the tasks for which they are responsible. This should include arrangements for limiting staff engagement in complex safety-critical activities, when deputising for senior colleagues. The Office of Rail and Road publication Developing and maintaining staff competence provides useful guidance.
5.&nbsp; Management of contractors
The law requires that companies should possess clear and accurate information regarding hazardous material stored within tanks. Furthermore, all employees and contractors involved in planning and maintenance activities on tanks should know and understand the dangers presented by the materials inside. This should include rigorous analysis (including sampling when appropriate) of the hazards of all constituents remaining within the tank prior to starting removal work. Section 2.5 of the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Guidance on Tank Cleaning contains detailed information regarding pre-cleaning checks and inspections.
Companies engaged in the use of contractors should assume the role of an ‘intelligent customer’, rather than relying solely upon the contractor’s knowledge and experience. An intelligent customer will establish the regulatory and industry standards to which the contractor is expected to conform. The company will use this information to supervise the contractor’s performance and verify the adequacy of work carried out on its behalf. The Office of Nuclear Regulation guide Licensee Core Safety and Intelligent Customer Capabilities provides useful information.
6.&nbsp; Contractor competence
Contracting companies should understand HSE legislation, guidance and industrial standards relevant to their work activities. Technical requirements associated with topic-specific guidance, such as tank cleaning, should form a critical part of safety management systems. This is particularly important in relation to risk assessment, established systems of work, the procurement of work equipment, training and competence assessment.

148,21,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion in the ethylene oxide re-distillation column in a petrochemical industry,1987-07-03 19:08:00,1987-07-03 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
During the start-up, an explosion occurred in the redistillation column of the ethylene oxide plant which came into operation in 1969 in a petrochemical industry. This plant had been shut-down in June from 1 to 23. When it was started up problems were experienced in stabilizing the column and a number of repairs were made to the pumps and instrumentation. On the day of the explosion, the column was sufficiently stable. When the explosion occurred all the employees were by chance in the control room. No alarm signals sounded during the last 30 minutes before the explosion occurred except the general alarm that sounded a few seconds before. Despite of the difficult internal communication caused by the destruction of the internal telephone and alarm systems and the emergency control centre, the operators started to shut-down the other plants of the factory and to fight the fire. The external emergency services and the authorities were informed on the accident and the emergency plan for the Antwerp harbour was activated. The emergency services arrived on site in 10 minutes and with the help of the factory's operators put out the fire and the release of chemicals within half an hour. 13 operators (two of them were of an external factory working for BP Chemicals) and a person outside the establishment (working in a neighbouring factory) were slightly hurt. The most serious injury was a broken arm. There were considerable damages inside the establishment: the redistillation column (32 metres high and 2.3 metres in diameter) was completely destroyed and pieces were found up to 700 metres away, some in a neighbouring factory. The ethylene oxide plant and other nearby plants were seriously damaged. Most of the buildings in a radius of 300 metres were damaged. The internal alarm and telephone systems were damaged and could not be used. The emergency control room was also unusable. Outside the establishment, window panes were broken in neighbouring factories and the nearby village of Zwijndrecht (about 1 km away). Nobody was hurt in the village.","CAUSES:
The accident was caused by the decomposition of ethylene oxide at the base section of the redistillation column. There are two possible causes for this accident:
1- a leak of ethylene oxide from a flange that had been insulated during shut-down. During the start-up, the released ethylene oxide reacted exothermically with the binders of the lagging and this caused a temperature increase that ignited the ethylene oxide;
2. the development of a hot spot in a quiescent area of the column caused by the polymerization of ethylene oxide catalysed by rust deposits (this is less likely because no conclusive evidence of it was found).","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:
13 operators (two of them were of an external factory working for BP
Chemicals) and a person outside the establishment (working in a
neighbouring factory) were slightly hurt. The most serious injury was a
broken arm. Nobody was hurt in the nearby village of Zwijndrecht.
MATERIAL LOSS:
There was considerable damage inside the establishment: the
redistillation column (32 metres high and 2.3 metres in diameter) was
completely destroyed and pieces were found up to 700 metres away, some
in a neighbouring factory. The ethylene oxide plant and other nearby
plants were seriously damaged. Most of the buildings in a radius of 300
metres were damaged. The internal alarm and telephone systems were
damaged and could not be used. The emergency control room was also
unusable. Outside the establishment, window panes were broken in
neighbouring factories and the nearby village of Zwijndrecht (about 1
km away).
COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:
Outside the establishment, window panes were broken in neighbouring
factories and the nearby village of Zwijndrecht (about 1 km away). The emergency plan for the Antwerp harbour was activated."," INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:
No alarm signals sounded during the last 30 minutes before the
explosion occurred except the general alarm that sounded a few seconds
before. Despite of the difficult internal communication caused by the
destruction of the internal telephone and alarm systems and the
emergency control centre, the operators started to shut-down the other
plants of the factory and to fight the fire. The external emergency
services and the authorities were informed on the accident. The
emergency services arrived on site in 10 minutes and with the help of
the factory's operators put out the fire and the release of chemicals
within half an hour.
EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:
The external emergency services and the authorities were informed on
the accident and the emergency plan for the Antwerp harbour was
activated.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","MEASURES
TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:
After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- flanges must not be insulated. If insulation was necessary, the
insulation material had to be checked on a possible reaction with
ethylene oxide. Use of proper gaskets for flanges;
2- all pipeworks and pieces of equipment that may contain rust must be
cleaned and inspected before restarting the installation.
MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE ACCIDENT:
After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- improvement of both communication and alarm systems;
2- installation of a second control room to be used in emergency
situations;
3- modifications of the access system;
4- revision of the internal emergency plan including a better method of
identifying people on-site;
5- additional access road to the establishment;
6- improvement of the existing supply for fire fighting water.&nbsp;"
149,594,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),"Explosion inside a tank during the unloading of nitric acid from a road tanker, and subsequent release of toxic cloud",1988-05-16 08:00:00,1988-05-16 00:00:00,"At 07:55 a strong explosion inside a tank occurred during the unloading of nitric acid from a road tanker, followed by the release of a cloud with a yellow/red colour. The cloud had a strong smell and caused irritation of the eyes and skin. The main pollutants were nitrogen oxides. It seems that, by mistake, the operator connected the road tanker to the wrong tank, i.e. he emptied the nitric acid into a tank containing formic acid. The mixing of the two acids produced a rapid exothermic reaction that led to the explosion. The man attending the operation was killed by the explosion. Few minutes later the fire brigade intervened (using personal breathing apparatuses and protective clothing), diluted the liquid acid on the ground with water and created a containment to prevent the acid spreading over on the ground. Nebulized water was also used to dilute the nitrogen oxides vapours. In the meantime the evolution of the cloud (directed towards the sea) was continuously observed from a helicopter. Personnel on the helicopter relieved that the cloud was rapidly dispersing in about 100 metres from the source of release. At about 12:00 the concentration of the cloud, diluted by the action of wind, was no more dangerous.The exploded tank was cut along the inferior weld; some parts have been found at about 50 metres away while the top flange in which the relief valves were installed was found at about 100 metres away. Two other empty tanks, nearby to the exploded one, were found at 25 metres from the point where the accident occurred. The road tanker struck a wall. Some buildings inside the establishment suffered extensive damages. Some walls and roofs inside the establishment were put down. Broken windows were found up to 300 metres away. Road traffic around the establishment was prohibited for some hours. The water to the water treatment plant of Bari Sud, connected with the Chimica d'Agostino factory, reached a low pH (about 3.5) and returned to pH=7 after the intervention of fire brigade in diluting the liquid acid on the ground with water.","CAUSES:It seems that, during the unloading of nitric acid from a road tanker, by mistake, the operator connected the tanker with the wrong tank, i.e. he emptied the nitric acid into a tank containing formic acid. The mixing of the two acids produced a rapid exothermic reaction that led to the explosion of the tank followed by the release of a cloud with a yellow/red colour. Under these hypotheses the tank explosion could be explained because the reaction between the formic acid (a reducing substance) and the nitric acid (a strong oxidizing substance) is very rapid and highly exothermic and leads to the formation of water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The operator's error in the unloading operation was caused by an inadequate training/instruction together with an insufficient operating procedures (code 5303).","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 1 person was killed and 4 people injured by the explosion. Three firemen were hospitalized because of a probable intoxication during emergency operations.MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion seriously damaged some tanks. Some buildings inside the establishment suffered extensive damages. Outside the installation the windows were broken up to 300 metres away. No data are available about the cost of the material damages.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The road traffic around the establishment was prohibited for some hours.

The storage facility had not been declared to be a Seveso establishment, but the materials found after the accident prove that it actually fell under the scope of the Directive.The gravity of the accident is 3 on the international scale (according to the criterion based on the number of injured persons: 3; according to the criterion based on the on-site material damage: 3).37 members of the fire department were involved in the emergency operations, and 7 of them had to be hospitalised and kept under observation. The criteria in Annex VI are not strictly fulfilled as to the duration of hospitalisation. However, this accident is interesting from the point of view of the lessons that it provides on the subject of the management of storage facility fires (cf. paragraph ""Immediate Lessons Learned""). This type of establishment may contain, sometimes infringing the regulations, quantities of certain products which justify their classification as Seveso establishments.The accident:The fire broke out while 1999-storm damage repair work was being performed on the roof of the building with a torch.Some employees used fire fighting hoses from the on-site fire-fighting equipment against the fire. Within 20 minutes the fire propagated to the 3 units belonging to the operator, via the roof and the existing openings in the walls. The partial collapse of a dividing wall made of breeze blocks allows the propagation of the fire to crop protection products and to animal foods stock belonging to a logistics company associated to the operator. The smoke affected 37 members of the fire brigade, 7 of whom were hospitalised under observation. The extinguishing water (1,500 m3), contaminated with fertilisers and herbicides, detergents, and soaps, collected in a non-hermetic storm basin, threatening to pollute some drinking water catchments.Requisitioning measures were taken to ensure quick drainage and storage of the contaminated water for later treatment. The fire was put under control about 2 hours after its start. The building was partly preserved due to the means deployed by the emergency response services.","On 1 August 2000, an initial fire occurred around 11:30 in the bales of cellulose watting stored in one of the cells, which is used by one of the tenants as a workshop for the production of paper for sanitary use, cloths and napkins. This fire is a consequence of works carried out with welding torches on the roof of the building.The accident may have been caused by human error, i.e. an error of the workers on the roof, or by an inadequate preparation of the works by the building's owners, or by both factors. The exact causes are unknown.","The smoke affected 37 members of the fire brigade, 7 of whom were hospitalised under observation. Approximately 1,500 m# of the extinguishing water collected in a non-hermetic storm basin downstream from the site threatening to pollute the water table and some drinking water catchments of Marly-La-Ville.The earth of the reservoir has to be classified as polluted and the rainwater network is tainted. The stored products damaged by the fire were still being kept in the cells at the time of this report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding solutions for the treatment of the polluted waters constituted one major consequence of the accident. Besides the high costs of the operations, legal and administrative procedures had to be engaged, and the treatment of the polluted water had to be scheduled over a period of 11 months.On 4th August 2000 the Prefect of Val d'Oise requested the operators responsible for the products involved in the fire to dispose of the extinguishing water collected in the Marly-La-Ville storm basin within 24 hours. Faced with the refusal of the 2 operators, the Prefect issued a requisitioning order on 5th August 2000 under the terms of the Acts of July 22nd 1987 and July 11th 1938 concerning:- the requisitioning of pumping and transport equipment of a specialised company;- the requisitioning of facilities needed to store the extinguishing water until treatment, consisting in the leaching tank of the Asni&egrave;re-sur-Oise treatment plant (800 m#) and the aeration tank of a class 2 technical burial centre (700 m#);- the monitoring of the water table by setting up 2 piezometers downstream the nearby drinking water catchment station.The treatment cost of the polluted water is estimated between 1.07 and 1.2 M euros (1.070.000 and 1.200.000 euros)and is mainly due to the equipment immobilisation cost of the requisitioned companies.","Some employees used fire fighting hoses from the on-site fire-fighting equipment against the fire. Within 20 minutes the fire propagated to the 3 units belonging to the operator, via the roof and the existing openings in the walls. The partial collapse of a dividing wall made of breeze blocks allowed&nbsp; the propagation of the fire to crop protection products and to animal foods stock belonging to a logistics company associated to the operator. The smoke affected 37 members of the fire brigade, 7 of whom were hospitalised under observation. The extinguishing water (1,500 m3), contaminated with fertilisers and herbicides, detergents, and soaps, collected in a non-hermetic storm basin, threatening to pollute some drinking water catchments.Requisitioning measures were taken to ensure quick drainage and storage of the contaminated water for later treatment. The fire was put under control about 2 hours after its start. The building was partly preserved due to the means deployed by the emergency response services.","The rapid spread of the fire to a cell occupied by a third party shows that it is important to verify the applicability of construction regulations and adapt them to the specific conditions of the site. The presence of arsenic derivatives in amounts above the thresholds defined in the SEVESO Directive makes the monitoring of the inventory and its risk assessment mandatory.The pollution of the storm drain threatening the water table justifies the need for a hermetic extinguishing water retention pond. Each operator should construct a retention basin or each category of activity should at least have a retention pond at its disposal.In this specific case of a platform operated by different companies, responsibilities were difficult to determine and this caused a significant delay in implementing measures intended for an efficient emergency response.Law suits and administrative recourse have significantly complicated and slowed down the resolution of the pollution problem."
153,273,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Explosion during the filling of a tank truck with nitrous oxide,2001-07-02 09:00:00,2001-07-02 11:00:00,An explosion occurred during the filling of a tank truck with nitrous oxide. The explosion resulted in a fire.,"The explosion was caused by an explosive decomposition of nitrous oxide vapour in the tank. The decomposition of the vapour was initiated by the shaft of one of the pumps of the road tanker, which had overheated in one of its bearings. The decomposition must have propagated through the piping system to the tank. The main reason for overheating was the lack of cooling due to inadequate filling with liquid nitrous oxide. Due to inadequate working instructions it is well possible that the pumps were inadequately cooled before they were started. As a result, the pumps were filled with gaseous nitrous oxide.","Eleven employees, among whom the driver of the truck, suffered minor injuries as a result of projected debris.The company and several buildings in the area sustained heavy damage. Windows in the area were broken.
Material Loss:Damage to buildings both on and off-site runs in the millions (euros).Community Disruption:Police and fire brigade evacuated 12 companies, several houses and a building for vocational training. Employees, residents and students were sheltered in a nearby sports hall. They were allowed to return to their offices and houses around 11.00.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","Police and fire brigade evacuated 12 companies, several houses and a building for vocational training. Employees, residents and students were sheltered in a nearby sports hall. They were allowed to return after the fire brigade had extinguished the fire.Official action taken - other official action: Investigation into the causes was conducted. Before the company resumes its activitites, it has to consult with the competent authorities to demonstrate that sufficient action has been taken to prevent recurrence.Seveso II duties  - remarks: The company had submitted its
notification only a few days before the explosion. The safety
organisation has not been evaluated as a whole during the
investigation. Interview with the truck driver indicates that he
followed the specified procedure for loading the tank, except for not
flushing the vapour return system. Evaluation of the specified
procedure for loading shows that the instructions are not very
detailed. It is possible that the pumps were not sufficiently cooled
before the filling procedure started. Furthermore, instruction to truck
drivers is given only once. As the working instructions are not
sufficiently detailed, variations in the way procedures are being
followed are possible. During training not all dangers of nitrous oxide
were taken into account. The possibility of explosive decomposition of
nitrous oxide is not mentioned on the safety information sheet.","Measures to prevent recurrence: Measures have to be taken to prevent overheating of the pump. Several options are possible. Furthermore, flame arrestors should be placed around the pump. Procedures and education of employees needs improvement. Systematic risk analysis is required.Useful references: A similar event took place in 1980 in the USA: Mattrey, J.F.

154,500,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Release of flammable substances which ignited from a petrol hydrotreatment unit (HDH) in a refinery,2002-11-17 20:23:00,2002-11-17 01:00:00,"The accident was caused by the release of flammable substances which ignited from a petrol hydrotreatment unit (HDH) in a refinery. The accident was notified because of the cost of the damage to facilities (4.3 MEuros). It was classified level 3 of the scale, as published&nbsp; in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso directive,&nbsp; in accordance with that criterion.The accident:A leak occurred at the reboiler seal surface, on the hot fluid side, and immediately ignited causing an almost vertical plume of flame a dozen metres long.The purpose of the reboiler is to provide the energy necessary for the column to operate. The column consists of the pre-treatment stripper, depending on the hydrotreatment unit. It is a preparation phase for the reformer input. The reboiling energy is provided by the output from the reformer.The sequence of events:The settings (pressure and associated throughputs) on the two circuits, analysed after the accident, show that the leak occurred on the hot fluid side (thus containing output from the reformer). The description of the sequence of events is as follows:&nbsp;- 20h23:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire started,- 20h25:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West units called to the fire. Site siren triggered.- 20h30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire-fighters left - Emergency stop of the reformer - closure of shut-off valves due to fault - Start of decompression of the unit - gas sent to the flare- 20h32:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand-by management called and home phone connection made (stage 1)- 20h34:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand-by management called and home phone connection made (stage 2)- 20h50:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head of safety/security arrives.- 20h55:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nangis fire brigade arrives (1 fire engine +5 crew) tasked with installing a second cannon on the west side.- 20h56:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Departmental fire and rescue service called to report the sending of reinforcements- 21h00:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mormant fire brigade arrives (5 fire-fighters) tasked with preparing two 1,000 l/min fire hoses.- 21h10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A carpet of foam laid down.- 21h11:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water curtain with cannon to the West of the area on fire- 21h35:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deviation set up by the police on the RN19 trunk road- 21h45:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-positioning of a 4th canon, which was not used.- 23h21:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire put out and 3 cannons stopped - 2 cannons were kept in place for a time either side of the unit.- 23h25:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deviation on the RN 19 trunk road ceased- 23h30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire-fighters stood down - Facilities inerted with nitrogen.- 1h00:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End of emergency.As regards the offsite emergency response services, the fire brigade was called by motorists passing the site. Subsequently, 20 fire engines were parked in front of the refinery, as the refinery only authorised 2 fire engines to enter the site, for safety reasons. The 18 fire engines thus waited off-site until the emergency was over.","According to the initial findings and reports, the leak was due to a fault originating in the exchanger which had a dimensional concentricity defect in the throat of the seal housing. This had caused problems with the work of reassembling the unit while stopped for maintenance prior to the accident. It was because the different parts were incorrectly seated.The seal, obtained by cold tightening the metal parts onto one another, gave way during the run-up to high temperatures. The accident thus occurred during this transition phase.","The accident resulted in one slight injury: one of the members of the fire crew injured his back while setting up the water cannons.

There was considerable property damage: damage to the facility amounted to 4.3 Meuros. Furthermore, the main units affected (hydrogen processing and reforming) were shut down for several weeks. Lastly, because of the significant damage, the technical refurbishment and mitigation plan for the area affected resulted to be massive. The cost of business interruption came to 1.7 Meuros.


","As regards fire-fighting operations, see the sequence of events paragraph in chapter 3 (Immediate Source(s) of Accident).In addition to the repairs recommended by an organisation expert in metallurgy, the operator finally implemented a programme to refurbish the affected section in accordance with the recommendations of the American standard ""API RP 570 - section 11 - Assessment of fire damage"".In particular, the following actions were taken:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mapping the sectors affected,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refurbishment procedure including a visual inspection, ultrasonic thickness tests, hardness tests and making replicas for metallographic tests -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Replacing the pressure relief valves in the section,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Servicing valves in the section.","The main points are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There was no UVCE (Unconfined Vapour Cloud Explosion) because the product was already at a temperature higher than its flash point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It was possible to limit damage due to the fact that the heat resisting lines and reactors did not fail, in spite of the low flow rate of the charge within vessels and pipework, the flow of the charge being&nbsp; an essential element for cooling the equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Because of the position of water curtains, the fire did not spread.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The positioning of the curtains was sensible as regards the vertical position of the plume: This was because the choice of siting of the cannons prevented any domino effect which there could well have been in view of the configuration of the site (units separated by bays about fifteen metres wide).Technical issues: improvements to limit the consequences of a similar leak are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Increase of the decompression speed of the reactor section of the reformer by changing a gas venting valve to an oil-gas system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Modification of a pressure relief valve currently operated at a pressure threshold, it will now be controllable from the control room console.Organisational issues: the operator has implemented dimensional inspection procedures for seal seats in exchangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Special approval is now required for personnel undertaking this type of work, with the corresponding appropriate training,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - For outside contractors doing this type of work, the introduction of routine dimensional inspection reports on the seal seats and stop points are scheduled after upgrading, before finalising assembly and during reassembly."

The explosion, triggering a domino effect involving other drums and bags containing hazardous chemical products present in the hangar, caused the collapse of the hangar due to the pressure wave. The collapse of the structure caused the death of the operator crushed by the debris. The pressure wave injured a second operator who was hospitalised and dismissed in the evening. The pressure wave damaged also the adjoining solids storage hangar, causing the collapse of part of the structure, and ignited some small fires due to spark projection. The fire brigade declared that a mushroom cloud developed having initially a clear colour (presumably deriving from dust generated by the collapsing hangar) and then changed into black smoke deriving from the combustion of the chemical products,Activation of the onsite emergency response plan and immediate intervention of the external fire brigade teams from different command posts of the province of Varese and other provinces.

Peracetic acid can cause an explosive reaction when getting into contact with sodium chlorite (CAS 7758-19-2).According to the NIOSH Material Data Safety Sheet sodium chlorite decomposes at 180-200°C producing toxic and corrosive fumes. It could be assumed that the sodium chlorite decomposed due to the initial violent exothermic reaction with the acid and then by the high temperature reached by the initial explosive reaction. The company declared that 30 t of sodium chlorite were destroyed by the accident, representing the entire quantity stored.The company admitted the presence of a 1000 l storage tank of peracetic acid at 15% outside of the storage hangar, - the tank was found damaged in proximity of the collapsed hangar,&nbsp; arguing further that the presence of peracetic acid in the explosion point could be justified by the extinguishing water used by the fire brigades.On the other hand all elements collected by ARPA indicate non correct management procedures of hazardous materials inside the storage facility.These statements are however still to be evaluated in the judicial procedure which is still in process.","1 fatality1 person injuredOnsite material damage-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;structural damages to hangar A, partial collapse of the structure, destruction of the electrical supply system, destruction of 3 forklifts, loss of almost all chemicals stored in the hangar, destruction of sulphur acid dilution equipment, damages to the adjoining office building,&nbsp; etc--&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Estimated material damage 3.200.000 EUR of which 810.000 EUR of loss of stored productsOffsite material damageNo offsite material damage caused by the pressure wave of the explosionEnvironmental damageConcentration of hazardous substances in the air-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;no relevant concentrations (mainly ammonia and cyanidric acid) were detected offsite while monitoring during and after the accident-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ammonia 30 ppm 15 m from the explosion point, 2 ppm at the limits of the site-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cyanidric acid , 1 - 2 ppm 15 m from the explosion point, 0,3 ppm at the limits of the site-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while onsite the use of filter-masks was needed during 48 hours.","Onsite Emergency ResponseIntervention of onsite emergency team, evacuatiion of the personnel of the entire establishment, use of fire monitors and other extinguishing means (powder, CO2 etc) waiting for the intervention of the public fire brigades.

On the DCS trend there’s a minor decrease of pressure.An operator wants to release the pressure via drain on ground level, but notices the system is pressureless. The operator repeats pressure test and asks the panel operator to check the pressure again.Again the measurements are OK. However, this time the operator doesn’t open the drain on the supply line but he opens a drain on the inlet of the radiant section. Air is released. Pressure loss test is considerred OK.Pressuretest erroneously executed: Downstream the feed valves a check valve is installed in the direction of the furnace convection section. The open vent valve is upstream on the top platform of these check valves. The pressure measurements, used for the pressure loss test are downstream the check valves. The check valves have caused that the pressure remained on the system downstream the check valves. The system upstream of the check valves with the open vent valve had become pressureless straight away. The operator has performed in this case a leak test on a pressureless system. Start-up of cracker – 5/07: Furnace is deblinded. Oven is starting to heat up. Steam flows through the supply line for 20h and also passes the open vent.

",Vent was closed.No further response needed.," Pressure loss test was inadequately executed because of the checkvalves affecting the pressure measurements, therefore the open vent remained undetected so long.Use the schemes (P&ID’s, flagsheets) in order to better execute pressure loss tests and by using them you can also take all the alignments in account.Punching/Check-up of the alignment before start-up has been qualitatively insufficient executed.Full check-up of alignment including stop & caps is always necessary.The checklist for start-up was not respected, not checked nor used. The importance and necessity of these checklists need to be more clear for everyone in the future.The standard check-rounds ought to reveal abnormal situations relatively fast. In this case, they were insufficiently executed.Planned actions by the company:General sensitization to underline the importance and necessity of being alert and thorough during the execution of the following:Correct use of checklistsPerforming check-roundsStops & capsCheck all the alignments of the air pressure tests with the corresponding schemes (Pl&D’s, flowsheets) and have them double-checked by someone else.Update procedure of leak testing and add this incident as lesson learnt.Implement holdpoints in checklists before starting up the NC3 furnaces.

157,1097,Major Accident,"Fuel storage (including heating, retail sale, etc.)",Fire in two hydrocarbon storage tanks following a malicious act,2015-07-14 03:00:00,2015-07-14 15:00:00,"Two explosions occurred at around 3.00 a.m. in a storage tank farm at a petrochemical complex: two tanks were on fire and their floating roofs damaged. The first contained 11,300 m³ of pyrolysis gasoline (fractions C5 to C9). The second, 300 m away, contained 48,000 m³ of naphtha (light hydrocarbon fractions). The in-house firefighters, supported by the teams from neighbouring plants, intervened in large number. The operator launched the internal emergency plan and alerted the emergency services. A large plume of black smoke was visible at dawn for several kilometres.
At 11.00 a.m. the next day, an examination of the floating roof of an adjacent tank containing 25,000&nbsp;m³ of condensate found an ignition system and a 4&nbsp;m² breach in the centre of the roof. The partially submerged roof had not sunk and there was still a risk of ignition.","The investigation’s initial findings suggested a malicious act, given that the explosions had occurred at the same time and that ignition systems were found close to the affected tanks and on the roof of the third tank. Damage worth millions of euro was caused. One year later, a suspect who appears to have acted alone was charged and remanded in custody as part of an investigation for wilful destruction of property using explosives and transport of explosives, charges for which the suspect risked 10 years in prison.","While the damaged tanks and their berms were being emptied, the evaporation of hydrocarbons from them caused local air pollution with VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) for around ten days.
The air quality monitoring association measured peak pollutant concentrations (BTEX, ozone) in the nearby town of Berre starting the next day. Two days after the accident, local residents complained about hydrocarbon smells, headaches and irritations to the eyes, throat and nose.
Following the measures taken to reduce the pollution, these concentrations dropped during the 7&nbsp;days after the accident, then fell markedly from the 8th day while still remaining above local averages.
The follow-up involved securing the tanks and limiting the impact on the soil/sub-soil, air and water. Various steps were taken, including emptying, degassing, skimming and ventilating the tanks. Their integrity was then verified.
As for environmental protection measures, the polluted earth (between 0.5 ha and 2 ha) was dug up. In order to limit air pollution, a foam layer was put in place on each of the two tanks. A boom to prevent pollution was also laid at the outfall into the &Eacute;tang de Berre lagoon. The readings on exit from the treatment plant stayed normal. The findings of monitoring of the groundwater to the south-east of the site revealed supernatants in the piezometer wells and high BTEX concentrations in certain locations. The pollution from the accident may have exacerbated pre-existing pollution in that area. On the 14th day after the accident, supernatants appeared in a spring around 100 metres from the tank farm, outside the site. These were pumped and treated.","The authorities set up a crisis response team at 5.35 a.m. The security forces closed a motorway exit for 7 hours. The two departmental roads leading to the site were closed for 12.5 hours. Access to the tank farm was restricted.
The fire brigade reached the surroundings of the site at around 3.40 a.m. with 120 firefighters and 64 fire engines. Their intervention in support of the site’s firefighters began at around 7.30 a.m. Taking water from the nearby lagoon, six 1.8 km long hoses fed one high-powered foam fire engine and three foam units.
Putting out the fire in the first tank (gasoline) was prioritised. The fire in that tank was extinguished at 4.35 a.m. after a massive foam attack by the site’s firefighters. A foam layer was maintained until 12.00 p.m. Work to extinguish the second tank (naphtha) began at 6.20 a.m. and ended at 11.15 a.m. A foam layer was maintained until 3.00 p.m. Its floating roof sank 48 hours later. The structure of the two tanks stayed intact. The external emergency services departed the site at around 8.30 p.m. 170&nbsp;m³ of foam was used.","In the light of this event and the one in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier (ARIA 46767), a meeting between the minister for the environment and several industrial firms was held on 17 July 2015 to examine the issue of malicious acts. The minister for the environment announced that Seveso establishments would be inspected in this connection before the end of 2015."
158,1142,Near Miss,Chemical installations ,Release of sulphur compounds at a reaction furnace of a carbon disulphide plant,2018-08-22 22:10:00,2018-08-22 22:10:00,"A pipe cracked in reaction furnace 1 of the carbon disulphide (CS2) plant. As a result, natural gas, sulphur and carbon disulphide were burned and sulphur dioxide released.As a result, natural gas, sulphur and carbon disulphide were released at a pressure of approximately 6 bar into the furnace fired with natural gas burners and burned there. As a result of the pressure increase in reaction furnace 1, flames were emitted for a short period of time. These caused damage to wiring and also led to a shutdown of reaction furnace 2. The released substances burned up in the reaction furnace and sulphur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and small quantities of CS2 were released into the air via the reaction furnace’s tall chimney. Due to wind conditions (wind direction from WNW, 1.4 m/s), the gas cloud moved towards the Rhine. Complaints were received by the fire brigade from residents on the right bank of the Rhine.Safety measures:Due to the drop in pressure in the reaction tubes, the supply of raw materials was stopped by the automatic closure of the valves. The furnace was shut down in a controlled manner under established conditions. The affected parts of the plant concerned were then rinsed.","The tubes in the reaction furnaces are subject to sulphidisation, a special form of high temperature corrosion. This cannot be avoided in this process, as past investigations have shown.The examination of this event by an expert approved under Section 29b of the ""Federal Immission Control Act” (BlmSchG - Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz), and in particular the examination of the materials, has shown that the existing technical method for measuring the wall thickness of the furnace pipes and its implementation has led to misinterpretations.Technical issues: Sufficient recording of sulphidisation by a measurement method.","Reaction furnaceCosts: &euro;465,000Odour nuisance (approx. 20 people affected) caused by a sulphurous smell or hydrogen sulphide in two districts of Cologne on the right bank of the Rhine, 6-7 km from the upstream source of emissions.","Controlled burning of the reaction tube contents and rinsing of the system.The small-scale localised fire was extinguished directly by the staff trained as first responders. No further fire brigade intervention was required.Outside the site, air measurements were carried out by the professional fire brigade of the city of Cologne in the districts where the odour complaints arose. The substances released could not be detected. Moreover, by the time the professional fire brigade arrived, no smell could any longer be detected.Repair of reaction furnace 1 in consultation with an expert organisation approved in accordance with Section 29a of the ""Federal Immission Control Act” (BlmSchG - Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz) and the competent authority.",Precautionary replacement of reaction tubes in the other similar furnaces.A new technical procedure including a redesigned test was drawn up for measuring the wall thickness of the process tubes in the furnaces. The method has been tested to ensure that it is suitable for measuring the thickness of the wall. The test intervals and test points have been redefined. The process is being integrated into the existing management system and regularly validated as part of the management system’s requirements. Staff performing wall thickness measurements are regularly trained on the implementation of the new procedure. This staff training is documented.The main purpose of improving measurement technology is to prevent incidents.Additional shut-off devices are being automated on the basis of a systematic hazard analysis.Existing agreements with the emergency services will be fleshed out.
159,1330,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Release of phosgene,2022-01-25 21:00:00,2022-01-25 21:15:00,"At the time of the serious accident, the concerned phosgene production unit was out of service, under vacuum, and contained no phosgene. In the meantime, phosgene production was in progress in other similar units. The concerned unit was connected to the ongoing phosgene production through a pipeline. That pipeline connection was blocked with a paddle blind, that had been placed between the flanges under the remote-operated pneumatic ball valve.
By management's decision, the paddle blind had to be removed. The task was carried out by a system operator and a trainee system operator (later became victim), supervised by the shift supervisor.&nbsp;
Before the work, they checked that the unit was under vacuum, and no phosgene was present. After loosening the bolts connecting the flanges, the paddle blind could only be partially removed, it was stuck between the flanges.&nbsp;
While he tried to remove the stuck paddle blind without a proper tool, the trainee system operator unintentionally displaced a test screw on the&nbsp;remote-operated pneumatic valve and opened it partially.&nbsp;This resulted in a phosgene release.
The trainee system operator used an air-purifying respirator instead of the required compressed air breathing apparatus. The toxic gas immediately got through the filter of the air-purifying respirator, causing the trainee system operator to inhale, also contaminate his workwear.&nbsp;
They immediately rushed to the control room, where the shift supervisor instructed the system operators to shut down the technology.&nbsp;
Afterward, the shift supervisor checked the status of this pneumatic ball valve on the PLC screen.&nbsp; It displayed failure while receiving a closing command.
The trainee system operator, apart from coughing, appeared to be in a good condition. Also, he verified that he is not feeling unwell.
At the establishment, there was a 7/24 emergency service (local firefighter brigade and first aid service). In the control room, the system operators and the shift supervisor questioned the trainee system operator if he needed first aid, but he did not request it, so they did not notify the emergency service.
By the end of the shift (at 23:00) and on his way home, the trainee system operator was feeling better. Soon after arriving home, however, his condition deteriorated significantly. The shift supervisor pick him up and took him to the hospital. After a medical examination, he was admitted to the intensive care unit, where he died in the early hours of the morning.
&nbsp;","The direct cause of the release:&nbsp;
The workers were attempting to remove the stuck paddle blind without the proper tools. This could have caused the accidental movement that opened the valve.
Further, indirect causes of the release:&nbsp;

responsibility for ordering and carrying out maintenance tasks was not clearly defined,
the victim, as a trainee, did not have the necessary education to carry out the task,
system operators were performing a maintenance task on their own for which they were not explicitly authorised to perform, nor had they received the necessary training,
the deputation rules were not properly defined so there was no accountable manager onsite on the day of the accident .

Causes leading to injury and subsequent death:

not using the personal respiratory protective equipment prescribed in the working procedures and work order form: instead of the prescribed compressed air breathing apparatus the use of purifying respirator protection offered less protection,
the shift supervisor, as the victim’s direct leader, did not follow the prescriptions for the use of appropriate protective equipment and did not call the victim to account to follow either,
failure to provide first aid by neglecting to notify the emergency service, as prescribed by the internal rules in the event of an injury,
failure to notify the relevant management (including the head of the EHS division) in time, contrary to the internal regulations (blocking the possibility of medical treatment on the instructions of a senior manager),
failure to implement immediate decontamination of the workwear.

Further causes:

training deficiency: documents do not show that the victim received all the required lessons (only basic recruits' training is documented),
inadequate training topics: training for recruits do not sufficiently cover plant-specific risks and how to prevent them,
no procedure for the replacement of used filter cartridges for purifying respirator protection: inadequate document management,
inadequate first aid: no oxygen-assisted breathing device was used to support the ethanol inhalation,
responsibilities, competencies, and deputising rules were not clearly defined.
&nbsp;

","
1 person deceased
no other injuries
0.4 kg phosgene was released, so the concentration of the substance was only localised and there were no other consequences
","There was no intervention by the establishment's local fire brigade or other emergency services.&nbsp;
The fact of accidental opening of the valve was not discovered on the spot (happened at 21:02) and was therefore not blocked. The workers left the working area in a hurry.&nbsp;
As an immediate measure, the&nbsp;shift supervisor instructed the system operators to shut down the technology&nbsp;(closing the chlorine and carbon-monoxide valves, and setting the blowdown to 100%).&nbsp;
The&nbsp;shift supervisor&nbsp;and the other system operator went back to the working area where they completed the paddle blind removal (they already had a crowbar, so they succeeded).&nbsp;
They realised that the remote-operated pneumatic valve was partially opened. Afterward, the shift supervisor checked the status of this pneumatic ball valve on the PLC screen. It displayed failure while receiving a closing command.
The valve was then closed remotely. The closed stage was displayed at 21:15 on the screen.&nbsp;
The installed gas detection system detected phosgene presence from 21:00 to 21:05.
After the accident, neither the shift supervisor nor the system operators notified the emergency service, which would have been mandatory by the regulations. They neither notified the relevant managers - except one person, the plant engineer (who has been called at 21:55). The plant engineer, who was at home, also did not notify other managers or the emergency service. The relevant managers were not informed of the accident until the next morning, at the beginning of the shift.&nbsp;
The trainee system operator, apart from coughing, appeared to be in a good condition. Also, he verified that he is not feeling unwell. In the control room, the system operators and the shift supervisor questioned the trainee system operator if he needed first aid, but he did not request it, so they did not notify the emergency service.
As a basic treatment,&nbsp;the trainee system operator&nbsp;was continuously inhaling ethanol, but the available oxygen respiratory support device was not used. Professional medical treatment started too late, and hours later the contamination.
&nbsp;","After investigating the causes, the operator took the following measures:

a trainee worker should not work in the presence of a toxic gas until becomes confident in carrying out tasks in a safe condition,
out-of-turn training for workers,
out-of-turn inspection of the relevant valve and process unit,
review of the occupational risk assessment,
review and modification of various training courses,
review of internal written procedures and instructions:

responsibilities and competencies,&nbsp;
operating procedures,&nbsp;
maintenance procedures,
deputising procedures,&nbsp;
personal protective equipment allocation,
first aid rules.

One person was injured in the accident, and the production facilities and equipment were destroyed. The investigation concluded that a probable chain of events was that solvent vapors rose close to the ceiling where there was no adequate ventilation. The vapor ignited when a worker opened a vertical lift door. To avoid similar accidents in the future, the investigative team recommends that adequate ventilation is ensured in plants that handle solvents and gases.","On the day of the accident the plant was operating as usual. The workers had not detected anything out of the normal.
The source of the leak could not be identified with certainty. It is deemed probable that due to inadequate ventilation solvent vapours or flammable gas accumulated in the upper parts of the building. Ignition was probably caused by the stopping mechanism of the vertical lift door, static electricity or an electrical appliance. According to the workers inside the building, the indoor gas detectors did not sound an alarm before the accident.","An explosive gas mixture ignited when a worker opened a vertical lift door from the outside. A pressure wave broke lightweight concrete blocks in the exterior wall, and doors and windows were thrown out into the yard. A worker was injured due to the pressure release. The acetone mixture and LPG pipelines were damaged which resulted in a flammable liquid and gas release into the production facilities.This caused that the fire developed rapidly inside the building.",Areal fire brigade arrived on site 10 minutes after alarm. They managed to limit the fire at production areas. Fire was extinguished using foam. Water was used to protect LPG tanks and storage building nearby.,"Technology related recommendations:

Adequacy of ventilation must be monitored regularly
Pressure relief must be designed and carried out so that the buildup of pressure cannot cause collapse of structures or buildings, or damage to pipelines
There must be enough gas detectors in facilities where explosive mixtures may be present
Alarms from gas detectors must be detectable in all places where workers may be in danger and near entrance doors.
Vertical lift doors are not suitable as emergency exits
The amount of hazardous chemicals in the production facilities should be limited to be as low as possible (e.g. the needs of one shift).
It is recommended to attach the gas alarm to the safety automation system, e.g. to de-energize electrical equipment and close valves

Recommendations related to organizational activities:

Tasks that are meant to ensure safety must be identified, as well as workers who are responsible for the execution of these tasks
The management must supervise that these tasks are carried out
The company must be aware of the legislation that regulates its activities
The company must systematically monitor how the implementation of demands and recommendations from authorities are carried out
Systematic maintenance must be carried out. Records must be kept of all implemented maintenance activities
The workers must be trained to work safely, and they must be told about the plant’s hazards. Temporary workers must also be trained.
The company must inform the supervising authority when changes are made that concern the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals.

2. It is recommended to consider whether there is a need to improve heat/cold insulation and possibly install heating cable/steam follower pipes on standpipe for level measurement. It is recommended to make similar assessments in other facilities/equipment if freezing could potentially occur and if this could have serious consequences.
3. Factories should address, on the shifts, the importance of analysing and assessing abnormal sounds, vibrations and movements in process equipment. Possible criteria for stopping a factory/factory section should be discussed locally and if appropriately defined.
4. It is recommended to keep track of people working on electronic work permits on paper. This will provide quick access to data for these individuals, regardless of access to the electronic work permit system.
5. It is recommended that those issuing work permits focus on and facilitate that work permits are parked when they are not being worked on. By parking is meant that a system has been created, which is known, where the performer must report that the work has been paused.
6. In the event of future incidents, efforts must be made to achieve an efficient flow of information that ensures that emergency preparedness is informed as quickly as possible of potentially exposed or injured persons.

The fire occurred the day production had been shut down for the annual holiday closure of the establishment. The excavated area (50x30m) was partly surrounded by a protection wall and, protected by fire extinguishing tower and had only one access. All pyrotechnic waste materials could only be transferred to the incineration area after authorisation given the safety and environmental protection service. The waste materials of the company and/or other companies were transported to the area soaked in water. It was necessary to reduce the water content in the waste materials up to a certain degree in order to proceed with burning , this operation was performed by adding powder charges to the waste pyrotechnic materials. Before incineration in the excavated area., waste material was placed in a string disposition on pallets The presence of a specially adapted fire extinguishing vehicle was mandatory for burning large quantities of waste materials. On 24/07/2006, the powder ignited spontaneously while the operator working since 1987 in the burning area was preparing the area with an agricultural tractor. The worker under shock could leave the tractor without suffering injuries.On 28/07/2006 in the morning, the Safety and Environmental Protection service foreman, conscious about the extreme hazard represented by the stored waste materials decided to burn the waste materials.The foreman started to prepare the operation with the help of two workers of the production department (the two qualified workers of the Safety and Environmental Protection Service were absent).The waste materials (composed by humid finished gun powder and graphite) was to be placed on pellets, raked and spread on the pallets such to ease the drying process. On beginning of the afternoon they distributed 2 supplies of waste material in layers on the pellets in absence of the fire extinguishing vehicle. A spontaneously ignited fire started at about 15:00 hrs near to the foreman who remained imprisoned by the flames and the smoke. The two other workers succeeded to escape from the area without being injured. One of them a volunteer fire fighter triggered alarm and started to fight the fire. The foreman was found 30 m from the fire ignition point near the border of the retaining wall, he died within 1 hour due to the consequences of his injuries. The fire may have ignited due to friction of the powder (dry powder + polluted humid powder therefore more sensitive) caused by a falling/slipping pallet or by the foreman involuntarily stepping on a pallet. A disposable not functioning lighter was found near the ignition point. The production of the establishment will re-start after implementing compensatory measures. The company is also obliged to perform other studies, like on the soil pollution caused by the fire, kind and nature of the waste materials etc.The accident is notified, due to one fatality occurred (level 2 of the index ""human and social consequences"" of the European accident gravity scale - parameter H3)","The fire may have ignited due to friction of the powder (dry powder + polluted humid powder therefore more sensitive) caused by a falling/slipping pallet or by the foreman involuntarily stepping on a pallet.

Automatic shut-down of the power plant block (Block&nbsp;5) following the incident.","An independent damage analysis has been carried out pursuant to Section&nbsp;18(2) of the Industrial Safety Ordinance.
According to the analysis, the facility was in good working order.
The primary cause of the damage was identified as the failure of the casing on a boiler circulating pump. The fracture surfaces show a combination of fatigue and residual fractures.
The fatigue fracture surface showed lines of rest and ripples, which indicate that the cause of the material failure developed slowly. The fatigue fracture can be attributed to the construction of the flange in combination with the prevailing operating conditions, and the crack initiation to strain-induced corrosion cracking (SICC). There was no indication that the material of the pump covering was responsible for the damage.
According to the calculations used until this accident (in accordance with TRD), the shaft of the casing for the pump was regarded as a critical point and the actual site of the damage (next to the flange close to the circumferential groove) could not be predicted. In the regular tests carried out, crack formation and spread could not be determined.","Considerable damage to the boiler room (steel construction, pipes, components of the circulation system, electrical and control apparatus) and to a lesser extent to the turbine room.","– Automatic emergency shut-down of Block&nbsp;5.– On-site fire service alerted.– Darmstadt regional government emergency response centre informed immediately following the rupture of the pressure-bearing wall in the circulation system.– Securing of all components of the facility containing water-polluting substances.
Repair of Block&nbsp;5 with minor alterations from its original design (circulating pump casing with improved design, pipes of different diameter, and use of steel for the platform in the boiler room).","
VGB Powertech (association of power plant operators) was informed and a working group on boiler circulation systems was set up, in which other power plant operators and technical inspection associations participate.
The manufacturer of the circulating pump was informed and has altered the design of the circulating pump casing. The manufacturer has drawn up a list in order of priority identifying power plant operators with the same or similar circulating pumps and has written to them.
A change in the design of the pump casing with a considerably lower tension level and the implementation of a new testing approach has reduced the danger of another failure of the boiler circulating pump to a minimum. The formation of further cracks in the casing of the boiler circulating pump is almost ruled out, considering the new finite element method (FEM) calculations, and the future regular tests practically rule out the possibility of them spreading unnoticed.
In future, a mechanical phased array procedure (ultrasonic testing) will be used instead of a manual phased array procedure for the regular testing of the circulating pump casing.

A noise was heard by the shift personnel who then located the leak. The shift supervisor and an operator immediately put on personal air breathing apparatuses and went where the leakage occurred. The section of the circuit containing the leaking valve was isolated on the upstream by stopping the feeding pump and closing the block valve at the exchanger inlet and on the downstream by closing the first block valve after the exchanger outlet. The valve to the vacuum system was immediately opened to evacuate the product contained in the isolated section to the scrubber system. The plant was shut-down. Internal, intercompanies and fire department emergency plans were put into action. Neighbouring plants, fire department and hospital of Salreu were alerted. At 05:14 the leak was stopped.The accident occurred in the feeding circuit of the 70% phosgene solution in monochlorobenzene of a polymeric isocyanate production plant in an organic chemical industry. The plant is part of a chemical industry complex (4 factories) sited in a plane forest area, 1 km away from some houses and 3 km away from the nearest village.The polymeric isocyanate production used as starting materials: anyline, formaldehyde, hydrogen chloride, sodium hydroxide and carbonium chloride. The operating conditions in the feeding section of the 70% phosgene solution in monochlorobenzene were: pressure= 40 Bar and temperature= 135°C. At 05:10 the rupture of a purge valve, installed at the outlet of a heat exchanger for heating the phosgene solution, caused the release of a 70% phosgene solution in monochlorobenzene. A noise was heard by the shift personnel who then located the leak. The shift supervisor and an operator immediately put on personal air breathing apparatuses and went where the leakage occurred.

As soon as the gas warning sensors were triggered, the plant team immediately began to wind down the reactor using an elevated flare and to activate the reactor chamber's vapour barrier. Within 2-4 minutes, the alerted fire-brigade was on site and began cooling the lower third of the reactor area. As the leaking fluid (cyclopentene/cyclopentane) evaporates easily, instead of directly extinguishing the flames, the material was allowed to burn out in a controlled fashion. Around 15:30 the flames burned out in the reactor chamber and the residues from the process were burned with the elevated flare. The incident was confined to the reactor chamber. There was no harm to people or the environment. The material damages were concentrated on the reactor area, the compartmentation of which prevented the fire from spreading to other parts of the plant. At the time of the incident, there were around 40 t of a mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons in the reactor.
Around 10% of the mixture (rough estimate) leaked out through a break point caused by the explosion and was burnt.
","Operation-associated: the final conclusion is that the ignition of a detonatable mixture and probably very small amounts of air led to a detonation in the area of the block and bleed system in the dispensing equipment. Adiabatic compression of gas is seen as the possible cause of the ignition. The day before the incident (15 November 2010), a block valve on the reactor side was replaced. During its installation air probably got into the pipe section between the block valve on the reactor side and a second block valve, and the pipeline between the block valve on the reactor side and a control valve was probably then filled with cyclopentene (CPen) residue in gas or liquid form. This means that before the start of the nitrous oxide dosing, the relevant pipe section probably had a mixture of CPen residues and air of an unknown composition. The accident investigation concluded that the ignition of an explosive mix of nitrous oxide, cyclopentene/cyclopentane and probably very small quantities of air led to an explosion in the area of the block and bleed system of the nitrous oxide dosing of the CPon plant sector. There were also comprehensive investigations to determine the source of ignition as the potential trigger for the explosion. In two points, adiabate compression following the opening of the nitrous oxide valves could have created local hotspots. Adiabatic compression is considered as the possible cause of the ignition. No individual person actively made a mistake. The relatively new process, which is still being patented, and the low level of knowledge about the substances or mixture properties, particularly the mass explosiveness of nitrous oxide / cyclopentene mixtures is considered as the cause.

At 08:00 four people started to work in the storage installation and, at 08:30, everything was normal. Some smoke was noticed by the storage personnel at about 09:15 am. The first reaction of the personnel was to use, unsuccessfully, portable fire extinguishers until the fire brigade intervened even if visible fire was never noticed. At 09:43 a 3 vehicle team arrived on-site and, after assessment of the situation, immediately requested a reinforcement with foam equipments. Fire fighting operations proceeded with difficulty owing to the jellow/red smoke cloud which had developped. The first attempt of the firemen was to isolate the ammonium nitrate in compartment No 5 from the compartment involved in the fire by means of water curtains. At 10:30 the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident and at 11:15 preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started (shelter information to the public by vehicles with loudspeakers, telephone calls to town halls and through TV and local radio stations). At the same time, the number of fire fighting equipments was increased involving all the nearby safety centres and continuous monitoring of cloud movements by means of a helicopter and metereological indications given by the Nantes station were carried out (the concentrations of main pollutants [nitric acid, nitrogen oxides and ammonia] inside and outside the storehouse and at nearby communities as a function of time are available in the Original Report and the in relevant presentation in the Seminar on ""The Notification of Major Accidents"" held at Rethymnon Greece on October 6/7 in 1988). The toxic cloud reached an height of about 250m and was 5km large and it was covering a surface of about 15 km. At 11:30 the rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. At 13:00 nitric acid concentrations of 5ppm were measured by the Nantes cell up to Coueron. The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. At 13:50 a request to the army for assistance with vehicles was made. At 14:00 the Mobile Chemical Action Cell of Angers was asked for help and for a reserve of isolating respirators. At 14:15 the ORSEC plan was activated and at 14:30 the decision to evacuate was made. Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers. Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people. During this period of time the products on fire were soaked with a total flow of 700m3/h. The fire was almost extinguished at 14:15 but emission of smoke was reduced considerably at 16:00 while reinforcement from other departments continued to arrive. At 17:20 the Prefect gave a Press Conference and at 18:00 a survey on the percentage evacuation achieved was undertaken. The rail traffic was resumed at 19:00 and population allowed to return home at 22:00. At 02:34 firemen penetrated inside the store and at 05:00 the fire was considered as extinguished. The ORSEC emergency plan terminated at 07:00.","CAUSES:
When the Original Report was prepared the causes of the accident have not fully identified but it is supposed that it occurred as a combination of the following elements:
a) storage of a fertilizer compound which decomposed (this phenomenon is called self-substaining decomposition) due to a too high temperature and an excessive concentration of organic material (wheat saw dust) due to previous transportation;
b) no monitoring by means of thermometric probes of the development of high temperature in the heap during storage was foreseen;
c) the presence in the fertilizers heap of defective (due to poor insulation) power cables. These defective cables (due to their age and the oversizing of the fuses and circuit breakers) caused the fertilizers decomposition; the short duration in which electrical current flew should be pointed out (switch-on at about 09:00 and detection of smoke and switch-off at about 09:15). On the other hand, the short-circuit assumption must be discarded because people worked until they were switched off and, besides, no blown fuse was found and the heat generated by a short-circuit is generally insufficient to initiate decomposition;
d) wooden pallets in contact with the fertilizers compounds which caught fire during decomposition and released heat which accelerated the decomposition;
e) the absence of any efficient fire-fighting means. If there had been a massive quantity of water rapidly available to put out the fire, the decomposition could have been slowed down before to develop out of control.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Internal to the establishment, 29 people were injured by the accident (25 by the toxic release and 4 by the fire).MATERIAL LOSS:The storage installation was damaged by the fire but no data are available about the cost of the material damages.ECOLOGICAL HARM:During the main fire fighting attempt, products on fire were drenched under a water flow rate of 700m3/h. The contaminated fire fighting water caused a slight pollution of the La Loire river.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:When the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident, preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started, but, about 5 hours after the smoke began to appear, it was necessary to evacuate only 25,000 people. The rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. The ORSEC plan was activated and the decision to evacuate was made. Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers. Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people. Public was informed by vehicles with loudspeakers, telephone calls to town halls and through TV and local radio stations.Discussion of consequences: At 15:30, the maximum concentrations measured inside the installation were: nitric acid = 50ppm; nitrogen oxides = 5 ppm; chlorine = 3ppm. At 22:00 there were: nitric acid = 15ppm; nitrogen oxides = 5 ppm; chlorine = less 0.3ppm. At 02:45 there were: nitric acid = 0ppm; nitrogen oxides = 1 ppm; chlorine = 0.2ppm. Outside the installation, at 15:30 there were: nitric acid = 5ppm; nitrogen oxides = 0.2 ppm. At 22:00 there were 5ppm of nitric acid.

The fire was almost extinguished at 14:15 but emission of smoke was reduced considerably at 16:00. The rail traffic was resumed at 19:00 and population allowed to return home at 22:00 (code 7404). At 02:34 firemen penetrated inside the store and at 05:00 the fire was considered as extinguished.Discussion about response: At 08:00 four people started to work in the storage installation and, at 08:30, everything was normal. Some smoke was noticed by the storage personnel at about 09:15 am. The first reaction of the personnel was to use, unsuccessfully, portable fire extinguishers until the fire brigade intervened even if visible fire was never noticed. At 09:43 a 3 vehicle team arrived on-site and, after assessment of the situation, immediately requested a reinforcement with foam equipments. Fire fighting operations proceeded with difficulty owing to the yellow/red smoke cloud which had developed. The first attempt of the firemen was to isolate the ammonium nitrate in compartment No 5 from the compartment involved in the fire by means of water curtains. At 10:30 the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident and at 11:15 preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started (shelter information to the public by vehicles with loudspeakers, telephone calls to town halls and through TV and local radio stations). At the same time, the number of fire fighting equipments was increased involving all the nearby safety centres and continuous monitoring of cloud movements by means of a helicopter and metereological indications given by the Nantes station were carried out (the concentrations of main pollutants [nitric acid, nitrogen oxides and ammonia] inside and outside the storehouse and at nearby communities as a function of time are available in the Original Report and the in relevant presentation in the Seminar on ""The Notification of Major Accidents"" held at Rethymnon Greece on October 6/7 in 1988). The toxic cloud reached an height of about 250m and was 5km large and it was covering a surface of about 15 km. At 11:30 the rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. At 13:00 nitric acid concentrations of 5ppm were measured by the Nantes cell up to Coueron. The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. At 13:50 a request to the army for assistance with vehicles was made. At 14:00 the Mobile Chemical Action Cell of Angers was asked for help and for a reserve of isolating respirators. At 14:15 the ORSEC plan was activated and at 14:30 the decision to evacuate was made. Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers. Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people. During this period of time the products on fire were soaked with a total flow of 700m3/h. The fire was almost extinguished at 14:15 but emission of smoke was reduced considerably at 16:00 while reinforcement from other departments continued to arrive. At 17:20 the Prefect gave a Press Conference and at 18:00 a survey on the percentage evacuation achieved was undertaken. The rail traffic was resumed at 19:00 and population allowed to return home at 22:00. At 02:34 firemen penetrated inside the store and at 05:00 the fire was considered as extinguished. The ORSEC emergency plan terminated at 07:00.","Measures to prevent recurrence: After this accident, an extended research programme on ignition and fire in bulk fertilizers and in chemical stored in pallets was initiated. This study showed that burning velocities experimentally determined with small samples could be rather misleading. Tests with bigger amounts of material had recommended.Useful references: A more detailed map of the area is given in Fig. 1 of the relevant presentation in the Seminar on ""The Notification of Major Accidents"" held at Rethymnon - Greece in October 6/7 in 1988.

In fact the phases of partial or complete dismantling operations of an installation present hazards which have to be taken into account during the planning phase of these operations.","Benzoyl chloride (C6H5-COCl) is&nbsp; an acyl chloride. Its hydrolysis is strongly exothermic and forms benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH) and hydrogen chloride (HCL). A reaction occurs also with alcohols and forms an ester and release of HCl.This is what probably occurred when methanol (CH3OH) was added to&nbsp; the tank with a significant release of HCl ( estimated at 90 kg i.e. 55 m3 of hydrogen chloride per 100 l of methanol pumped into the tank and assuming a complete reaction). The reaction caused the heating of the mixture.A fault tree can be represented schematically as follows:Solid residues of benzoic acidProduct stored more than 3 years ----------&gt; emptying impossible ----------&gt; laboratory tests (but the pump was not suitable for pumping solids)Ignorance of the hazards (faulty hazard evaluation))----------&gt; addition of methanol but sampling not representative&nbsp; and distorted results ----------&gt;reaction of the products present in the tank and pressure rise ----------&gt; gas cloud over the dome and faulty joint----------&gt;the gas cloud drifted off-site due to the strong blustering wind, part of the cloud was abated ----------&gt;&nbsp; Inhabitants were affected","According to the declarations of witnesses, an opaque cloud with fuzzy contours was seen&nbsp; above the installation and drifted towards the houses located some 150 m from the tank involved in the accident. The inhabitants suffered from eye burning. An older person affected was transported to hospital and maintained under observation for a day. The phenomenon lasted during a few minutes. The acid gas cloud released from the tank drifted following the wind direction but its dispersion was partly hindered by the buildings adjoining the storage area. There was no ecological damage to the river crossing the site.","When the accident occurred several alarms were triggered in the guard room, the guard alerted the onsite fire fighting station .The personnel attempted to abate the cloud by setting up a water curtain and by spraying the tank.The public emergency response services&nbsp; were&nbsp; alerted by neighbours of the installation who had observed an abnormal gas cloud and were suffering from burning eyes. The emergency response services arrived on the site approximately 10 minutes after having been called. The Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) was notified by the emergency response service of the fire brigade one hour after the accident. The management of the installation was not present on-site when the accident occurred. The management reached the installation at 13:15 h following an explicit request of the Classified Installation Inspectorate (DRIRE). The Onsite Contingency Plan (POI - Plan d'Opération Interne) was only activated by the operator&nbsp; 2 hours later.The emergency response services responded by sending the chemical emergency unit and several vehicles (pump-trucks and ambulances equipped to carry victims injured or asphyxiated ). The spray water collected in the retention ponds was evacuated to&nbsp; a specialised company for disposal.Sampling of hydrogen chloride was performed (with Dräger detector tube) by the emergency response services&nbsp; near the storage area and downwind at the outskirts of the premises. No abnormal situation was found 2 hours after the occurrence.The public emergency response operation was partially called off in the late afternoon.Immediate consequencesAfter sealing the leak in correspondence with the joint, no other leakage was visible on the tank the evening after the accident. The chemical reaction process had stopped and the system had returned to a stable condition. On request of the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) a continuous monitoring of the installations was set up and the mandatory presence of a management representative was&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; for the night and&nbsp; renewed during the following days. A tarpaulin was installed above the tank to protect the tank against atmospheric agents.The Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) requested the operator to prepare a technical report ( the request was also supported by&nbsp; an urgent prefectoral order) describing the securing works to be performed, the preventive measures to be taken concerning the safety of the operations as well as the necessary emergency&nbsp; response means. Before performing any other operation, the setting up of a new emptying procedure for the tank was requested, the procedure being subject to validation by a third party expert.Two distinct stages were defined: - on one hand preparatory works for securing the storage installation- on the other hand the emptying procedure itself with the cleaning of the tank, these procedures&nbsp; were subject to validation by a third party expert before approval by the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE).The operations foreseen comprised five phases:- Phase 1 - securing operation- Phase 2 - repair of the leakage point- Phase 3 - fluidisation and homogenisation- Phase 4 - emptying of the tank- Phase 5 - decontaminationThe first two phases were carried out on 19th March 2002. The following phases, were performed at the end of April 2002 in accordance with an expert report by INERIS&nbsp; and the transfer of the product to a centre for the disposal of hazardous waste was performed on 30th April 2002.","Following the event, the Prefect of Val d'Oise issued an urgent prefectoral order dated 13th February 2002, applying article L 512-7 of the Environmental Regulations obliging the operator to take measures&nbsp; for cleaning and securing the installations, for dismantling the installations, for avoiding the recurrence of a similar event considering that a storage installation for hazardous substances is present on the site. This prefectoral order obliged the company to issue and submit for approval the procedures prior to the emptying operations of the benzoyl chloride tank and of another tank containing aluminium chloride (CAS 7446-70-0); the procedures were subject to validation by a third party expert.The Classified Installations Inspectorate also requested the operator to submit&nbsp; an accident report. The analysis of the accident report and the on-site investigation have shown the following failures:- failure to notify the accident to the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE)- absence of a management representative on the site and failure in managing the organisation and decision chain with respect to the safety issues- late release of the onsite contingency plan- organisational failure of the operator in managing the immediate consequences of the accident- corrosion of the external tank wall- overflow alarm of the tank not connected to the control room- bad condition of the joint on the man-hole flange of the tank- carrying out of the emptying procedure presenting hazards to the personnel and the environment consequent to a faulty hazard assessment which led to the use of incompatible substances and a wrong evaluation of the consequences of such an operation.- missing hazard labelling on the methanol container- bad condition of the fire fighting hoses on the site- The validity of a certain number of Dräger detector tubes for HCl had expired in 1998"

This resulted in the automatic shut-down of the chlorine production plant (except the chlorine destruction unit) and the manual shut-down after operators intervention of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) production plant because of lack of adequate cooling capacity. The fire was prevented from spreading during the first hour of the accident. After verification of the correct functioning of main switches at the municipal electricity supply (automatic disconnection), the fire was extinguished in about half an hour (by both factory and local fire brigades). The chlorine production (membrane electrolysis) was interrupted for 10 days (followed by gradual increase in production) while the production of HCB was resumed with chlorine imported by rail.","CAUSES:
When the Original Report was prepared the causes of the accident have not fully identified but the gradual formation of carbon particles in the mineral oil was suspected to be the cause for the short-circuit in the switch-cupboard.",Material loss - Remarks: No data are available about the cost of the damage to the electrical power station and to the switch-cupboards caused by the fire.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Apart from the measures taken by the factory and the local fire brigades to fight the fire, the main action was the intervention in the manual shut-down of the hexachlorobenzene production plant due to the lack of cooling capacity. The chlorine production plant (except the chlorine destruction unit) was automatically shut-down.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Local fire brigade, chemical advisers and environmental authorities were alerted. As no toxic release occurred, no off-site emergency measures were necessary.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, it was decided on the installation of an inert gas-filled switch-cupboard instead of the oil-filled type.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, it was decided the installation of the new switch-cupboards in separate compartments using a fire-resistant partition."

(workers) through the visual and acoustic alarm systems which were
activated by an abnormal temperature increase. Seeing the flames the
operators activated manually the fixed CO2 (carbon-dioxide) fire
extinguishing system. At the same time they alerted the fire brigade of
the adjacent Enichem establishment which is a service in common with
the Montefibre establishment. Due to the size (gravity, extension) of
the fire, the National Fire Brigade was also alerted, the first fire
fighting teams arriving 20 minutes after the fire started. At the same
time the safety measures foreseen by the onsite emergency plan for the
drying department were taken (safety measures: shut down of the
electrical supply to the machines, insertion of the emergency lighting
system, and water-curtains upstream from the dryer and in the silos
area, activation of the extinguishing system in the adjacent dryer).
The fire was completely extinguished at 15:30 hours. It has generated a
cloud of smoke which expanded in wind direction, mainly towards the
residential area of Marghera, whose nearest houses are located at about
four kilometres (4 km) from the establishment.Type of accident - Remarks: Fire of an acrylic polymer during the drying phase in a belt dryer, downstream from a polymerisation plant, involving the whole drying plant and the release of a cloud composed of polymer combustion products, which moved towards neighbouring installations and establishments in the direction of the residential area of Marghera situated at a distance of about four kilometres (4 km) from the installation (establishment).Source of accident - Remarks: The accident originated (started) in the copolymer belt dryer, divided in several sections, in each of which small quantities of water (residual from preceding processing phases of the polymer) are eliminated gradually with a hot air stream.Meteorological conditions - Remarks: The wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric stability was measured at 40 metres (40 m) above ground

The access to the installation has been requested to the investigating attorney by the Competent Authorities. The attorney has authorised the access to allow proper investigation.Official action taken - other official action: The attorney general office of Venice is making an official investigation to identify the causes of the accident.&nbsp; Seveso II duties  - remarks: Considering that there have been no
people affected (nobody injured), and that emergency measures were
adequate to the occurrence, the response to the accident can be
considered effective (effective response, adequate measures taken).","Immediate lessons: The company has to review the drying process in order to avoid the recurrence of such an accident. No further investigations.Measures to prevent recurrence: From the analysis of the safety report presented to the competent authorities in compliance to the Italian legislation implementing the Seveso Directive it results that the accident which occurred was considered in the safety report as the most probable with respect to the specific equipment (plant). In relation to this a thorough analysis of possible fire causes had been realised, considering also historical data on fires in similar installations. To avoid the occurence of fires, adequate structural and operational measures had also been foreseen. Nevertheless the accident (fire) occurred, therefore it has to be assumed that it occurred because of the measures foreseen have been implemented not at all or only partially (inadequate implementation, causes identified but no adequate response). It appears that the company had planned to adopt further measures in addition to those indicated in the safety report in order to reduce the fire risk, measures which could not be implemented in time, due to the fire.Useful references: The models employed are those commonly employed for atmospheric releases forming clouds containing combustion products of solid substances (standard models)."

When the failure began the mixing tank contained about 150 kg of solution of ca. 50% of hypophosphorous acid. The 50% acid was produced by concentration of 3000 liters of 2.5% acid at temperature conditions of about 50 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius in vacuum (ca. 40 mb). From analysis in the laboratory the concentration 45 minutes before the event was about 37%. Shortly before the event the above mentioned parameters were controlled and found unchanged. Probably at the liquid level in the mixing tank a crystalline incrustation formed. This then dryed because of over- heating and decomposed spontaneously. Apart from phosphoric acid an amount of phosphine was formed as decomposition product sufficient to destroy the vacuum and to drive back the unfastened manhole cover. Phosphine was released to the work area and ignited when mixing with air. At the same time part of the substance flowed via the vacuum pump into the piping system that wasstill intact at the moment of the first explosion.

A release of fuel oil and heating fuel occurred on the pipe-line connecting the coastal oil storage facility and the thermal power plant during supply operations of the power plant.

The accident is classified at level 3 of the accident gravity scale due to the amount of released product (650 m3). This accident is worth being notified due to the  typology of the event (not exceptional) and the particular environmental conditions( effects of marine shore conditions on materials).
The goal of the product transfer which started the accident on 18th September, was to replenish the on-site stock of the power plant.On 18th September 2001, the presence of heavy fuel oil on the ground was observed in a corn-field at approximately 600 m from the hydrocarbon storage installation.","The pollution was caused by a leakage which occurred during the days preceding the detection of the release, a provisory repair was performed, the transfer operations of heavy fuel oil were performed from then on under increased control.The programme set up to investigate the occurrence was organised as follows:- visual investigation;- chemical analysis;- micrographic&nbsp; (microscopic); - testing with an electronic micro-analyser probe.The chemical analysis confirmed that the steel analysed corresponded to the specifications defined for constructing the pipe-line.The micrographic test performed near the piercing showed a significant thickness reduction of the pipe wall and several corrosion points. It was found that at the level of the piercing point the material was torn. Several corrosion craters were also found outside the area around the piercing point.On the other hand the presence of oxides on the external wall of the pipe and on the ripped borders makes it plausible that the leakage was not recent.The tests with an electronic micro-analyser probe on the oxides found externally to the pipe-line wall showed the presence of chlorides.These investigations led the operator to the following conclusions:- the piercing of the pipe-wall was due to a significant loss of thickness of the pipe-walls;- the generalised external corrosion of corresponding pipe-section was caused by chlorides; - brackish water was present because of changes in the watershed-level and contamination of the water shed with sea water; - and finally a localised failure of the pipe-protection were the originating causes of the occurrence.The assumption of the contamination of the watershed with sea-water was confirmed by the institution of hydro-geological experts of the Department of southern Corsica. Changes of the water-shed level were significant, rising several metres over a few days up to&nbsp; above ground level. ","The investigations performed by the operator have shown-&nbsp; soil pollution of the superficial earth layers with heavy fuel oil -&nbsp; soil pollution with light fuel oil&nbsp; limited to the sandy areas of the underground, this kind of pollution was contained within the sandy layers by the presence of a considerable amount of compact turf-&nbsp; pollution of the underground watershed localised to a limited area but potentially migrating at an unknown speed.The amount of light fuel oil which infiltrated underground was estimated by the operator at 400 m3 to which the already recovered amount&nbsp; (250 m3) has to be added. The validity of this estimate is questionable due to the fact that it is unknown when exactly the spillage started.","The Monitoring and Response Plan was released and the following measures were taken.- filling of the pipe-line with water without pressure- pumping of the liquid fraction of the product from the ground surface- search of the leakage point- stripping of the polluted soil surface (approximately 250 m3) and temporary storage in an hydrocarbon-proof area.The operator of the thermal power-plant performed apart from the above mentioned first measures 8 test drills and installed three piezometers in order to outline the polluted area. The method employed is failure points identification by current leakage detection. The control of the 7430 meters long pipe-line was performed. The method employed is failure points identification by current leakage detection. 17 failure points were found in the pipeline section named as ""upstream"" section&nbsp; corresponding to the section between the coast and the intermediary storage facility, and 9 failure points were found in the pipeline section called ""downstream"" corresponding to the section between the intermediate storage facility and the power plant .It was decided to investigate (digging, thickness measurements, metallurgical tests etc.) the failure points of the pipe-line according to a prioritization scale based on the level of importance of the failures identified.The Departmental Directorate of Agriculture and Forests (DDAA) in charge of the environmental police performed the monitoring of the soil- and groundwater- pollution.Moreover the operator has appointed a consultancy firm to:- clean up the polluted ground without stopping the pipe-line activity- decontaminate and dispose of the stored materials - clean up of the polluted underground watershed","Concerning repair operations the operator has included in the parts management system all available elements to reduce the impact of new leakages.From the material aspect,:- the method adopted to identify failures (current leakage detection) has proven to be effective and it is planned to extend the use of this method also to the other pipe-lines in the area affected by the rise of brackish water; in accordance with the results, it is planned to integrate this kind of control as well as the frequency in the context of an amendment to the Monitoring and Response Plans which will&nbsp; also provide for the regular control of the pipeline systems.Depending on the results of the tests the hypothesis of replacing entire pipe-lines or certain sections will be discussed. The mutual exchange of information between the Municipality and the operators was organised in the presence of the competent authorities DDAF; DDASS; DRIRE.In the context of a better information on hazardous underground structures an inter-organisational geographical information system (GIS) is under development; it will inform civil engineering companies about the pathways of underground pipe-lines and underground electric lines.&nbsp; "
191,512,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion in a pyrotechnical workshop manufacturing fireworks,2004-06-01 11:25:00,2004-06-01 00:00:00,"An explosion occurred in a pyrotechnical workshop manufacturing fireworks. The establishment is classified according to the Seveso Directive as upper tier.The accident is notified because of the number of victims: 2 people died in the accident. Several other employees were hospitalized for hearing disorders.For information, the accident is classified at level 3 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Comity of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive, according to this criterion.","The triggering event that released the detonation of the bombs located in the storage area is not known. The only two people working on filling the bombs in this building were the victims, their bodies being found some fifteen metres away.As of today, different investigations are in progress regarding this accident:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a judicial investigation (a criminal investigation assisted by a laboratory of the scientific police);-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an administrative investigation.The effect of the explosion of building 9 was surprising. There was a detonation, although the behaviour expected of the products present in the storage facility where the detonation occurred was:- rapid, highly intense flame without any significant blast, in accordance with the classification 1.3 of these products as defined in the pyrotechnic regulations in force.The zones of effects determined by the operator in the safety assessment initially performed were not more than 20 m for the lethal effect zone and 38 m for the irreversible effect zone.Considering the consequences of the accident, an expert advice bureau concluded that the detonation was equivalent to 15 to 30 kg of TNT. The shockwave recalculated on the basis of these assumption indicates a maximum extent of the radios for the lethal effect zone and the&nbsp; irreversible effect&nbsp; zone respectively in the order of 40 m and 70 m.In view of observations made on the ground it is possible that one of the 2 persons, or possibly both, were inside the candle loading room at the time (9B2).It is also possible that this operation was&nbsp; being conducted at the same time as the manufacture of the bombs (forbidden procedure).Hypotheses concerning the circumstances:The formation of a crater inside the storage area indicates that a considerable quantity of products detonated. Investigations finally took 3 potential causes into consideration:&nbsp;- the risk presented by the products usually stored in this area may have been wrongly assessed (the risk of detonation had not been taken into account). It is customary in this branch of activity to classify stars and small-diameter bombs as non-detonating products. As these products are not sold as they stand, the operator did not charge an approved certification body to perform the necessary testing procedures for classification. Storing the products in bulk and in a confined space may support the hypothesis of detonating product behaviour. Nevertheless the ignition remains unknown.&nbsp;- The products stored were exposed to a violent shock and the energy absorbed released the detonation. On this hypothesis, the shock may have been generated by a first accident on one of the two adjacent workstations (9B1 and 9B2),&nbsp; transmitted to the storage area (9A). However, detailed examination of the concrete floor of these two rooms (9B1 and 9B2) revealed no traces of explosion (no impact, no fragmentation of the concrete or traces of burning). As regards the possible transmission of the explosion from one area to the other, it should be noted with respect to the projectiles recovered and the accounts of witnesses, that at the time of the accident, the door of the storage area may have been left open (though this is prohibited by the safety regulations) and there may have been a handling trolley in vicinity of this door. This trolley might have been pushed towards the storage area by the projectiles generated by a first explosion. Pieces of this trolley were found 150 m from the building in the direction of access door to room 9A.- There may have been an unauthorized detonating product inside the room which caused the bombs to detonate when it caught fire. The product input/output register of building 9 was examined. The register did not show that storage capacity had been exceeded or the presence of any products other than the 50 and 60 mm bombs. Analysis of the debris from the bottom of the crater may allow to identify the composition of the pyrotechnic compound that detonated.Hypotheses concerning the triggering event:The initial ignition source and its location still remain unknown. A first explosion one of the workstations would have left marks on the concrete. An ignition source could have&nbsp; directly generated in the storage area in case of improper handling. However, this second possibility cannot be confirmed by the positions of the bodies of the victims.","Two persons were killed and six others suffering from slight injuries (hearing disorders) were hospitalized for examination. The material damage testifies to the violence of the explosion. In all, of the 27 fireworks buildings, 14 are wholly or partially destroyed, 9 are damaged. The entire manufacturing section is destroyed or seriously damaged: of the building involved, nothing remains, a crater of 2.5 m x 1 m by 0.5 m deep is visible in the concrete base; a trolley weighing 50 kg was thrown a distance of 200 m, and pieces of wall 50 m. 5 more damaged buildings will have to be pulled down. The vaults containing explosive substances were only slightly damaged.No domino effect was observed. No impact was observed outside, with the exception of the nearest house (broken windows), the site being isolated, away from residential zones. Two workers are likely to be temporarily laid off for technical reasons.","At the suggestion of the inspectors, the Prefect has issued an urgent order requiring, in particular, the shut down of production, the removal of finished products and the restriction of storage to buildings in an undamaged state.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shut down of fireworks production, with start up subject to a new authorization procedure;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; removal of the remaining pyrotechnical products from all the manufacturing workshops;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the rehabilitation of two storage buildings, in order to store the company's pyrotechnical products according to the existing regulations, within the authorized threshold limits;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the storage of all on site intermediate products in a third storage building;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the separation of storage facilities&nbsp; between products for sale and intermediate products;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the removal of pyrotechnical products from the other storage buildings;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the maintenance of permanent monitoring and control of the site;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the disposal of all those intermediate products whose expected behaviour in case of activation has been called into question.Since the accident, the operator has cleared his stocks of finished products on the occasion of the 2004 summer firework display season. The operation of elimination of non-saleable intermediate products was carried out by their disposal in accordance to the specific regulations in an dedicated area onsite.","A this stage of the investigation, lessons learned from the accident are primarily of organisational nature:The best possible risk characterisation of the products (according to the kind of storage or transport), with particular attention given to intermediate products. Since the operators of small installations have difficulty in classifying all their products by means of standardized tests, at the very least, a stricter implementation of existing regulations has to be sought;Compliance with the onsite safety procedures in force in the different areas. Vigilance on this point tends to wane with time and at busy periods;Maintenance of rigorous control of the operation conditions and the amounts of hazardous products presents in the manufacturing and storage units.These basic rules already figure in the French regulations applicable to this activity sector.On the technical level, even if the exact origin of the disaster remains unknown, several aggravating factors have been identified:The bulk storage in crates of the candle bombs, creating thus confinement conditions for these products, undoubtedly contributed in crating detonation conditions;The fact that the stored bombs were primed could have led to their mass ignition by friction. This is because the priming process consists in coating the outer surface of the bombs with a layer of gunpowder for the purpose of ensuring the propagation of the flame from one bomb to the next inside the candles;The proximity of the storage area of these products to the two manufacturing shops tends to introduce a risk of domino effect which may be wrongly evaluated. A surprise inspection operation was launched on 12 establishments in the Aquitaine region 3 weeks after the accident. Administrative and penal sanctions were imposed on 5 establishments, and complementary actions have also been taken towards contractors."
192,645,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Sulphuric acid dispersion from a vessel under pressurised blown for empty,1993-04-02 14:00:00,1993-04-02 00:00:00,"The transfer pipe from a mobile vessel to a oil storage vessel (for sulphuric acid) was blown with pressurised air to be emptied in order to prepare a repair work (leakage from a valve). But unknown to the service personnel the blowpipe of the oleum stockage vessel was blocked by crystalline SO3, so inside the vessel pressure was generated. Thereby the liquid oleum (SO3) was first squeezed, through the bottom blow valve, in a climb piping and from there directly to an absorption vessel with ammonium sulphate. Through the contact of oleum with the absorption metal a large amount of sulphur trioxide (SO3) was released. Due to the strong heat development a contemporary rupture of one gas pipe occurred such that Oleum invaded directly the plant and from there to the outside (about 500 kg SO3).",Choking of the discharge line of an Oleum storage vessel.,"- 24 people were hospitalised. 
- Glass rupture in the oil-absorber, corrosion due to oil escape on equipment, pipes and internal system canal.","The outlet was finally stopped by remote control of the bottom blow valve in the stock bin. Immediately after the alarm the firemen intervened in order to condense the stratus cloud with water screens. It was not possible to avoid, that the cloud would cross over the nearby river and could move in the direction of a nearby forest.","In the future the upper side of the stock bin will be completely heated and isolated, so that the venting line could never more obstruct. In the same time the pressure in the vessel will be measured and registered. Over a pressure of 0.3 bar an alarm results on the instrumentation. After any extraction the bottom valve will be automatically closed. The control succeeds through the connection of the oil supply. For each filling process the bottom valve will be closed by hand. The messenger routes within the installation will be checked and improved. In the future thorough organisational measures will be insured that aggrieved operations within the installation will be tempestively warned."
193,1240,Major Accident,Production of pharmaceuticals,Leak from an ammonia sphere,2017-10-19 09:25:00,2017-10-19 12:25:00,"At around 9:30, an ammonia leak occurred via a purge valve on a supply pipe to an NH3 storage sphere at a chemical plant.","The purge valve through which the leak occurred is between two sectional valves on the pipe supplying the NH3 sphere. In preparation for the planned checks, the sphere had been emptied and isolated from its NH3 supply. In order to do this, the two sectional valves were locked shut and the purge valve was locked open. The leak occurred during a transfer of NH3 from the unloading station directly to production. It was caused by a failure of the seal on the first sectional valve.",A cloud of ammonia formed. At 9:34 the sensors close to the leak detected that the 300 ppm threshold had been exceeded. The staff of the site (250 people) and 312 people at two neighbouring premises were put into lockdown. Two subcontractors were taken to hospital with minor injuries. The quantity of NH3 discharged during the 8 minutes of the leak is estimated at between 300 kg and 500 kg. Production was stopped for the day and restarted at around 21:00.,"An employee raised the alarm. A cloud of ammonia formed. Sensors detected a concentration greater than 100 ppm and triggered an alarm. An employee activated the emergency stop, cutting off the supply to the sphere and activating its deluge system. At 9:34 the sensors close to the leak detected that the 300 ppm threshold had been exceeded. The isolation valves of the NH3 distribution network closed. The internal emergency plan was launched by the operator at 9:35. The emergency services established a safety perimeter. The staff of the site (250 people) and 312 people at two neighbouring premises were put into lockdown. The fire brigade hosed the area of the leak to knock down the vapours. The water was directed into a bund. The supply pipe was purged and the discharge stopped. The internal emergency plan was lifted at 12:17, when the ammonia concentration at the site of the leak was measured at 20 ppm. The lockdown measures were lifted.",Check the seal on valves after each shutdown period.
194,1062,Major Accident,"Water and sewage (collection, supply, treatment)",Biogas leak at an urban wastewater treatment plant,2013-10-03 16:30:00,2013-10-06 15:00:00,"At about 16.30, a biogas detection alarm intermittently sounded in the control room of a large urban wastewater treatment plant, and the operator in charge transmitted the alert to the security station. Thinking that the alarm could be due to a problem with the sensor, a security guard equipped with breathing apparatus went to a manhole leading to the underground pipes that feed into the digesters for producing biogas, and confirmed that there was a pocket of biogas beside the sensor and also in two nearby manholes (100% of the lower explosive limit (LEL)). The site duty officer was alerted at 17.30 and, suspecting a leak in an underground pipe, he decided to shut off the sludge mixing booster and to mechanically ventilate the contaminated manhole shafts. The measure was lifted at 18.30 without the leaking pipe having been located, due to the tight network of underground pipes in the area.
The investigation was resumed 72 hours later, and measures were taken to reduce the flow of the leak and secure the area during the investigation. This was successful after 60 hours, when a 4 cm hole was discovered at a depth of 4 m in cast-iron piping (DN 400, PS=18 mbar) connecting two of the plant's digesters to the gasholders. 24 000 m³ of biogas was lost as a result of the leak. Since they could not be shut down, the output of these digesters was reduced by shutting off the mixing, heating and intake of sludge; the biogas zone was sealed off and ventilation was set up near the leak. A sleeve was placed over the leaky section, which was secured until the complete shutdown of the digesters it fed into, and its output (18 500 m³ of biogas) was progressively released into the atmosphere through the release valves. A segment of the pipe collapsed during the work, rendering repair impossible. The section of pipe was then isolated using a reversible joint of the 'panhandle' type. The biogas network and the station's other digesters were then put back into operation. The two digesters in question were cocooned (with mixing once per week) pending the replacement of the broken section of pipe, causing a production loss of 5% or EUR 160 000.","A hole measuring 4 cm was found at a depth of 4 m in the cast-iron piping (DN 400, PS=18 mbar) connecting two of the plant's digesters to the gasholders. The gradual internal corrosion of the cast-iron piping was the origin of the incident. The biogas released from the digester was very humid near the leak, because the first bleeding takes place after the location of the leak. In addition, the biogas produced in this plant has a higher H2S concentration than that from other sludge digestion plants, because the sludge contains less ferric chloride (which neutralises H2S). Finally, these biogas pipes are among the oldest on the site, and as a result have suffered longer exposure to the corrosive agents in biogas.",Production loss of roughly EUR 160 000.,"The site duty officer was alerted at 17.30 and, suspecting a leak in an underground pipe, he decided to shut off the sludge mixing booster and to mechanically ventilate the contaminated manhole shafts.

investigation of the source of the oil pollution was started. On the basis of oil traces a leak of diesel was found in the Hajek storage site. The disused pipeline that should have been removed was welded together with a steel plate plug. During
the unloading of the railway tanker the diesel was squeezed through the closed

202,1140,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of tail gas from a tail gas pipe at a carbon black plant,2018-08-10 10:55:00,2018-08-10 16:40:00,"At around 11:00 on 10 August 2018 a leak was detected in an insulated tail gas pipe.Reactors were shut down in order to reduce the pressure and rate of flow in the pipe, and the escaping gas was condensed by the fire brigade using a water curtain.The insulation was also removed in order to assess the damage.
Safety measures:The loss of pressure and flow reduction were detected by the staff from the values in the process management system, and response measures were then taken (partial shutdown of the reactors to reduce pressure and flow as much as possible and stripping of the pipe).","The ongoing expert investigation so far indicates the following scenario:The section of pipe concerned was often not in use, which led it to cool and corrosive components in the tail gas to condense. The resulting corrosive liquid gradually eroded the wall of the pipe until a hole formed.","Damage to the pipe affected.Costs: EUR&nbsp;100,000","The plant fire service carried out measurements of hazardous substances and cordoned off the area around the site of the damage. The escaped gas was condensed using a water curtain.

203,1045,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion in a petrochemical plant,2011-10-21 15:25:00,2011-10-21 16:05:00,"At a Seveso-classified petrochemical plant, a pipe supplying air to a steam production boiler exploded at 3:40 pm, triggering a few seconds later a 2nd and more powerful explosion on a duct used to recover volatile organic compounds (VOC). The explosion and debris from the duct caused a fire outbreak on both a duct cyclofilter and a 1,000-litre vinyl acetate tank at the base of a distillation column, as well as a leak on the pipe feeding a 1-m³ oxygen tank.","The polyethylene (PE) polymerisation unit had been modified 2 years prior to the accident; moreover, a system for treating the VOC stemming from degassing of this unit (cooling and condensation of the heaviest compounds) had been installed. The compounds remaining in a gaseous state (ethylene, vinyl acetate) were then piped to a fan, with a flow rate of 25 to 50 kg/hr. At the fan outlet, these compounds entered a VOC recovery duct (L: 300 m, d: 1.5 m). Initially, this duct solely transported a mix composed of air and a small proportion of degassed VOC from the PE bead storage silos (< 10% of the lower flammable limit). The site's 2 boilers, which were supplying steam to both the site's steam cracker and flare in order to remove black smoke, burned the gaseous mix being fed through the duct. This process enabled eliminating a large portion of the VOC generated by the polyethylene production process.
The investigation conducted by the operator revealed that a liquid hydrocarbon mix (solvent and vinyl acetate) had formed inside the polymerisation VOC recovery pipe before being propelled by the fan into the boiler supply duct, where this mix accumulated. An inflammable atmosphere had thus been created in the pipe section adjacent to the boilers. On the day of the accident, this atmosphere caused an explosion in the air inlet to one of the boilers; this blast spread to the duct section near the fan. Such a scenario of driving liquid VOC at the degassing outlet of extruding machines had not been anticipated in the safety reports prior to modifying the polymerisation unit.","Rescue services, notified ahead of time, transported to hospital 5 employees, 2 of whom with hearing problems and the other 3 suffering from shock due to the blast; 1 subcontractor was examined at the site's infirmary. The VOC duct was destroyed over some 100 m. The boilers were damaged; the cracking furnaces had to be inspected, with their heating tubes needing to be changed due to the sudden shutdown without steam. The damage and extended downtime generated economic losses on the order of several million €, not counting the redundancies caused by plant renovations.","The internal emergency plan was activated at 3:47 pm; the plant's siren sounded and the 250 employees were evacuated, as were personnel from neighbouring firms.Onsite first responders extinguished the fire sources using 2 foam nozzles and 4 vehicles; they left the oxygen tank empty, but set up nozzles and a water curtain to dilute the leak. The situation was brought under control by 4:15 pm, and the emergency plan was lifted at 6:42 that evening.","The operator proceeded by building a VOC treatment system dedicated to the polymerisation unit, which was designed to be independent of the storage silo VOC treatment facility."

The flare peaked at 100 m, and the winds blew black smoke towards the sea. The operator issued a press release. The plant restarted after 24 hours.
The activation was due to a transient fault on the communication line connecting the motor's two safety controllers: that which controls the variable speed drive and that which monitors the compression line.

211,57,Major Accident,Chemical installations - carbon oxides,Pungent odours released by a chemical plant,2014-09-06 01:00:00,2014-09-06 07:00:00,"
At around 12.00 noon, the emergency services were on the ground in Saint-Louis in response to complaints received from several dozen residents about pungent odours. A patrol carrying out visual and olfactory checks traced the source of the odour to inside a chemical plant. The operator was contacted and reported that, between 11:00 and 11:30 a.m., a tank containing a preparation of ethyl acrylate based lubricant (inflammable, highly reactive and highly odorous: odour threshold of 0.001 ppm) had accidentally risen in temperature (118&nbsp;°C instead of 58&nbsp;°C) and pressure (1 bar instead of vacuum conditions). The tank was rinsed out and degassed. The gases emitted were diverted towards the unit’s scrubber where they were filtered, condensed and scrubbed. The wash water was collected in a retention pit pending pumping and treatment by a wastewater treatment plant in Switzerland.
","The incoming shift took up their posts in the manufacturing workshop at 5.00 a.m. They were not informed (or were incorrectly informed) by the outgoing shift that the tank containing ethyl acrylate was full and awaiting continuation of the manufacturing process. Thinking that it was empty, the new shift did not think to check its status. In the control room, the shift foreman saw on the screens that the tank’s vacuum pump, allowing a reaction control pressure to be maintained, was in operation. He decided to shut it down because he thought that the previous shift had forgotten to do so. Due to the increase in pressure in the tank as a result of the pump being shut down, the manufacturing reaction restarted and went out of control. As it was not possible to regulate the flow of gases in the tank’s relief conduit (DN 500 and on-off valve), the gases from the reaction were released too quickly to allow the unit’s purification systems to neutralise them (insufficient size).",The ethyl acrylate released from the scrubbers&rsquo; chimneys could be smelled in the vicinity.,"The tank was rinsed out and degassed. The gases emitted were diverted towards the unit’s scrubber where they were filtered, condensed and scrubbed. The wash-water was collected in a retention pit pending pumping and treatment by a wastewater treatment plant in Switzerland.","The owner reiterated the requirement for the incoming shift to systematically check the production line tanks, regardless of the information given by the outgoing shift. Awareness was raised among staff of the need to follow instructions precisely and a technical change was made to the system for releasing gas from the tank to the unit’s condensers and scrubbers (fitting the relief conduit with a low-diameter bypass equipped with a valve)."
212,1098,Major Accident,"Fuel storage (including heating, retail sale, etc.)",Compressed ethylene leak at a petrochemical complex,2015-10-17 17:30:00,2015-10-17 17:50:00,"At a petrochemical complex, ethylene compressor 1 (ethylene is a highly flammable gas) was operating in a stable manner when, at 5.33 p.m., a sharp fall in pressure occurred together with a piercing noise. The gas detectors in the area became saturated and set off a second-level alarm in the unit’s control room, in the control room for the adjacent compressor 2 and at the safety desk. The compressor began vibrating. Its motor shut down although its ethylene supply did not.
Confusion as to which compressor was the origin of the leak:
not knowing which compressor the leak was coming from, the shift in charge of compressor 1 contacted the shift in charge of compressor 2. The latter convinced them that it was compressor 2 that was affected. Shift 1 therefore left its control room to come to their assistance. The alarms and readings showing that compressor 1 was malfunctioning (fall in pressure, etc.) were not taken into account as the control room was empty.","A valve was projected outwards due to incorrect tightening and a non-compliant seal.
The valve cover and light from the second floor of compressor 1 were discovered 6&nbsp;m away. One of the cover’s threaded pins had broken in two (sudden brittle-type fracture), while the remaining five threaded pins were still in place, with three having had their nuts blown off and threading stripped. These threaded pins were compliant but had not been replaced since the compressor was put into service 16 years previously. An expert investigation showed that the valve’s copper seal had not been annealed during assembly, contrary to procedure and unlike the other seals in the equipment. It was therefore not very flexible and had low capacity for absorbing strain. This fault, together with an error in tightening the threaded pin that was already approaching plastic deformation, caused the assembly to rattle and fracture.
The operator checked the other compressors, reviewed and replaced the threaded pins in the compressor for which the technology had changed (rolled threads instead of cut threads). It updated the maintenance plans for the compressors together with the sub-contractor. The threaded pins are to be replaced on every third servicing. The damaged compressor was put back into service after two months.","The two shifts together with the in-house firefighters approached the accident area but were unable to enter due to the deafening noise. They found an inflammable ethylene cloud 4&nbsp;m high and 100&nbsp;m long, with visible droplets. 1.8 tonnes of ethylene (inflammable mass of 354&nbsp;kg) was released in 21 minutes.","The firefighters used water curtains to protect adjacent units. At around 5.45 p.m., shift leader 1 consulted the shift leader of the adjacent unit. They suspected a leak in the ethylene supply network. Two operators with noise protection equipment went into the cloud, protected by a water curtain, so as to reach the network’s manual cut-off valves. They shut them manually, stopping the leak. The cloud quickly dispersed. The staff returned to the control room and shut the local valve feeding the compressor.","Information that would have made it possible to rapidly identify the equipment in which the leak originated was not taken advantage of because there was no-one in the control room and the information was not relayed to the mobile phones of the shift members who had gone to investigate or made their way to the other control rooms in the complex.
If the emergency shut-down had been activated, the leak would have been stopped earlier as such a shut-down cuts off both the motor and the ethylene supply. The staff thought it was enough that the motor had shut down as a safety measure when the vibration occurred. After the accident, the compressor was fitted with a system for emergency shut-down when gas is detected. However, manual emergency shut-down is still crucial in the event that the gas detection fails.
Despite the risks of the cloud igniting (UVCE, flash fire), the internal emergency plan was not launched, staff were not evacuated and movements on the site were not restricted.&nbsp; The emergency services and nearby municipalities were not alerted. At the time, the head of the safety team deemed the situation to be under control because it was not windy and there were no sub‑contractor firms on site that day, a Saturday (no works, low vehicle traffic). The authorities were notified more than 24 hours later. The external alert procedures were reviewed."

Samples were taken from the water intake stations for the nearby town of 5,000 people, both upstream and downstream of the water treatment system. These samples confirmed the presence of bromates.","The source of the discharge was the flushing out of effluent from the incineration unit for chlorinated residues (which also contained bromine).

Relative humidity = approximately 50%.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The police was alarmed by a person who smelt chlorine outside the plant (Trekronergade) at 17:43. The police responded together with the Fire Brigade. The area around the establishment was sealed off and a warning to the public was given through the National Broadcasting System. The Fire Brigade located the chlorine release, stopped the hot water spray system and finally stopped the leakage about 2 hours after the police was called, by refitting the bushing and the valve stem at 19:35. It has been estimated that the chlorine concentrations at the fence were in the order of 6-20 ppm. 4 staff members and 4 police officers were hospitalised 24 hours after the accident for observations but no permanent injuries have been reported.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The valve stem and the threaded bushing of the rod were apparently forcefully unscrewed overriding the locking provided by a locking screw. Following this, the bushing and the valve stem were ejected or pulled out, allowing chlorine vapour to flow out through the valve into the chlorine room and further to the surroundings.CAUSES:The cause of the accident was the unscrewing of the bushing and valve stem. It was not possible, after the accident, to establish who unscrewed the valve stem or whether this was done by mistake (due to insufficient personnel training and/or operating procedures). It may be underlined that the workers present when the release occurred were foreigners and, therefore, language problems may have been involved.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:8 people (4 staff members and 4 Police Officers) were hospitalized for one day after the accident for medical observations, but no permanent injuries have been reported.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The Police sealed off the area around the establishment and the buses were rerouted.

215,874,Other Event,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire at the petroleum at refining,2006-10-12 14:32:00,2006-10-12 20:57:00,"From 2 to 4 October 2006 repairs were carried out at omissis nafta of the KR‑601/2 furnace in section 001 of the KT-1/1 combined
technological device for deep processing of fuel oil; these works consisted of
replacing the three worn out sections of the heating spiral in the radiation
part of the furnace. After completing the works at 8:00 in the morning of 12
October 2006 the work was begun on starting up the KR-601/2 furnace. The
burners were ignited in the KR‑601/2 furnace, the temperature was raised and
the furnace heating spirals were filled with fuel oil, which began feeding into
the K-601 column at 9:28 of the same day. Prior to connecting KR‑601/2 to the
system, the raw material was fed into the K-601 column by heating it in the KR-601/1
reserve furnace. The technological parameters of the KR-601/1 furnace and K‑601
column were within the allowed limits. The KR-601/2 furnace was connected to the system by
gradually raising the temperature of the raw material supplied to the column.
According to the technical regulation of the vacuum fuel oil rectification and tar
visbreaking section 001 of the combined technological device KT-1/1 for deep
processing of fuel oil, the temperature of the supplied raw material needs to
be raised by 30 to 35°C per hour. It is apparent from the analysis of the diagrams
of technological parameters that from 12:55 to 14:24 the temperature of the raw
material being supplied was rising by 38 to 45°C per hour, meaning that the
limits specified in the technical regulation were being exceeded. Certain other divergences from the technological regime can
be seen from the diagrams of the parameters of the technological regime: - at 9:32 and at 9:48 the vacuum pressure in the column
decreased to 104.435 mm Hg st. and 67.018 mm Hg st. respectively (usually the vacuum
pressure in the column is about 20 mm Hg st.); - from 13:37 the level of tar started decreasing sharply at
the bottom of the K‑601 column, and at 14:24 the measuring devices could not
register it at all. According to the technical regulation, the level of tar at
the bottom of the column must remain within the limits of 40 to 90%; - from 14:00 to 14:23 the pressure of the cleavage gas in
separators SP-603/1 and SP-603/2 started increasing sharply (from 0.53 bar. to
-0.335 bar.); - from 10:55 to 12:25 the total amount of raw material being
fed into the K-601 column was about 544 m3/h. At 13:55 the amount of the raw
material being supplied decreased to 447 m3/h. The debit was increased,
and at 14:25 the amount of the raw material being fed into the column was 520
m3/h. At 14:30 the supply of the raw material into the column stopped
completely . - At 14:24 there was a complete absence of vacuum pressure
in the K-601 column; - At 14:30 the S-608 pump stopped pumping and was operating
an empty cycle. The Communication Point of the Operative Management Section
of the Fire Rescue Service of omissis received the fire alarm from
the K-601 column at 14:32 after the fire safety alarm was set in bases Nos 6
and 7 of section 001. The firefighters on duty in team 1 of the omissis Fire Safety Service were the first to begin extinguishing the fire in section
001, using fire rescue truck PA-40(131)137. The remaining firefighters in team 1
and team 2 were immediately sent to site of the fire. When the first of those
teams arrived at the site at 14:36 the column and an area covering 200 sq.m. at
the bottom of the column were alight. When the column collapsed at 14:54 the
fire spread across an area of 800 sq. m."," The commission found during the investigation that, according
to the drawing contained in the technical passport of the K-601 column, the 150
mm long junction pipe at the bottom of the column ends with a coupling junction,
however, the junction pipe is actually mounted by connecting it to the technological
pipeline No 619/1 with a welded connection. These technical modifications
are not shown in the drawings of the technical passport of the K-601 column. It
was found during the investigation that the design solution to replace the coupling
junction with a connection by welding was adopted and approved in 1987. On the
basis of the same solution, the steal containing 5% Cr and 0.5% Mo (steal type
according to GOST 5520-79), as foreseen in the initial project for the
production from the 426 x 10 pipe of the elements of the technological pipeline
No 619/1 connected to the junction pipe of the K‑601 column, was replaced
by carbonic construction steal 22K, according to GOST 5520-79. According to the
globally recognised methods against corrosion, if the technological product
sulphur content exceeds 0.5% and the product temperature exceeds 260 0C, corrosion
and heat-proof metal must be used (as was foreseen in the initial project). As
the technological product sulphur content of the K-601 column and the product
temperature highly exceeds the values referred above (2.6% and 625 0C
accordingly), it can be stated that the replacement of the type of steal was an
inadequate solution that resulted in the corrosion of the pipeline
No 619/1. This is confirmed by tests carried out during the investigation,
according to which, the metal of the wall of the separated pipe in the pipeline
No 619/1, between the parts of the vacuum column and the separation valve,
is affected by inter‑crystal corrosion and bottom layer erosion (corrosion).
The investigated parts of the technological pipeline No 619/1 were
affected by erosion (corrosion) at the time of operation and up to the moment
of fire. It is likely that the thinning of different walls of the pipe was
predicated by erosion (corrosion) before the fire. The thickness of the wall in
some places was only 0.15 mm. It was found during the investigation that, at the moment when
the fire was detected and during the extinguishing of the initial fire, it was the
bottom part of the K-601 column, located in the intermediary area of the
pedestal of the K-601 column and between feedwater heaters of the column and
section 001 of the KT 1/1 technological device that was on fire. According to the opinion of the investigating commission,
the most likely reason for the fire in the section 001 of the KT 1/1 combined
technological device for deep processing of fuel oil is the ignition of the
technological product (tar), previously heated to the self‑incineration
temperature, after this product burst out through the crack (or cracks) in the
part affected by corrosion of the technological pipeline No 619/1 between the
junction pipe of the K-601 column and the separating valve. Such cracks may
have resulted from the thinning of the wall in the part of the said pipeline to
the level that it was not able to resist the pressure load. It results from the analysis of the technical regulation of
the vacuum fuel oil rectification and tar visbreaking 001 section of the
combined technological device KT-1/1 for deep processing of fuel oil, that the
actions of the technological staff faced with changes in technological
parameters (tar level at the bottom of the K-601 column (the cube) or vacuum
level inside the column K-601) and their technological management are not
strictly regulated and the technological staff operating the device acts on the
basis of instructions from their directors or based on their own personal
experience. At the time of the accident the staff operating the device notices
any change in technological parameters (decrease of the tar level at the bottom
of the column and sudden decrease of vacuum in the column itself) attempted to
restore the parameters, by regulating the column load and the tar debit from
the bottom of the column, but at that time the product was already coming
through the possible place of dehermetisation in the part of the technological
pipeline No 619/1 between the K-601 column junction pipe and the
separating valve. It has almost been an hour (from 13:37 to 14:30) that no one
of the operating personnel passed through the K-601 column and inspected it or
the related equipment, in order to identify the reasons for the decreased tar
level in the cube of the K-601 column. On 15 October 2004 the management plans approved by the
chairperson of the board of omissis provided for the reduction of
operating costs, by extending the intervals between general repairs by at least
4 years and more, and, at the same time, for the improvement of the long-term
reliability of devices. According to the commission, this decision fails to
improve the long-term reliability of devices, as the repairs of separate
devices, without stopping the production for general repairs, cannot allow the
full taking into account of the wear and tear of the devices and their
condition. The last general repairs at omissis were carried out in
2003, and the repairs planned for 2006 were postponed. The manufacturer set a service period of 11 years for the
K-601 vacuum column (technical passport of the device, page 129, Table 2
“Technical characteristics”). The inner condition of the K-601 column was
inspected on 26 September 1997 together with hydraulic tests. Based on the
inspection and test results, also the investigations performed and conclusions
presented by the joint stock omissis, omissis decided
to extend the period of operation of the column (the fact recorded in the
technical passport of the K-601 column). The last inspection of the inner and outer condition of the
K-601 column was performed on 9 January 2006 (the fact recorded in the
technical passport of the K-601 column). According to the requirements of the
Instructions No BM-2 for using pressure vessels, the next date for the
inner and outer inspection of the column was set to 9 January 2010, i.e. the
planned frequency of the inspections was 4 years. Acting on the basis of the Instruction for the use of
pressure pipelines No BM-4, approved Order No 83 of the deputy
director for production technology and capital integration of omissis
of 23 April 2004, the pipeline maintenance engineer of the Diagnostic Facility
performs the technical inspections of the pressure pipeline No619/1 (from the K-601
column to the pumps S-608, S-613/1, S-613/2). The last inspection of the operating
pipeline No 619/1 (hereinafter referred to as IOP) and the full
verification of its technical condition (hereinafter referred to as VTC) was
performed on 15 December 2004. The inspection found some minor shortcomings,
however, it concluded that the repairs of the pipeline were not necessary, and
the next inspection dates were set accordingly at 15 December 2008 for IOP and
15 December 2010 for VTC (the fact recorded in the technical passport of the
K-601 column)."," The samples of ambient air in omissis, omissis and omissis
villages were taken and their residents were inquired. Based on the results of inspection of ambient air, the
concentration of chemicals found (nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide) did not
exceed the single limit values allowed by omissis Hygiene Standard HN
35:2002 “Limit Values of Polluting Substances in the Ambient Air of Residential
Areas”. None of the employees of omissis or residents of
the surrounding areas addressed to omissis hospital reception due to health
problems related to the fire at omissis. Neither the ambulance of omissisi had any calls related to this accident. Having regard to the information available, no objective
facts demonstrating the consequences to public health of the fire at omissis were found. Having received all the required documentation and
calculations from omissis, the officers of the State Environmental
Protection Inspectorate and omissis Regional Environmental Protection
Department inspected the place of the accident and the related communications
and performed the required measurements and laboratory tests. After collecting all the available data it was found that it
was only the ambient air that suffered damage, after the pollutants fled into
the atmosphere in the result of fire. It was found that 9.13 t of different oil
products burned during the fire at omissis and the resulting damage
to the environment amounted to omissis 68 864.66 (equivalent approx. to 19900 Euro). Omissis suffered material damage of omissis 530
748 (equivalent approx. to 153700 Euro), i.e. the assets of the corresponding value that no longer fit for purpose
were written off the accounting. ","30 fire rescue cars and 82 state fire rescue service
officers from omissis, omissis and omissis county Fire Safety Services
participated in the elimination of the accident and 17 pressure guns were
used to extinguish the fire.","In order to avoid similar accidents in future, the following
recommendations were given: 1. It is necessary to supplement the technological
regulations, by foreseeing particular (defined) actions of the staff and
necessary measures to be taken in the event of change in technological
parameters and disruption of technological processes. 2. The control of evaluation of technical condition of
pipelines, detection of shortcomings and violations, regulation of application
of diagnostic measures and methods, elimination of defects and violations and
procedures for carrying out repairs was strengthened. 3. In order to ensure safe operation of technological
equipment for oil processing, prepare studies for the risk analysis of possible
accidents at omissis, clarify accident elimination plans and the
safety report. 4. In order to ensure safe operation of technological
devices for oil processing, cover the supporting metal constructions of
analogous devices with fire-proof material. 5. The time between repairs of devices may only be prolonged
after modernising the device or strengthening the testing and inspection system. 6. Install video monitoring systems of dangerous equipment. "

In 2015, stared the procedure for reviewing the permit. The Minister's decision is cancel the Seveso permit in 2016, which the operator appeals against. By Decision No. 10349 of 03.08.2018, the appeal of Videx AD against Decision No. 62/2016 was dismissed and entered into force on 29.11.2018. As a result of this the operator was obliged to reduce the total quantity of hazardous substances available on the site may not exceed the threshold quantities of 50 tonnes of explosive substances alone and in the composition of articles. From 2015-2018 discharge (disposal, delaboration) was suspended, no production activity was allowed and is not expected to be renewed in the future. At the end of 2018, the procedure for removal of ammunition received for utilisation from the Republic of Greece was completed - 190 570 mines were exported back.

217,1021,Major Accident,"Production, destruction and storage of explosives",Incident by ignition of a 81 mm mortar round,2010-09-07 08:10:00,2010-09-07 12:00:00,"On 7th September 2010, a fire occurred in the final assembly building generating a series of explosions seriously damaging the building and damaging a specific part of the area. The incident was caused by the ignition of an 81 mm HE M512A1 mortar round during the final packing operation.One side of the pallet assembly was filley with 54 projectiles of 81mm. The problem occured while closing the transport containers of the mortar rounds. The mortar rounds are transported in plastic containers that hold 3 mortar rounds in seperate tubes. The operator experienced difficulties in loading the round into the containers and closing the container caps.The mortar round sometimes protruded more than normal from the plastic container and this made it more difficult to fit the retaining cap, to rotate it and to align it correctly. A gap remained between the container and the cap.The operator found that striking the retaining cap of the container with a mallet was enough to align it and to allow the cap to be locked in position. According to the operator, the incident occurred when he struck the remaining cap with a mallet due to it being difficult to align and rotate.This was not the first time that the operator used the mallet to close the cap. One of the two operators at the packing operation had done the loading operation before but could not be considerd highly experienced since he was drafted in to performe this operation from another area of the site (machining).","The primary cause was that the operator have strike the retaining cap of the container with a mallet to align it and to allow the cap to be locked in position.​The poor and out of specification neoprene compressibility and incorrectly seated sleeve explain why containers were difficult to close.Several tests have been made to determine how a mallet shock through the container cap initiated the primary cartridge and how the propulsion system of the mortar round could be ignited. Based on all test results, it's not possible that the mallet impact on the container cap caused the primary charge to ignite. The identified root cause is the ignition of the primer of the propulsion system of a mortar round by direct impact with the mallet onto the anvil. As all the containers of the pallet were filled with mortar rounds, it was demonstrated that it is highly probable that the operator directly but unintentionally hit the adjacent round during the closing container cap operation and made the primer function.Secondary causes are related with behavior, formation and management reaction on the operator's reports of problems (operators have already said to the management that problems existed with the containers but nothing was changed and they continued to use a mallet).",Damages to building and area onsite.No dead and no real injury : 2 persons chocked and one blasted were sent to hospital but were released immediatelyOne school was evacuated.One speedway was closed during some hours.,"The two operators evacuated seeing the beginning of fire.The site was evacuated.External fire brigade was onsite but could'nt attack fire because of danger. They 've waited until all the projectiles have exploded (counting deflagrations). An helicopter was send above the desaster.Afterthe fire and explosions, mine-clearing experts were send to restore the place and make it safe.","The incident analysis has demonstrated that the root cause is human factor and mainly a behaviour/training problem (mallet shock on the igniter). So, all the people working in energetic processes have received two days training on behavior and safety with energetic products.More attention has to be given to reports of problems coming from workers: operators had already said to the management that problems existed with the containers but nothing was changed.The risks assemsments will be followed by implementation of actions and modifications of the work instructions and control documents in particular taking account the change notification and the integration of safety instructions. The design and loading process of the projectile in its container should be reviewd to ensure the ammunition is easy to pack and to ensure it is well maintained and safe during transportation, vibration or shock."

There was a large plume of smoke and explosions could be heard. 250 t of goods including 3.7 t of hazardous materials (including in particular flammable liquids) were destroyed in the fire.","The expert assessment revealed that the most likely root cause of the accident was a problem with the lithium-ion battery of a pallet truck and its charger.The battery might have been subject to an impact or a box placed in front of the charger might have obstructed the ventilation ports and caused the temperature to rise steadily during charging. However, the expert does not rule out a safety defect in the product.","None of the company&rsquo;s employees were injured as a result of the accident.
The building suffered major damage, with 85% of the hub being destroyed. The fire also destroyed 22 twelve-tonne trucks and 7 HGV trailers.
40 staff at the site were temporarily laid off.","The emergency services were called. They brought the fire under control and put it out at 1:10 p.m., thus saving the office building and all of the servers. The buildings with the highest risk profile (due to being used to store hazardous materials) were not affected. Soaking of the area continued until the next day. The firewater was collected in retention tanks. The initial atmospheric measurements did not reveal any particular impact from the accident.
The road passing in front of the building was closed and a diversion was put in place.
Four homes were locked down as a precaution.
After the event, the prefect issued an order imposing emergency measures regulating the management of the waste and firewater and ordering dispersion modelling of the plume. The conditions for the parcel/pallet delivery service to restart were also set.","For the reconstruction of the building, the operator planned to:

change the fire detection procedure (alarm siren, check to rule out false alarm);
install a sprinkler system in the building;
change the internal emergency plan (incorporating the building into the plan, changing the procedure for managing the keys to trucks);
have a battery room adapted to lithium-ion batteries.

224,382,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Release of oxygen and consequent fire in a air separation plant,2001-12-31 16:55:00,2001-12-31 18:00:00,"Release of oxygen and consequent fire in a air separation plantInitiating event/ accident dynamics: on the installation premises a release of oxygen occurred.On 31.12.2001 the oxygen flow had been redirected for a certain period of time to the cooling tower over a by-pass line. On 31.12.2001 the oxygen flow was again switched from the by-pass line to the product pipe with the aim of directing the oxygen into the storage tank. Before starting oxygen storage operations the product pipe had to be cleaned, due to the fact that the product pipe had not been used for a certain period of time and that contamination could not be excluded. The cleaning operation was performed by flushing the pipe with the product (oxygen). Due to the fact that the valve did not close correctly, oxygen was released over the pipe into the gravel bed near the tank and into the atmosphere instead of flowing into the oxygen storage tank.Switching from the by-pass line to the product pipe was made over a remote control from the control room of the other air separation unit. The monitoring system showed the opening of the flush valve and the closing of the valve after 2,5 min. In reality the flush valve was not closed. Oxygen spread over the site and it has to be assumed that it reached also the administration building at a distance of approximately 50 metres.At 16:55 h a fire broke out inside the building and an employee was killed.The fire destroyed most rooms on the ground floor and on the first floor of the building.The fire detectors responded in rapid sequence, it has therefore to be assumed that the fire spread very rapidly. The fire brigade brought the fire rapidly under control and extinguished it.A collaborator was inside the building when the fire broke out because one of the plant operators had requested him to check directly on-site the alarm signal released by an analysing device. The analyser indicated an oxygen content in the nitrogen cooling circuit near to the threshold value of 0,3 ppm. A defect in the analyser was suspected.The collaborator instructed to check the analysis came into the installation at 16:00 and controlled the corresponding analysis. He contacted the control room communicating that no errors could be found and his intention to leave the installation.Shortly after the fire detectors responded.The oxygen content measurement in the nitrogen cooling circuit of the air separator is an essential control parameter for the cooling process. The values measured do not give any clue with regards to the oxygen content of the ambient air in the surroundings.","The oxygen, nitrogen and argon gases produced in the plant are
transferred at cryogenic temperatures to the storage tanks. The gases
are stored there until delivery.
Air separation is a continuous process (rectification), the
rectification process always produces the above mentioned gases. It is
not possible to stop the production of one of these gases when the
plant is operating. The plant was running on oxygen-production, when
the accident occurred.Known causes: According to present knowledge the oxygen release was caused by the flush valve which was not closed correctly. For the time being it has to be assumed that the flush valve remained open for approximately 8 hours and that during that period of time oxygen was released in the environment instead of flowing into the storage tank. 
Probably the pneumatic valve, which was opened by compressed air, did not close correctly because the relief pipe for the expansion of the compressed air was iced up, due to atmospheric conditions and did not allow the compressed air to expand.
The display on the control monitor indicated erroneously that the valve was closed not allowing the personnel to identify the failure.
Investigation showed that the valve was not equipped with an end point control device. The display on the monitor was not given by the real position of the flush valve, but by the set flush time. The display on the valve position changes from ""open"" to ""closed"" after a set flushing time has lapsed. The real position of the flush valve was not monitored. With the existing monitoring system it was not possible to detect that the valve was not correctly closed.
The icing of the compressed air relief pipe of the flush valve was probably due to an insufficient sizing of the pipe cross-section. Humidity could not be sufficiently discharged, adhering water droplets did not dissolve due to cohesion phenomena.  The compressed air could not expand due to the icing of the relief pipe and the flush valve did not close correctly.
The main accident cause  was the control system set-up.
Cause classification: atmospheric conditions (icing of the relief pipe), incomplete control of the flush valve position.

The pipe-line connecting the tank to the mixer had previously been connected during production tests to another piping system with a connection to the sewage water tank. It was planned to dismantle the new connection to the sewage water tank for the test production.At the same time as change of production operations were performed in one part of the plant, the control system of the installation part (equipment) not needed for the new production process was tested with pressurised water. The connection to the sewage water tank was maintained for that purpose.Immediately before beginning the new production process and pumping operations, two employees walked along the pipe-line to check independently of each other the connection between the tank and the mixing vessel.They did not discover the faulty connection to the sewage water tank, this may be due to the complexity of the piping system and to the recent fact of the connection to the sewage water tank.After starting pumping operations the stirring vessel was monitored for&nbsp; the amount of incoming polychloro-acetone directly on the stirrer and from the control room. The level increase in the stirring vessel was monitored from the control room. An additional crosscheck between outflow of the tank and inflow of the stirrer had not been considered necessary because of the low flow-rate which had been chosen.Announcements over the loudspeaker system by the on-site fire brigade were not audible in that part of the installation.",not given,Safety functions: Redirection of the flow into the retention pond.Emergency measures: Protective measures- Shut down of the pumping operation and of the waste water tank- redirection of the flow to the retention pond- abatement of vapours at the entry of the retention pond by the on-site fire brigade- rinsing and neutralising of the sewage water channel affected- neutralising the content of the retention pond,Measures to prevent recurrence:- organisational measures to ensure that only pipes containing process water are connected to the sewage water tank;- systematic safety assessment of the event of the sewage water system and implementation of the measures suggested by the safety assessment.

All the remotely controlled devices remained fixed in the position of that moment and some valves, that could have been closed manually, remained opened. As those valves were necessary for the isolation of the various sections of the production chain, the solution passed from the oxidation to the extraction step and back again via the pipeline.- 23:09: An abrupt increase of temperature (from 70 to 200°C in less than 5 minutes) and pressurisation of the accident section caused the rupture of the connecting pipeline. The pipeline rupture was then immediately followed by the fire of the released solution.- 23:30: Arrival of first aid and emergency intervention teams.- 01:29: The fire was extinguished.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide resulted in the pressurization and the following rupture of the pipeline connecting the oxidizer to the extractor.

CAUSES: 
The most probable cause for the pipeline rupture was the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (gaseous oxygen formation and temperature/pressure increase) due to the presence of unstabilizing agents in suspension (metallic particles, rust). The initiating event was the failure of the automatic control devices together with a series of human errors during the attempt to repair them. Particularly, the safety procedures followed were not suitable for the event. Furthermore these procedures were not fully applied. Some valves, that could be manually closed, remained opened. As those valves were necessary for the isolation of the various sections of the production chain, the solution passed from the oxidation to the extraction step and back again via the pipeline. The overflowing of the fire extinction water to the natural environment was due to the under-dimensioning of the containment basin designed for this purpose.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:1 person was killed by the explosion whilst 2 people were injured by the release.MATERIAL LOSS:The accident caused the destruction of 25% of the installations (about 1,000 m2) that is 2/3 of one of the two production units.

The context was the following:
The reaction basket was reassembled and placed in the charging area of the reactor, which is slightly set back in respect of a pit containing water used to wash materials. The safety basket was then extracted. It contained liquid magnesium and emitted white smoke and an intense glow. For an unknown reason, the liquid magnesium flowed from the safety basket into the washing pit.
About 14:15 h an explosion was caused by the vaporisation and decomposition of the water as well as the decomposition and combustion of the magnesium in the air. According to the expert designated by the competent authorities, the explosion was caused by the violent expansion of the significant volume of gas generated by the evaporation of the water caused by its contact with liquid magnesium.

The firefighting water was collected using sludge suction equipments and taken to Kommune-kemi.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Favourable wind and weather conditions.The accident occurred during lunch time and nobody was present. Based on the investigations, it seems that an air/styrene vapours explosive mixture, contained in a small pressure vessel holding gelcoat, was ignited, resulting in an internal overpressure and to the ejection of burning gases through the safety valve. The burning gases partially melted the safety valve and initiated a fire which spread very rapidly over the building. As two storage vessels containing styrene were located in the affected area, a large release of styrene was threatened. This led to a temporary evacuation of the plant and warning of local external population. 60 people were evacuated from their houses located to the south-east of the factory.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
Based on the available information, it has been concluded that an explosive mixture of air/styrene vapours in the pressure pot containing gelcoat (mixture of 60% polyester and 40% styrene) was ignited, probably due to static electricity. The burning gases were released through the safety valve installed on the pot and partially melted the valve itself, initiating a fire which spread very rapidly over the building.

CAUSES:
When the gelcoat should be applied it was pressed out from the pressure pot through a hand operated valve by compressed air. As styrene has a vapour pressure of 6 mbar at 20°C, a flammable/explosive mixture with air may be expected in the pressure pot during operation but it not was not considered. The liquid gelcoat was in the pot placed in a plastic bucket, providing a possible source of static electricity.",EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:60 people were evacuated from their houses located to the south-east of the factory. 29 people of the emergency teams were mobilized during the accident. No data are available about the number of the factory's workers involved.MATERIAL LOSS:The production hall was damaged by the fire. The cost of the damages have been evaluated in about 5-6 million DKR (about 0.6-0.75 MECU).Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the fire brigade arrived, first priority was given to the cooling of 2 gelcoat storage vessels inside the building to prevent the release of toxic styrene vapours.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Municipality blocked the drains by using inflatable barriers placed at the outflow. Due to the risk of release of toxic gases, 60 people were temporarily evacuated from their houses located to the south-east of the factory. 29 people of the emergency teams were mobilized.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Due to the heating caused by the fire, the gelcoat in the 2 storage vessels was polymerized and, therefore, cutting of these vessels before transportation to the waste treatment facility was necessary. The cutting operation had to be performed under water jets to avoid the risk of a new fire.MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:After the accident, the following measures were established:1- if solvents, which may form an explosive mixture with pressurized air are being used in the pressure vessel, an inert gas should be used as a propellant;2- all components of the equipment should be properly earthed."
238,867,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Flammable gas leak at petrochemical installation,2015-04-25 13:00:00,2015-04-25 18:00:00,"On Saturday 25/04/2015 at about 13h00, a major leak occurred as a result of the catastrophic failure of the nuts on the studs connecting the bonnet and the body of a 2” manual drain valve in a blow down line. The bonnet was ejected from the valve body, creating a 2” opening in the system to atmosphere. Nobody was injured and no ignition of the flammable gas occurred.
The system was stopped, isolated and decompressed to flare. At around 18h00, the pressure in the system has dropped sufficiently to start maintenance works to replace the damaged valve. In total about 45 tons of flammable gas was released to atmosphere.","History of 2” drain valveLittle information is available about the history of the 2” drain valve. This valve is not used during normal operation of the unit, only during startup (connection for flushing with nitrogen).The following information is available:
The line was originally installed in 1984;o Works were done on the system in 2003;
The valve is installed at a height of about 4 meters above grade;o Works on this type of valves can only be done during turnarounds;
The construction of the valve (bonnet kept in place with 4 bolts) does not allow works to be done in run;
There are no records about repairs of the valve;o According to the original specifications, the 2” drain valves should be a carbon steel drain valve. However, the installed valve is a stainless steel valve.
It is not clear whether the valve that failed on 25/04/2015 is the originally installed valve or whether the original valve has been replaced or worked on during one of the turnarounds between 1984 and 2015. Possibly, the carbon steel nuts were installed during one of these turnarounds. As a result of previous incidents with valve packing followers, a visual verification of isolation valves in stainless steel systems was launched prior to the incident on 25/04/2015. The 2” drain valve that failed on 25/04 was in the scope of this verification and some comments were reported about the status of the valve:
No ice formation o Corrosion of bolts
Incident investigation results
Investigation of the failed valve shows clearly advanced corrosion of the nuts of the studs connecting the bonnet and body of the valve. The following construction materials were encountered:o The bonnet and body of the valve are constructed from austenitic stainless steel (316);
The valve is installed on a line constructed of low temperature carbon steel;
The 4 studs used to connect the bonnet and body of the valve are constructed of ferritic stainless steel (410);
The 8 nuts on the studs connecting the bonnet and body of the valve are constructed of carbon steel;The following conclusions can be drawn upon investigation of the recovered valve:
The severe corrosion of the 8 carbon steel nuts on the 4 stainless steel studs/valve (see Figure 8) is consistent with a combination of galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion of the nuts.
The 4 stainless steel studs of the valve bonnet/body connection are in good condition.o Some of the nuts are missing because they were torn off during the ejection of the valve bonnet.o It is possible that the severely corroded nuts (including the missing nuts) were all located at the same side of the valve bonnet/body connection (back side).
According to the original specification, the 2” drain valve should have been a low temperature carbon steel valve instead of a stainless steel valve.o Besides carbon steel nuts on the studs of the valve bonnet/body connection, carbon steel nuts were also discovered on the studs of the valve flange/body connection (the 8 nuts on the blind flange are a mix of carbon steel nuts and stainless steel nuts. The carbon steel nuts are corroded.).
Upon ejection of the bonnet of the 2” drain valve, the bonnet hit a nearby propylene pipeline. This propylene pipe was hit in an horizontal plane above the horizontal plane of the original location of the 2” drain valve, suggesting that the nuts that failed first were the ones located on the bottom half of the bonnet/body connection.
Extensive corrosion of carbon steel nutsThe catastrophic failure of the carbon steel nuts of the valve bonnet/body connection occurred because of severe corrosion of the carbon steel nuts on the stainless steel studs.The extensive corrosion of the carbon steel nuts is a combination of galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion.
Installation of stainless steel valve with stainless steel studs in low temperature carbon steel line
The line was originally installed in 1984. According to the original specification, the 2” drain valve should have been a low temperature carbon steel valve. However, the installed valve was made of austenitic stainless steel (316). It is possible that the valve that failed is the originally installed valve.
Installation of carbon steel nuts on stainless steel studs of stainless steel 2” valveWorks on this type of valves can only be done during turnarounds since the construction of the valve (bonnet kept in place with 4 bolts) does not allow works to be done in run. There are no records about repairs of the valve (records were checked until 1998). It is not clear whether the valve that failed on 25/04/2015 is the originally installed valve or whether the original valve has been replaced or worked on during one of the turnarounds between 1984 and 2015. Possibly, the carbon steel nuts were installed during one of these turnarounds.
Valve in humid environment
The valve is constantly in a wet environment due to the condensation of water vapor in ambient air. The presence of this wet environment is a necessary condition for both galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion to occur (presence of electrolyte).
Nuts not protected against atmospheric corrosionThe carbon steel nuts were not protected against atmospheric corrosion (e.g. by paint or selection of corrosion resistant material).
Nuts in carbon steelThe nuts used to tighten the stainless steel studs were made of carbon steel.
Condensation of water vapor in airThere is a constant condensation of water vapor in air at the location of the valve due to the low temperature of the fluid in the low temperature carbon steel line and because of the lack of thermal insulation on the valve.
Installation of valve not meeting specificationsIt is not unusual to install equipment parts made of more noble materials in systems made of less noble materials, provided that the compatibility of the materials is checked and that appropriate measures are taken to avoid galvanic corrosion.
Valve not thermally insulatedThe valve is installed in a thermally insulated low temperature carbon steel line. The valve as such was not insulated.
Process at -6°C. The valve is installed in an insulated low temperature carbon steel line. The operating temperature of the fluid in the line is about -6°C.
Inspection of lineThe 2” drain valve was part of lines that are inspected inside the RBI scope. The line with the valve that failed was assessed to lie in the low risk area of the RBI matrix. The lines in this low risk area are inspected by visual verification of the state of the line during site visits (frequency of these visits is every 5 years).An inspection report of this particular line from a previous inspection cycle (2009) is available. This line was scheduled to be subjected to a more detailed inspection (with thickness measurements etc.) in the next inspection cycle (to be carried out in the turnaround of 2016). A request of this more detailed inspection was applied in a pre-inspection report of end 2014. The state of the valve that failed was insufficiently detected in the visual inspections of 2009.","Large flammable gas cloud in the instalaltion. No ignition.
The accident occured during a weekend, so no maintenance work was in progress.
Wind direction was fortunately such that the cloud was directed toward a part of the installation that was out of service.","13.00

Quality control of delivered materials and equipment parts.
Quality control of installed materials in the field by additional controls (e.g. supervision, Positive Material Identification). Organization of campaign to raise awareness about galvanic corrosion
During the incident investigation, it became clear that the risks associated to galvanic corrosion are not always clearly understood by all layers of the organization. To raise understanding and awareness about galvanic corrosion hazards, a sensibilisation campaign needs to be organized by the site. Development of formal protocol for visual inspection of valves
There is no formal procedure describing the visual inspection of equipment. To improve the quality of visual inspections during site visits, a formal protocol needs to be developed to describe the requirements related to visual inspection. This formal protocol needs to include specific a measurable acceptance criteria for each of the inspected equipment. Gas detection
The gas detection system in the installation gave a quick warning of the leak allowing prompt action by the unit operators. It took a long time to depressurise the section of the installation with the leak. Partly because of the white cloud formed by the leak that didn't allow visual verification of the leak origin. Partly because there was no block valve on the top of the destillation colomn to which the leaking valve was connected. Therefore also the following equipement needed to be depressurised. The need for an additional block valve is still under investigation."
239,436,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Accident at a cadmium distillation column in a zink refinery,1993-07-16 12:25:00,1993-07-16 00:00:00,"The accident involved a cadmium distillation column. The column was
formed by a stack of 59 silicon carbide trays heated to 1000°C. The
heating chamber enclosing the bottom of the distillation column was
kept depressurised.
The temperature was monitored at different points of the distillation
unit, and the temperature control was assured by regulating manually
both the gas flow to the burners and the draught. The essential
maintenance task was to absorb zinc oxides releases which occurred
relatively frequently between the trays, fouling the installation.&nbsp; The
cleaning operation was performed through inspection openings on the
walls of the heating chamber, which were closed during operation with
refractory plugs and sealed with clay. This operation was performed by
refractory bricklayers employed by the company or by a specialised
subcontractor.
Independently, the columns were operated permanently during 18 months.
Any shut-down or significant drop in temperature would have caused the
rupture of the trays, particularly sensitive to thermal shocks.
The accident scenario was as follows:
- 27/05/1993: 7 weeks before the event, start-up of the column in which
the accident originated after refurbishment (new tray stack, new flues)
- 24/06/93: start of the effective production phase
- 24/06/93: 17:00 h an abnormal rumbling noise which had never been
heard before in a refurbished installation, alerted the operators. An
inspection showed a temperature rise in the heat exchanger and a
significant fouling.
- 25/06/93: during the morning before the event, several operations
were carried out without success to re-establish normal operating
conditions.
- 25/06/93: at 12:10 h a sudden divergence of the lateral temperatures was observed in the heating chamber.
- 25/06/93: at 12:25 h 11persons (production manager, workshop manager,
experienced employees, temporary personnel, refractory bricklayers from
a subcontractor) were located near the column when the accident
occurred. ","Different assumptions can be made concerning the causes of the accident:1. - The fouling of the combustion chamber caused by considerable zinc oxides releases, lead to an incomplete combustion process and the formation of non-combusted gas pockets, which exploded when fresh air was supplied by the opening of inspection openings or of the flues.2. - The oxygen impoverishment of the oven permitted a direct reaction of the zinc released by the leaking column and the carbon dioxide present. This reaction is very exothermic.3. - The simultaneous opening of several inspection openings extinguished the burners causing a collapse of several trays and an uncontrolled vaporisation of the zinc.","The explosion first caused the projection of a series of lids (plugs) due to a violent internal overpressure. A muffled explosion noise was perceived by the personnel in the control room some dozen metres from the column. A burning gas cloud was emitted by the column, forming a white fog which diffused in a few minutes in the whole workshop.Human losses were very high: the 11 persons present were seriously burned, 10 died in the following minutes, hours or days, the only survivor suffered 90% burns.","The explosion was violent. The intervention of on-site emergency response systems could not be made.
External emergency response services could only evacuate the victims.","Investigations were carried out. The reconstruction and operation of the column was subjected to an improvement of the operating rules and procedures concerning the installation of new trays, the checking of the factors linked to temperature rises, the detection of failures and the release of alarm, the emergency measures, personal protection measures on the most exposed workplaces."
240,1028,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion in a plant for the production of basic plastic materials,2011-10-23 21:04:00,2011-10-23 00:00:00,"On 23 October 2011, at about 21.00, a fire occurred at a plant used for the polymerisation of alpha-Methylstyrene (AMS) with acrylonitrile (ACN) with the help of the radical initiator azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), following a deflagration when pouring the radical initiator AIBN into a preparation tank with AMS.
Emergency services were activated, the fire was extinguished by the on-site fire service, and all of the facility’s systems were shut down by 22.40. One worker suffered serious burns during the incident. The fire caused extensive damage to the facility, in particular to the electrical cables and data communication. According to statements made by the plant manager, material damage amounted to about €3 million to €4 million. The investigation found that the incident was caused by unforeseen excess pressure in a preparation tank for a radical initiator.
During a filling procedure, AIBN was released in the form of a dust cloud, which then ignited, injuring the employee working in the area. A second deflagration occurred when three open AIBN drums, which were near the reactor, ignited. This second deflagration was stronger than the first, and caused the extensive damage to cables and an electrical room. When the process control system activated the alarm, the system was shut down to put it in a safe condition. All input of material ceased, and the remaining reaction heat in the reactor was removed as quickly as possible using water in the cooling circuit.
Within about 30 minutes the remaining initiator was used up, polymerisation stopped and the reactor cooled to room temperature. Sequence of events:
19 October 2011
Following a stoppage, the reactor was put back into operation and approximately 400 litres of AMS/ACN solution was poured in to seal the output pumps. Various problems with the ACN intake valves, as well other system valves, led to operation being suspended so that the intake system could be examined.
It was subsequently established that the problems were caused by a faulty software update to the DCS system. As a result, the software update was repeated without further problems. The software error itself is not considered to be the cause or a contributing aspect of the incident. 23 October 2011
13.30: For the current production in the reactor, a new starting solution was created; the system was working normally, with no signs of any anomalies. 20.13: The shift workers determined that the reactor (due to the above problem of the inoperative intake system) was showing a pressure of 3 bars. A manual valve was opened to release pressure from the tank into the emergency release tank.
The shift workers were not aware, nor could they have noticed, that releasing pressure from the reactor led to a pressure build-up in the emergency release tank.
A subsequent calculation of the pressure patterns showed that the decrease in pressure in the reactor from 3 bars at 20.14 to 2.1 bars at 21.03 led to an increase in pressure in the emergency release tank from 1 bar to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.25: The growing pressure in the emergency release tank reached 1.2 bars, causing the white oil contained in the immersion tank to be pushed into the preparation tank.
This assumption was confirmed by analyses of the contents of the preparation tank after the incident, which revealed the presence of white oil. Furthermore, in the gas phase of the preparation tank, organic compounds (acrylonitrile) were detected. This shows that the gas phases of the emergency release tank and of the preparation tank were connected and at the same pressure level at this time. The pressure in this combined system continued to grow to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.30: A worker left the measuring station to prepare the next batch of AIBN starting solution to be added to the preparation tank. He removed four drums of AIBN from storage and placed them on a trolley, removed all four lids and placed the first drum in the drum tipper. This was normal procedure. Approx. 20.50: The first drum was swung over the preparation tank and the slide valve on the tank was opened. As the second slide valve opened, a dust cloud issued from the funnel of the drum tipper, ignited and injured the worker, who at that point was standing at the drum tipper’s control panel. A reconstruction of this situation shows that, when the second slide valve on the drum was opened, the excess pressure of 1.7 bars in the preparation tank lifted the drum out of the funnel by at least a few centimetres. The excess pressure blew the powdered AIBN out of the drum and into the surrounding area, leading to a dust cloud, which subsequently ignited. This ignition could have happened one of two ways:
a) A brush discharge onto metal parts can lead to ignition of the mixture of AIBN powder and the gas phase containing organic components, or
b) Ignition caused by brush discharge onto the inner lining of the drum.
Both possibilities could arise from the drum being lifted up by the excess pressure and the resulting gap between the drum and the funnel, if a highly charged dust cloud with a high gas velocity issues from the gap. 21.03: The shift workers at the measuring station heard an explosion and saw multiple gas detector alerts on their screens. In front of the measuring station, they found the injured worker, who was wet from the emergency shower when he came into the measuring station. They noticed a large fire in the area of the drum tipper and immediately alerted the fire service and the emergency doctor.
Because of the fire and the damage done to the cables, most of the DCS information was cut off.
The investigation after the incident showed that the injured worker had most likely opened all four drums and left the lids on a shelf on the wall.
The drum, which had been swung over the preparation tank, exhibited a large hole and was empty, and the metal rings of the other drums were found near the trolley that had been used to transport the drums from storage to the drum tipper. It is clear that, a couple of minutes after the first fire occurred, the fire caused by the dust cloud had ignited the other three drums (this was the explosion heard by the shift workers) and the cables on the wall behind the drums. 21.11: The on-site fire service fought the fire; all other persons evacuated the building.
The cables on the wall bracket led to the central electrical room, behind the wall and one floor up. Some of the cables passed through the wall through sand traps, which were fire resistant, while others led to the electrical room through Hauff cable ducts with insufficient fire resistance. 21.36: Fire under control, worker on way to specialist clinic. 22.40: Fire extinguished, although the on-site fire service posted a fire watch until the next morning.
","System error / management error 1. Creation of the AIBN dust cloud with subsequent ignition:
When relieving the pressure in the reactor by opening the manual valve, the shift workers were not aware that that could overload the gas system of the emergency release tank. The occurrence of excess pressure in the preparation tank caused by opening a manual valve had not been taken into account in safety discussions, only excess pressure caused by the activation of safety valves had been considered; however, this should have become apparent due to the abnormal conditions in the polymerisation reactors.
This approach was also supported by technology experts. This problem was made worse by a process modification in 2008, when the exhaust gas line of the preparation tank was attached to the emergency release tank, i.e. before the perforated disk in the exhaust system leading to the vent pipe. In addition, the pressure indicators on the preparation tank were installed such that the shift worker could not see them when operating the drum tipper.
A HAZOP study was carried out on the polymerisation process; however, the preparation tank for the initiator was not taken into consideration, as it was not seen to entail a risk (due in part to the conclusion that excess pressure would be noticeable due to a disturbance in the polymerisation tank).
The recommendation was made to carry out a HAZOP study on the AIBN system when it is put back into operation. 2. Second deflagration and the larger fire with resulting damage to cables and electrical room:
Because all four AIBN drums were positioned and opened near the drum tipper, the first fire caused by the dust igniting was able to ignite a larger amount of flammable material, and the fire therefore became significantly bigger. Furthermore, the cable fire reached the electrical room through the Hauff cable ducts. The damage to the cables and in the electrical room meant that the facility was completely out of operation for longer.
The decision to include the Hauff system in the factory standard, with reference to the on-site fire service, should be re-examined in light of this incident. 3. The seriousness of the shift worker’s burns:
The worker was wearing normal work clothing which was seen as appropriate to the activities.
In light of this incident and the seriousness of the injuries he suffered because of it, the protective equipment for this activity and for the site must undergo a full review.
","Severe damage to switch rooms for certain plant components, as well as smoke and water damage.

243,1259,Near Miss,Chemical installations ,Release of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a HF production plant,2020-08-07 14:55:00,2020-08-07 18:45:00,"The pressure monitor directly connected to the HF3 daily-supply tank detected increased pressure for four seconds and sounded an alarm as a result.When the alarm goes off, the circulation line’s feed valve to the HF3 daily-supply tank closes automatically.The plant employees concluded that this brief peak in pressure was an incorrect measurement and consequently paid no further attention to it. The employees did not notice that the feed line had closed. In the process control system, the valve closing is displayed both as an alarm activation and in the associated PID.
Because the drainage pump attached to the daily-supply pump continued to operate, it drained liquid HF out of the HF3 daily-supply tank via the pipeline that was open for purposes of outgassing, in the opposite direction to the usual direction of flow, and into the HF2 production plant.Then, during the ‘condensation’ process step, two holding tanks (V1 and V2) in the HF2 production plant were filled with liquid HF from the HF3 daily-supply tank. Before the two holding tanks were unintentionally filled, they were filled to a level of 24% (equivalent to 800 kg of HF 100).Very soon, the level indication there warned that the maximum permitted fill level had been reached (100%, equivalent to 3,400 kg).
At first the plant employees suspected that there had been internal corrosion damage in the cooling system, as a result of which large amounts of cooling brine had ended up in the interior of the condensation tank. The exothermic reaction expected in such a situation did not happen, which puzzled the employees.
Then the employees took additional measures to lower the critical fill level. In addition, they tried unsuccessfully to start one of the condensation tank’s priming pumps. A second priming pump had already been removed for repair.After this, all inflows into the condensation process step were closed. After a short time, liquid HF overflowed from an inspection opening on top of the V2 holding tank.
At an outside temperature of approximately 32 °C, the liquid FH (boiling temperature 19 °C) rapidly transitions to the gas phase and quickly becomes visible as a white vapour.
Safety measures:On-site fire service alerted.Once the fire service arrived, it contained the HF emissions by using mobile and fixed water monitors.Approximately 60 kg of HF 100, heavily diluted with water, was released into the acid drain in a controlled manner via the emergency drain in the ‘condensation holding’ floor area.The employees in the plant’s own waste water treatment facility were informed of this.The automatic changeover from waste water to containment was overseen by employees and occurred without problems.No contaminated water was released into the River Neckar.","The plants were not in normal operation.
Human:

The employees categorised the activity as ‘non-dangerous’.
There was no structured risk assessment setting out special safeguards. Therefore no inspections of pipelines and instrumentation diagrams were carried out or documented.
Inadequate alarm management. The HH alarm and its line of action to the feed valve were not traced.
Insufficient observation. Neither the activated alarm nor the visual display of the feed valve closing were observed.
The connection between circulation mode and overfill of the holding tank was not recognised.

Technical:

The screw joint on the holding tank (discharge point) is unsuitable.
The pump for lowering the holding tanks’ critical fill levels is stuck.
The tank pressure measurement sends an erroneous signal (brief peak in pressure).
",Corrosion damage.,"
Deployment of on-site fire service (precipitation of fumes through the creation of water curtains using fixed and flexible water monitors).
Precautionary request for local rescue services (on standby on site).
Controlled drainage of approximately 60 kg, diluted with water, via the emergency drain in the tank floor into the acid drain in order to lower the fill level in the tanks.
Providing information to the waste water treatment facility: accumulation of diluted hydrofluoric acid.
Waste water from pH 6 on is sent to containment as a first step. In the second step, the contaminated water is again neutralised in the waste water treatment facility and the fluoride is broken down.
After the event: The contaminated plant areas are cleaned.

The corrosion damage is inspected – as needed, equipment is replaced or the corrosion protection is refurbished.","
Revise the risk analysis for the area of the HF plants.
Replace the HF inspection nozzle in conformity with the pipe class for hydrogen fluoride.
Adapt the maintenance strategy concerning feed pump replacement.
Install an additional monitor in the control room to improve alarm management.
Implement a training module for standard alarm management.
Train employees in alarm management.
Document activation measures in PIDs in the case of non-routine operating conditions.

It must be pointed out that, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HF plants were under temporary conditions. The HF2 production line was undergoing degasification in preparation for maintenance work; the HF3 production line was in circulation mode in order to prevent the pumps from becoming stuck.According to information from the operator, under normal operations these situations would not occur simultaneously. Because the possibility of mutual interference had not been investigated, the sequence of events resulting in this emission could not have been recognised in advance.

245,1294,Near Miss,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Side collision between tank wagons at a refinery loading yard,2021-10-26 06:15:00,2021-10-26 22:20:00,"On 26&nbsp;October 2021 a collision occurred during shunting operations on adjacent tracks (17 and 18) in a loading yard.A tank wagon filled with petrol tipped over and ended up on its side on an adjacent track. No spillage occurred and no one was injured.
The incident took place at around 06:15&nbsp;hrs, shortly after the handover between the night shift and the early shift. It was still dark and slightly foggy at the time of the incident; however, the loading and track areas involved were illuminated, and visibility was good.
All loading and shunting operations in this part of the facility are performed independently by a service provider. Tracks 17 and 18 together form a single work station, loading yard (A), supervised by a responsible worker.
Train convoys, each consisting of 10 tank wagons, are usually deployed in loading yard (A) on tracks 17 and 18 respectively. The tank wagons are then filled simultaneously on both tracks.A conveyor system (‘troller’) moves the tank wagons around the loading berths.
In normal operations, after the first three tank wagons (wagons 1 to 3) on each track have been filled, the filling of a fourth tank wagon begins. Additionally, the front tank wagons already filled (wagons 1 to 3) are uncoupled from the rest of the convoy (wagons 4 to 10) and a shunting locomotive moves them in the direction of the crossover (A). The ‘troller’ conveyor system remains positioned north of tank wagon No&nbsp;4 as it is filled and holds the remaining tank wagons in place. The shunting locomotive moves the first three tank wagons (Nos&nbsp;1 to 3) in the direction of the crossover (A) and the wagons are halted at a specified stopping point shortly before they reach the crossover.They are held there and thus serve as the point of contact for the tank wagons which follow later. After filling has ended, the remaining tank wagons are uncoupled from those still empty and released by the conveyor system. The slight gradient in the track area then ensures that they move independently without any crew in the direction of the ‘southern crossover’. Upon reaching the stopping point, they come to a halt against the convoy consisting of tank wagons 1 to 3. As they move south, the speed of the tank wagons is no greater than walking pace.After all the tank wagons have been filled and released in a southerly direction, the two convoys now on tracks 17 and 18 ahead of the crossover (A) are combined into a full train load and checked by an inspector before exiting the site through the rail gate.
On the day of the incident, shortened train convoys, each consisting of just 5&nbsp;tank wagons, were berthed for filling on tracks 17 and 18. This configuration is exceptional and happens only once or twice a year.
According to earlier findings, in the course of the incident on 26&nbsp;October 2021 no shunting locomotive was requested by the loaders to shunt the two filled convoys consisting of tank wagons 1 to 3. Instead, the two convoys consisting of wagons 1 to 3 were moved along tracks 17 and 18 in quick succession using the ‘troller’ conveyor system. As a result, the two released convoys began to move down the track almost simultaneously until there was contact between the sides of the two convoys approaching the crossover (A) and one of the tank wagons tipped over.
Safety measures:Shunting staff saw what had happened, alerted the emergency services and initiated the rescue chain.","Root causes:

Lack of communication and flawed, incomplete shift handover.
Lessons from previous incidents as regards shortcomings in the safety culture, leadership and shift handover were not implemented quickly enough or consistently.
Lack of communication and documentation during the shift handover, accentuated by inadequate guidelines and structure in the organisation of the shift handover process.
Unclear and insufficient definition of interfaces and responsibilities between rail service provider and refinery operator.
Insufficient lessons from incidents, in communication with lack of consistency and/or follow-up in implementing defined areas for improvement.
No other technical and/or organisational barriers to slow the tank wagons once released.

Human causes:

Shortcomings in the shift management.
These shortcomings resulted in inappropriate criticism with the result that the person filling the tank wagons subsequently was ‘not paying attention’.

The person filling the tank wagons lacked workplace risk awareness:

Lack of process planning: no review at shift handover with the person filling the tank wagons in the loading yard. No other action taken to obtain an overview of the situation in the loading yard.
Inadequate work execution: no check (visual RID* check list) at the critical uncoupling stage to ensure that a brake unit was correctly positioned.

*RID = Regulation concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail.",Damaged tank wagons and salvage costs.,"Rail operations at the affected loading berths were temporarily suspended. Emergency response by the site’s own fire service. Support/advice via an on-site ‘transport accident information and assistance system’ (Transport-Unfall-Informations- und Hilfeleistungssystem - TUIS) technical adviser.
Use of a recovery train.","Emergency actions developed and implemented in cooperation between operator and service provider, including:

A rail operations ‘safety scout’, i.e. an experienced worker from the operator, to check and advise on site, across shifts.
Additional service provider support needed on loading yard tracks 17/18 by the service provider’s shift supervisor, particularly at the beginning of shifts.
Safety devices (e.g. stop blocks) to stop tank wagons rolling away once they have been halted on track 17/18 and on track 13 to be placed at the appropriate southerly point to prevent runaway tank wagons.

Other actions:

Description and assessment of operator/service provider interfaces to identify potential managerial and communications improvements.
Consistent involvement of the service provider. Based on the interfaces found, develop points of focus and adapt stakeholder tasks at operator/service provider interfaces. In the process, monitor common operating points.
Alignment of instructions. On the aforementioned basis, supplement, update and harmonise instructions.
Review and optimise the shift handover. Clearly structure and define the content and process at shift handover with the service provider and also describe the process in the form of written instructions.
Adapt the job description for the shift manager.
Review and optimise the training process. Based on the review, adapt training so that its content and methodology are appropriate to the target groups. Here, risks and risk awareness during shunting and filling should provide the focal point.
Deploy technical safety actions to prevent runaway tank wagons (in this instance, a tank wagon brake on the track).

As described, the causes were multi-layered, inter alia the link between the incident and the shift handover. It is important at shift handover for there to be comprehensive communication about the tasks and conditions found on site at that specific moment. Appropriate standards should be established to this end and documentation produced accordingly.
Rule violations are another aspect of the incident. In routine activities, it is common for sequential short cuts or negligence to occur (wittingly or unwittingly); if undetected or without repercussions (in terms of either detecting an issue or sanctioning it), they take root and go unrectified. It is important therefore when monitoring the safety management system to ensure compliance with safety regulations and to take prompt corrective action if shortcomings are identified. Academic literature refers to a ‘drift to danger’ (Rasmussen, 1997) or to a ‘normalisation of deviance’ (Vaughan, 1996). The ‘drift to danger’ caused by external pressures or the acceptance of ‘deviances’ because they have not resulted in ‘disasters’ are a major challenge for complex organisations, in particular those dealing with hazardous substances and processes. A robust, mature safety culture can counter this by establishing unequivocal values which are exemplified by management and by promoting open communication in all directions.
The fact that a service provider’s actions caused the incident shows that interfaces between operator, service provider and monitoring are particularly important for allowing the service provider to take the appropriate safety action."

A short circuit exposed the exhaust air pipe (above the defective fluorescent tube), linked to the  ventilation system of the equipment, to thermal stress. The energy released by the catalytic reaction of Pt-, Pd-, Rh- salts/dust deposits in the exhaust air pipe set the whole pipe on fire. The exhaust air ventilator on fifth floor pulled the fire upstairs overriding the fire dampers.On 06/07/00 a fire occurred in an intermediate ceiling of the second floor of the installation in question.The professional fire brigade and the onsite firefighting service were notified at the same time. The fire was extinguished rapidly and was declared extinguished.During the subsequent control smoke was detected at the door on the second floor leading to the ventilation shaft. After opening the door it appeared that a fire was spreading rapidly towards the ventilation control station in the fifth floor.On the roof of the five storey building the openings of the ventilation system are located.In the north-eastern zone of the building (contact area with the neighbouring building) the development of strong smoke was detected. The smoke cloud was approximately 150-300 m high and shifted slowly towards north-east (an industrial park area).Measurements were performed around 07:25. The measurements were focused on the detection of&nbsp;&nbsp; HCN, HCL, and ammonia gases in the immediate surroundings of the burning building. All measurements were negative.On request of the Environmental Protection Agency (Umweltbundesamt), the measurements were repeated at 08:25. The measurements at the adjoining industrial park resulted in a HCL gas concentration of 20 ppm. The ERPG-2 threshold limit was therefore exceeded and the D3-notification level was released. Due to the wind direction, at no stage was the population exposed to risk. However, there was a health hazard for the employees of the industrial park, due to the high HCL gas concentration.The fire was under control around 10:00 hrs, at 11:15 hrs it was extinguished.

249,576,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Intoxicatio of workers from release of a hydrogen fluoride pipeline,2005-09-30 09:00:00,2005-09-30 09:05:00,"After the due consideration of the contradictions, the probable scenario of the accident can be summed up as follows:On the territory of the organic substances establishment of BV Rt in the storage farm for inorganic substances, hydrogen fluoride tank no. 3 (hereinafter HF3) had to be prepared for the inspection by the boiler inspector. The first phase of the preparation is the purging of the empty tank through an adsorption system, while being heated by means of an external pipe bundle. This phase was carried out from 27/09/2005 to 30/09/2005 in the morning. On September 30, 2005 one of the the shifts has started the morning shift. The shift leader assigned his workers to different jobs and establishments at the start of the shift. The plant manager starting to work at 7.30 a.m., after getting preliminary information, instructed shift leader&nbsp; to carry out the mechanical works at storage tank HF3 as a task of priority.Discussing the manpower need for this job, plant manager told to shut down the mono-nitrating plant and after finishing-off the ongoing charge, also the shutdown of fluorination plant no. 2 and he was of opinion that the manpower released in this way would be sufficient for the execution of the task. Shift leader, after the decision made by the plant manager, had the mono-nitrating plant shut down. He first sent the workers from there to the foreman to pick up tools and special protective equipment and then the workers had to contact plant manager for further assignments. Shift leader did not clearly interpret the instructions he received from the plant manager with regard to the operation of fluorination plant no.2, because he has dismissed one of the operators from there and sent him to help with the mechanical works and he did not give clear instructions to the other operator to start a new charge or to stop the operation either. The preparations of the mechanical works related to tank HF3 came to an end at about 8 o'clock. Mechanical works started under the on-site supervision and management of plant manager. Neither the plant manager, nor the workers actually involved in the works deemed it necessary to wear special protective equipment. Simultaneously with the mechanical works the actual process steps of the charge introduced in the night shift at the fluorination plant were going on. Upon the completion of those steps the operator of fluorination plant no. 2 has started to feed a new charge with HF feed, as he interpreted the instructions given by the plant manager that the plant did not need to be shut down, he was only instructed to pay more attention during the handling of the HF-valves.At about 9.00 o'clock a.m 3 works from the team carrying out the mechanical works have started to relocate a pipeline section (about 6 m long) dismantled earlier. The later victim held one end of this pipeline section in his hands. During lifting he was at the free nozzle that was connected to the HF measurement off-gas pipeline of the 2nd fluorination plant. Probably the operator of the fluorination plant no. 2 has finished the feed of HF from the measuring drum and has started the depressurization of the space inside of the drum by that time.Gases saturated with HF released trough the free nozzle have contacted the face and the upper body of the later victim. After recognizing the accident his colleagues have immediately escorted the injured to the emergency shower close to the scene, where they have showered his upper body and then at the first-aid point on the 1st floor they washed off the injured body part with Ca-lactate solution. Then they have transported the worker to the emergency room of the company doctor by forklift truck. The call center operator, on the basis of the information received from the shift leader, informed the paramedics at 9.05 who transported the injured at 9.30 from the territory of BV Rt. into the hospital. The plant manager being close to the scene when recognizing the accident has blocked the open off-gas valve of the HF measuring drum at fluorination plant no. 2. With this movement the release of gases saturated with HF through the free pipe nozzle into the atmosphere was terminated. Note: at a distance of about 0.5 m from the pipe end, in the same off-gas pipeline, there is a shut-off valve that was, on the basis of the information received from the plant manager in the course of the on-site inspection, not blocked in the moment when the accident happened and it was the plant manager who has blocked it after the accident. &nbsp;","Summary of deficiencies:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no individual procedure regulation the preparation of the HF-tank for the authority inspection.Reasons: on the basis of the previous regulations the authority shall inspect the tank every 3 years, according to the new regulations every 5 years in case of this tank. This covers individual mechanical and cleaning works that were executed always under the technical supervision of the plant manager. Though it is specified in the ""Procedure for the production of raw BTF on the fluorination production line no.1 and 2"", art. 3.3.2.2 that for the purposes of maintenance, repair the equipment, pipelines shall be opened only using the relevant protective equipment specified for the individual substances, this protective equipment is listed in detail in art. 3.8.2 for each substance. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workers received training for the individual job concerned in verbal form, the completion of this training is not documented. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requiring the people involved in the mechanical works to use the special protective equipment. The plant manager did not require before the start of the work and even after recognizing smaller abnormalities to use special protective equipment. The plant manager informed the workers on the work and on the related dangers. After being informed they did not think it was necessary to use special protective clothing and in case there was no such protective clothing, they did not refuse to work. Though it is specified in the ""Procedure for the production of raw BTF on the fluorination production line no.1 and 2"", art. 3.3.2.2 that for the purposes of maintenance, repair the equipment, pipelines shall be opened only using the relevant protective equipment specified for the individual substances, this protective equipment is listed in detail in art. 3.8.2 for each material. The collective and individual protective equipment to be made available in case of individual works are listed in the procedure MVSZ-04 as well.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transmission of information for the job was not clearThe shift leader interpreted the instructions of the plant manager improperly, and he was mistaken, as at fluorination plant no. 2 the plant manager instructed to shut down the plant after the charge feed in the night shift would be finished. The mistaken interpretation was due to the fact that the shift leader understood that he would only have to provide manpower for the mechanical works and therefore he sent only one of the operators to the mechanical works. He assigned the other operator to the further operation and he did not describe the assignment in detail. The operator at the fluorination plant no. 2 understood from the instructions of the shift leader that he would not only have to finish the ongoing charge, but he could start feeding a new charge as well. /At that time the operator of fluorination plant no. 2 was only a kind of supervision, therefore, for this activity, even one person would have been sufficient. However, for the feeding of a new charge, in case of the operation of one plant, two persons shall be assigned according to the work instructions./5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At fluorination plant no.2 there was only one person carrying out the feed of the new charge, though the operator should have known on the basis of the work instructions that in case of the operation of a plant 2 people shall be assigned to this activity. 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deficiencies of the risk assessment.Hazards associated to the handling of HF were not covered in detail. &nbsp;","One person died during hospitalization after taken to the hospital by the ambulance service, because of his face and upper body was contaminated by the corrosive and toxic hydrogen-fluoride gas.",Emergency measures taken Onsite: decontamination: containing spread of substance,"Measures to prevent recurrence: Lessons learned from the accident, actions taken, deadlines and responsible persons:The work instructions with regard to the cleaning, repair, maintenance or preparation for the authority inspections of hazardous storage tanks and equipment located within the premises of BV.

250,1125,Near Miss,"Power generation, supply and distribution ",Fire in a secondary fermenter at a biogas plant,2017-07-18 10:20:00,2017-07-18 15:00:00,"As part of maintenance work, a paddle stirrer in the secondary fermenter was replaced by an external firm on 18 July 2017.In preparation for this, the substrate was pumped out of the container and the feed, stirrer and heating were shut down as of 11 July 2017 in order to suspend gas production.
Three days before the start of the works, the tank cover was opened for ventilation. A few hours before starting installation, the contractor commenced forced ventilation with a fan.
First, the old stirrer was dismantled on 17 July 2017. On 18 July 2017, the new stirrer was installed. Since the design is such that only final assembly of the individual parts in the container can take place, it was assembled there piece by piece. Before assembly, gas was measured directly above the substrate and in the working area.During assembly, measurements were constantly taken in the working area.
In order to fit the third of four parts, the stirrer had to be rotated and became immersed in the substrate. The next part was then fitted.
It is very likely that gas was released from the substrate and was then ignited by drips from welding. This then caused a fire involving sulphur deposits, lining and individual wooden boards of the cladding.
Immediately after ignition, brief fire-fighting attempts were made with a water hose provided, but these were quickly abandoned as a result of smoke formation in the tank and the fire brigade was called, which then took charge at the plant.
Safety measures:Provision of safety staff and initial extinguishing attempts (running water), containers taken out of service and disconnected from the remaining parts of the plant.","Welding

The operator checked the control system on the pipeline, which was loaded (under pressure), without closing the manual shut-off valves (the manual valves remained open, which is inconsistent with the general safety rules). This caused liquid ammonia (about 150 kg) to get into the technological tower, evaporate and escape from the technological tower with air inlets. At that time, an employee of an external company was at the sewage pump near one of the air inlets, and found himself in a cloud of ammonia what caused serious injuries (after a few weeks he died).","Failure to keep safety procedures by the staff.

Several tanker cars were involved in the derailment. Many of the derailed cars contained&nbsp;chlorine, propane, butane, toluene and styrene. Following the derailment, several tanker cars were punctured resulting in the release of chlorine, butane and propane. The ruptured butane and propane cars experienced BLEVEs. The tanker containing approximately 90 tons (81.6 tonnes)&nbsp;of liquid chlorine was also ruptured. Large quantities of chlorine escaped, either consumed in the BLEVE flames or converted to chlorine gas and released to air. An evacuation order for the initial accident area was issued early in the morning&nbsp;of November 11, 1979. The evacuation zone was continuously expanded because of shifting winds. At its peak, 218000 of a total population of 284000 were evacuated. The evacuation order was lifted for most people after several days; however, 72000 evacuees were required to remain evacuated until November 16.While fighting the resultant flames of the derailment, the decision was made to let the flaming propane tanks burn out and wait for the tank cars to cool before attempting to stablize the scene and remove the remaining quantities of liquid chlorine. In total, approximately 80 tons (72.5 tonnes) of liquid chlorine was released during the accident or consumed during the accompanying fires. After the scene had been stablized, the remaining 10 tons (9.1 tonnes) of liquid chlorine were pumped to secured tank cars.&nbsp; There weren't any deaths or significant injuries as a result of this incident.",A lack of lubrication in a wheel bearing on a rail car&nbsp;caused an increase in friction and overheating of a journal box at&nbsp;one end of the axle. Friction burned the journal bearing causing the stub of the axle to break off&nbsp;resulting in&nbsp;the&nbsp;loss of one of its four axles and the derailment of several rail cars.,"Derailment resulted in large scale evacuation of 270,000 residents.

256,503,Major Accident,Agriculture,Ammonium nitrate fire and explosion in a warehouse of a tree plantation,2003-10-02 16:15:00,2003-10-02 20:00:00,"Fire fighters had been fighting a fire in a 300m² warehouse of a tree plantation for 45 minutes when at 17:00 an explosion occurred. 23 people were injured, 3 fire fighters were very seriously injured.This accident is classified at level 4 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive because of the evacuation of 60 people living in the vicinity for four days. The accident is notified due to its relevance concerning lessons to be learned: risks related to ammonium nitrates and emergency response related measures.",The ammonium nitrates stored could be the cause of the accident starting. The 2 gas bottles cannot be by themselves the  cause of the accident. The explosion of a light-bulb as releasing factor of the fire was hypothesiseded (light switch found in ON position).,Twenty-three persons including 18 fire-fighters were injured. Nine fire-fighters were seriously injured and three fire-fighters were injured very seriously and were still hospitalised after 18 days. Windows were broken in the village up to several hundred meters distance. Roofs and cars were damaged within a radius of 800 m. The fire propagated after the explosion emitting a big black smoke-cloud.,"The emergency-response plan was released at maximum-alert level (red). Several dozen emergency response vehicles, 4 helicopters, a team with rescue dogs, an advanced medical post and 150 fire-fighters for support were sent out. The fire was brought under control at about 20:30 hrs. 94 inhabitants were evacuated and a security perimeter of 300 to 400 m diameter and a security service were set up and maintained all night. A psychological support unit, which was set up from October 3, was consulted by more than a hundred people. Approximately 60 inhabitants were allowed to return to their homes after 4 days. A judicial investigation was carried out. The security and monitoring service was disbanded by the police 11 days after the explosion.","Ammonium nitrates could be the cause of the explosion. In addition to the compliance with regulations for the storage of this kind of products several organisms (professional trade unions, insurances..) publish recommendations concerning the storage of these products for establishments not subject to the Seveso Directive. The presence of these substances has to be known and taken into account in case of an emergency response action. The communication problems which were reported were also due to the absence of coverage by the mobile phone network."
257,1092,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire in a vacuum distillation column in a refinery,2017-05-17 11:35:00,2017-05-17 11:35:00,"On 17 May 2017 a fire broke out at the refinery site due to the spontaneous ignition of iron sulfide in a vacuum column of the Atmospheric crude oil and vacuum distillation unit.
Course of events‘A vacuum distillation was shut down as part of a planned interim stoppage.The maintenance stoppage is undertaken as an ‘intermediate stop’ in the middle of the running time of 6 years or so between two full-scale shutdowns of the whole refinery, for example to change catalysts that cannot be run at sufficient power for 6 years.
In the lower part of the vacuum column (Zone Bed 6), coke deposits build up during operation, which gradually reduces the material flow through the bed, which means that the performance of the column diminishes. For this reason, it was planned, inter alia, to replace bed 6.This work is carried out routinely every three years. The column has already undergone similar maintenance five times in the past.
In the run-up to the maintenance stoppage, there were no particular changes to the vacuum column. The pressure loss through the packing had reached the expected value. The yield structures at the end of the operating period also show that operation was undisrupted and as expected during the past running period. There was no difference in the material load compared to previous maintenance intervals; the refinery processes a fairly constant crude oil quality. In particular, there were no elevated concentrations of sulfur.
The column system was shut down in accordance with the shutdown procedure.
Subsequently, in accordance with a prior risk assessment, the preparatory works for opening the column were carried out.
The heading ‘Cleaning of the column by a specialist firm (decontamination)’ is of particular importance. This procedure involves pressurising the column with steam and water, to which a treatment product is added. The specialist firm promises that this will deactivate pyrophoric iron sulfide in the column (FeS2).Iron sulfide always forms in such columns to varying degrees depending on the sulfur concentration in the crude oil and the running parameters of the column.However, as this had been stable during the preceding running periods, it can be concluded that the mass of pyrophoric iron sulfide present is roughly the same. As the iron sulfide formed in the vacuum column has pyrophoric properties when exposed to air, this step is carried out before the column is opened in order to avoid a fire when oxygen enters.
This procedure was also successfully completed in previous maintenance stoppages.It is a standard practice in the industry.The instructions to the contractor given via the work authorisation slip and work package preparation in the stoppage planning software stipulated that after opening the lower and upper manholes to vent the column, manholes 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11 would also be opened.
In the daily instructions to the company for 16 May 2017, the manhole covers were to be put into place after opening manholes 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11. (Explanatory note: As the manhole covers are very heavy, swivel devices are sometimes used to move them. Putting into place in this context means that the manhole lids are swivelled back to their original position, but are not secured by bolts. A narrow gap remains between the manhole cover and the column.)The instructions also stated that if it proved necessary to run water through the head recirculation line, manhole 11 would have to be closed with two bolts.
This part of the instruction was not correctly carried out and all manhole lids were wide open on the morning of 17 May 2017.
Preparations for entering and carrying out the work inside continued.At 11:38 on 17 May 2017, a smouldering fire was reported inside the vacuum column. The evacuation of the installation triggered by the alarm was disciplined and speedy.
At 11:40, the fire brigade was at the scene to investigate the situation. It was found that the escape route of three members of the maintenance contractor’s staff on a platform at the head of the column was not free. In response, the refinery’s site emergency plan was put into effect at 11:44. Neighbouring businesses, authorities and the public were immediately informed.
The fire brigade maintained visual contact with the three employees until they were rescued and used water to fight the fire and cool the column from outside. At 12:55, the employees were able to be rescued using a nearby crane with a passenger bucket. The delay was caused by the fact that the crane operator had quite properly left the plant during the evacuation and a new crane operator had to be called.At 13:14, the emergency doctor was able to carry out an initial examination of the people who had been rescued. Together with the crane operator and five other production and fire service staff, they were taken to nearby hospitals as a precaution. The last staff were released from hospital the following day.
The fire was extinguished by feeding in steam from the bottom and firewater from the top.At 14:50 the fire was under control and the refinery’s emergency plan was stood down. A post-fire inspection was organised.",Spontaneous ignition of pyrophoric iron sulfide.,"Column internals damaged, EUR 2,000,000 damage","Evacuation of the plant area and then of the entire process area, safety intervention by the plant fire brigade, activation of the emergency plan, D1 notification to district control centre, etc., information to neighbouring businesses via DACS and information to local residents.
Repairs to the affected parts of the equipment and testing of the equipment by the authorised testing bodies under the supervision of a Section 29 expert prior to it being put back into service.","Optimisation of the decontamination procedure for pyrophoric substances in sub-installations.
Measures laid down for repairs:

Prerequisite for entry (inter alia): an erected crane with the means to accept passengers and a crane operator are available (secondary escape route/means of rescue for staff on the column if the way down is blocked).
Detailed instructions for opening manholes.
Detailed response to the risk of spontaneous ignition by means of various measures, including keeping the beds moist.
Plans for a gas monitoring system with remote monitoring for early detection of a fire.
Additional gas analysis as cross-check.
Temperature control in the column.
Provide a clear indication of the placing and securing of manhole lids 11, 8 and 5 so that, in the event of a fire, there is no leakage of firewater and fire-fighting is effective.
Instructions for fire-fighting in the event of failure of these measures.
Additional information on PPE (due to moistening, it is wet inside the column and it rains water contaminated with dirt and cleaning agents).

The implementation of the above measures, irrespective of the effectiveness of the additionally planned chemical treatment of iron sulfide, prevents spontaneous ignition and, in the event that ignition does take place, enables effective firefighting and thus ensures the protection of staff.
Measures to improve plant safety:

Ensure an appropriate risk assessment with the mapping of the appropriate mitigation measures.
Risk analysis documents are available throughout the refinery via a common database.
In order to address risks from pyrophoric substances, the safety measures under the Guideline for safety-critical organisational measures are to be identified and implemented without fail.
To further ensure that the procedures arising from the management system are properly implemented, there is a quality control through which the quality of risk analysis is verified by means of an audit programme. The auditors come from another part of the refinery.
In addition, a guide for chemical decontamination will be developed, which will also be discussed and communicated across companies in the refinery sector. One of the aims is to develop a checklist with appropriate measures to check the quality of decontamination.
A further aim is to increase the operator’s and industry’s knowledge of the basis and effect of this process, so that the competence of a service provider in relation to the whole process can be thoroughly assessed.
At the highest levels of the organisation, more emphasis is needed on cross-disciplinary thinking as part of the safety culture (‘away from narrow, silo-based thinking’) so that workflows can be understood and planned across the board.
Other organisational measures relate to deepening awareness of risk analysis among key staff, in particular the importance of prerequisites for mitigation measures (such as the fixing of important manholes) as well as better training on the rules for entering restricted spaces.


The extinguishing plan for fires inside the column has been adapted.
Improvements to damage limitation measures (secondary fire safety).

A technician had tested a dryer on a number of occasions. He closed the man-hole cover, put the dryer under vacuum and started rotation. A few minutes later, an explosion occurred. No one was injured. Investigations revealed that after the last testing the dryer man-hole cover was not fully fastened. Air must have entered the rotating dryer at the man-hole cover gasket after sampling. The ignition source was probably by an electrostatic discharge. No nitrogen inerting was used.
","CAUSES:
The investigations revealed that, after the last testing, the dryer man-hole cover was not fully fastened. Air must have entered the rotating dryer at the man-hole cover gasket after sampling. It was known that the powders being dried could explode, some residual acetone vapours were present and the Teflon coating on the internal lining of the dryer could have built up a charge. Thus an electrostatic discharge may have caused the explosion. Nitrogen inerting was not used (and due to a lack in safety culture (code 5302) and insufficient operational procedures (code 5303), an explosive mixture formed).

The intention was to fill the sample container with approx. 30 t of PS beads (polystyrene) to prepare the next batch. During the cooling of the batch, the filling was started. The automatic start of the process showed weather-related functional uncertainties (frost), so that after switching to manual mode the units were started in the same way as the automatic function in the following order: - Start blower - Open slide after rotary valve - Start rotary valve - Open slide between rotary valve and silo. The filling path was preset automatically. There were malfunctions of the slide between the rotary valve and the silo. After multiple activations, the slider opened. It began the filling process. After about 40 kg of delivery (about 1 min), an explosion took place. After the explosion, the staff working on the roof noticed violent movements of the roof. Then the roof was left.

The automatic safety system triggered safety actions in order to make the installations safe: emergency stop to unloading, starting up of the fire pump, pressurisation of the substation and control tower, off-loading at the building and laboratory.&nbsp; The operators closed a purge valve. At 5.20 a.m. the purge valve was opened to degas the unloading line. The area of the incident was marked out.
&nbsp;","Primary causeThe day before the incident, a worker forgot to close a purge valve on an LNG recovery circuit. As a result, gas was injected into the unloading line until the gas detectors detected the leak. The surveillance patrols and temperature sensors did not spot the leak.
Root causesAn in-depth analysis of the event showed the following:

the different shifts had different practices for locking gas purgers to loading bridges;
the locking method and its tracing were described only partially;
the workers lacked a clear and comprehensive picture of the operations carried out and the condition of the circuits of the gas purger;
the route and purpose of the surveillance patrols were not described clearly and were open to interpretation.
","The concrete slab of the intermediate platform was covered with frost (expansion of the released gas) over an area of 20&nbsp;m&sup2;. It is estimated that 26,000m3 of LNG was released into the atmosphere (about 17 t at atmospheric pressure). The emission also generated a cloud of natural gas that drifted towards the terminal.
&nbsp;","Gas detectors sounded an alarm. The automatic safety system triggered safety actions in order to make the installations safe: emergency stop to unloading, starting up of the fire pump, pressurisation of the substation and control tower, off-loading at the building and laboratory.&nbsp; The operators closed a purge valve. At 5.20 a.m. the purge valve was opened to degas the unloading line. The area of the incident was marked out.
&nbsp;","Following the numerous incidents recorded on the site since 2016, the operator was reminded&nbsp; to allocate appropriate resources to the safety management system (SMS) of the establishment. In addition to the ordinary checks carried out at the establishment, it is subject to inspections targeting classified installations.The inspection service of the site drew up a report on the steel supports of the piping affected by the frost. The inspection service noted that if there are no brittle fractures, the characteristics of the steel return to normal at ambient temperature.&nbsp;The concrete slab, which was also affected by the cold, was examined by a specialist company.

The accident occurred in the 'offsites' area, i.e. away from the main production area. The site was undergoing a&nbsp;planned maintenance shut down at the time, including work on the effluent separators. Waste&nbsp;mixed hydrocarbon slops were being transferred between two storage tanks.&nbsp;During this transfer operation the oil passed through an open valve into a little used 8""&nbsp;pipeline, which was undergoing preparation for a future product transfer from an adjacent separator as part of the shutdown activity. At some point the pipeline failed allowing loss of containment of the oil of&nbsp;approximately 450m3 in volume.&nbsp;The leak was discovered when&nbsp;an operator found oil in Separator 1 which was out of service for maintenance. Residual effluent in separator 1 was being over pumped to Separator 2 for the duration of the maintenance. This activity eventually&nbsp;resulted in oil being pumped to Separator 2 which became overwhelmed and resulted in a visible oily sheen at Outfall 2 which discharges into Southampton Water&nbsp;tidal estuary. No gross contamination or sheen was seen in Southampton Water. Had Separator 1 been in service, it is likely the bays would have been overwhelmed and the oil released into Southampton Water via Outfall 1. The transfer operation started 6 hours prior to the leak being detected, the leak was through a hole of approx. 3.5"" diameter. 
&nbsp;","Pipework had been in service for more than 20 years. No inspection had been carried out on the pipe. There were no records of maintenance activity, although some had been carried out as there were a number of clamps in position at various locations. The leak occured through a hole about 80mm by 50mm. There was gross external corrosion, caused by external coating break down, initally corrosion under insulation&nbsp;and laterlly atmospheric corrosion. There is evidence of microbial induced corrosion.","Consequences confined to immediate area of leak, adjacent separators and to a limited extent at outfall. No detectable impact on human health, but with potential from Benzene exposure to operators and emergency responders. Environmental impact limited to surface area with no significant ground penetration.","Immediate response by on site emergency response team, area was cleared of personel, and process feeding the leak stopped.
Lost material was contained within the adjacent separators, allowing recovery of this material directly to vacuum tankers.

The rapid rise in temperature suggests that the container was not filled. It appears that what was measured was the radiant heat of a burning plastic container (usually it takes the bath around eight hours to warm up from room temperature up to 60&nbsp;°C).However, the control logs show that the accelerator bath was filled.
It is unknown why the bath was incorrectly indicated as full. A failure of the redundant level measurement is unlikely.
Assumptions made by the experts indicate damage to the level probe support during standstill, which could subsequently have led to the level probes being incorrectly positioned (torn off and lying in the tub).
At around 06:50, an employee noticed a high flame and smoke in the pre-treatment area. No deflagration or explosion was seen. According to the control centre’s incident log, the fire brigade was alerted at 06:54.
Safety measures:The temperature-related shutdown appears to have taken place too late (the cause of the fire still needs to be determined by experts). Fire protection devices were triggered and fire-fighting water retention barriers were set. The building was immediately evacuated.","The expert concluded in his report that, on the basis of the available evidence taken as a whole and the connecting factors, it must be assumed that the electroplating machine was unintentionally switched on via the keyboard shortcut F5.
Once the machine had been switched on, all the basin heaters were activated. The basin heating system in basin 128 was also activated, even though the rapid increase in temperature indicates that no liquid medium could have been be present in that basin.
Other basins with heating systems that were also empty of liquid medium were detected and shut down via the safety line, but basin 128 was not.
It must therefore be assumed that the level sensors were not at their installed position, so that the system was notified that the liquid medium in basin 128 had a normal filling level, which led the system to switch the heating rods in that basin on.
It is thought that the heating systems then probably heated and ignited materials located on the basin floor.","Fire damage, &euro; 10,000,000","Retention of fire-fighting water and leaked substances in the containment area of the small-scale wastewater treatment plant (SWTP).

274,228,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Ruptured cistern caused by weakened ground lead to spill of sulphuric acid followed by the dispersion of a hydrochloric acid cloud,2005-02-04 04:36:00,2005-02-07 01:20:00,"This accident is being reported under the provisions of part II of appendix VI on ""specific technical interest"".A cistern containing 16,300 tons of 96 % sulphuric acid was ruptured. The entire contents of the cistern was spilled out into the tank bund and then out into Kemira Kemi AB's (KKAB) dock. When the sulphuric acid came into contact with the water there was an exothermic reaction, which produced a vapour cloud that drifted northwards along the coastline with the wind. After the spill there was approximately 2,000 tons of contaminated sulphuric acid by water in the bund. About 100,000 sq.m. of the ground surrounding the spill has been affected by the acid. An acid cloud was produced when the sulphuric acid came into contact with the salt water in the bund. The salt water consisted of approx. 0.7 w-% chloride ions. The Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) has estimated that the sulphuric acid together with the salt water produced a cloud (gas and aerosol) consisting of hydrogen chloride (HCl). During the first few minutes the maximum concentration of HCl was estimated at 6 000 mg/m3 at some spots near the scene of the accident.&nbsp; After 10 min the highest concentration was 600 mg/m3 and the concentration declined to 60 mg/m3 after 60 min. Fortunately the cloud moved along the coast line and mostly over the sea. No one outside the plant was affected.The cistern stands in a tank farm and the bund can hold a third of a cistern's volume in the event of a leak. The bund was filled with salt water when the rupture occurred. There was also another cistern containing 19,500 tons of 96 % sulphuric acid in the bund. To reduce the risk of damage to this other cistern the incident commander ordered the emptying of the bund, resulting in 1,000 to 2,000 tons of water contaminated by sulphuric acid being pumped out into the company's dock area.Meteorological conditions:The acid cloud (gas and aerosol)&nbsp; moved along the coastline but mostly over the sea. After approx. one hour and approx. 10 km away from the plant the acid concentration in the cloud was harmless. Precipitation: none, Temp: 5C, Wind Speed: 2.4, Direction: Southeast 140degrees","The cause of this incident has been assessed to be a leak in a coolant supply pipe, which caused a weakening of the ground under the tank farm. This led to instability in the cistern, which subsequently split. The dyking was also damaged. Progress of events 4.2.2005:03.35 hours:&nbsp; the alarm raised about low pressure in the coolant supply pipe, which instigated the starting up of another coolant supply pump in order to maintain supply to the works. 03.45: water seen in the dyking coming from a hole east of the cistern inside the dyking.04.10: the water starts to run out over the dyking.04.36: The cistern split and 16, 300 tons of sulphuric acid emptied from the cistern in effect instantaneously.&nbsp; A high acid wave was seen moving towards the dock. Personnel in the docks area, 8 people (5 KKAB employees and 3 from Helsingborg's port), ran in different directions to reach safety. 5104 - corrosion/fatigueThe primary cause of the incident was the leak in the coolant supply pipe. The pipe is made of concrete and came into use during the first half of the 1960s, most likely 1963. The pipe had been in use through the years without any major problems ever having been identified. The only damage noted to the pipe was a leak at the pumping station in 1999.An inspection of the failed pipe after the incident detected little or no internal corrosion, but heavy external corrosion to the concrete. In certain places on the pipe the concrete has corroded so severely that the reinforcing steel has been exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appearance of that part of the coolant supply pipe that was studied suggests that the corrosion is as a result of an acidic attack on the concrete.&nbsp; According to a German DIN standard (1991) DIN 4030 and a European standard EN 260 (2001) a strong attack on concrete occurs if the pH level in surrounding water is&nbsp; &lt; 5.5 and a very strong attack is if the pH level is &lt;4.5.In 1989 a ground pollution study was carried out in the area, during which one of the sample taking points was close to the failed coolant supply pipe. At this point the pH level was measured at approx. 4 in the shallow groundwater. With this new knowledge gained the company drew the conclusion that this pH level entailed risks for strong acidic attacks on the concrete. The same conditions apply to the risk of a sulphate attack in the pipe. ","Consequences for humansSulphuric acid&nbsp; and hydrochloric acid are extremely corrosive and can in mist form cause severe irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin. Eight persons who worked at the plant were taken to hospital for check ups, but were able to go home later that day, after they'd been examined.Because of the way the acid cloud moved no one off-site was affected by the acid cloud.&nbsp;On the morning of 4th February 2005 at 06.00 the public in the whole of Helsingborg Town was warned by a message broadcast on the radio. This message informed the public that fuming sulphuric acid (oleum) from a dock cistern in Kemiras Kopparverk dock had come into contact with water and converted to gas, which in the south-westerly wind threatened all of Helsingborg's urban area. Later during the morning information was adjusted and stated that it was 96% sulphuric acid. The situation was assessed as extremely serious and the public were warned and advised to stay indoors and close all windows and doors. The public were also advised to listen to local radio on 103.2 Hz for continuous information on this serious situation.During the rest of the morning the cordoned off exclusion zone was reduced so as to cover an area of about 1 square kilometre. This area houses approximately 7,000 inhabitants and the civil protection measures being taken greatly reduced their freedom of movement. The exclusion zone was further reduced later during the day, but still affected some 4,500 inhabitants. On Sunday (6th February) at 1700 hours the Incident Commander in Helsingborg ordered a further reduction of the exclusion zone so that it now only covered the grounds of the affected company, KKAB, surrounding the incident site. Consequences for the environmentAn area of about 100,000 sq.m. within the company's industrial area (dock area) was covered, for various durations, by the released sulphuric acid.Sulphuric acid is extremely acidic but moderately toxic for flora and fauna both on land and in water. Each year inspections of flora and fauna and substances toxic to the environment are carried out in the channel around Helsingborg, in accordance with the municipality's coastal inspection programme. At a meeting on 7th February 2005 between the company, the county administrative board and the municipality a pH level of 3.5 was recorded in the company's dock. The decision was then taken that more detailed environmental impact inspections are required and that the company shall present a programme for this to the county administrative board.&nbsp; This decision resulted in KKAB carrying out the following three studies in and outside Kopparverk Harbour.KKAB has in conjunction with a consulting firm carried out a number of pH measurements, in Kopparverk Harbour. During the first week, after the incident very low pH levels were measured in the harbour. After ten days the levels were however close to normal, with the lowest pH level being 6.5. Samples taken about two weeks after the incident from the central and outer parts of the harbour and in adjoining parts of the Öresund channel showed close to normal pH levels. In none of the sample points was the pH level lower than 7.6.The municipal health and environment protection committee in Helsingborg town conducted studies of the marine environment in and outside Kopparverk Harbour on 1st March 2005. Their report states, ""Well arranged studies of watercourse fauna on 1st March 2005, just over three weeks after the sulphuric acid emission in Kopparverk Harbour in Helsingborg, do not suggest any large scale effects. All vegetation was killed in the harbour and in the harbour entrance area while clear effects couldn't be identified 300 metres away. Follow-up studies will be carried out at the end of April, when a larger area will be covered"".Another consulting firm has on commission from KKAB studied the coastal marine environment in and outside Kopparverk Harbour. The results from this report indicate that there has been a strong effect furthest in in the harbour. In the outer parts of the harbour the study shows normal conditions for the area as regards to flora and fauna.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results from the studies show that the sulphuric acid emission into Kopparverk Harbour had a serious affect on local flora in the inner and deepest parts of the harbour and harbour entrance area. The emission has been assessed by the company as not having had any major negative effects on the Öresund channel. Follow ups will be carried out within the framework of Helsingborg' coastal inspection programme.KKAB has in laboratory tests, since the incident, shown that when sulphuric acid is diluted by seawater some of the chlorine is converted to hydrogen chloride gas. Calculations have shown that approximately 11.5 tons of hydrogen chloride gas can have been produced at the time of the incident.&nbsp; As hydrogen chloride gas is enveloped in a cloud of steam the hydrochloric acid was probably absorbed by the water particles and thus hydrochloric acid with a concentration of approx 4% was produced. It has not yet been determined whether or not the airway irritation that some nearby residents experienced was due to the sulphuric acid aerosol or to hydrogen chloride gas.&nbsp; The reaction that occurred between the water and sulphuric acid in the dock is not believed to have led to any gas formation, because the reaction took place under the surface and any gas produced would have been absorbed in the water above it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Community Disruption:A message informed the public that fuming sulphuric acid (oleum) from a dock cistern in Kemiras Kopparverk dock had come into contact with water and converted to gas, which in the south-westerly wind threatened all of Helsingborg's urban area. Later during the morning information was adjusted and stated that it was 96% sulphuric acid.

On Sunday (6th February) at 1700 hours the incident commander in Helsingborg ordered a further reduction of the exclusion zone so that it now only covered the grounds of the affected company, KKAB, surrounding the incident site. Discussion:Perhaps. in retrospect, the cordoned off zone was too large and lasted for too long, which reduced the freedom of movement of many people. Precautions taken were to ensure that no one came to harm.","The fire brigade was alerted at 04.40 hours on 4.2.2005. And at 06.00 the public was warned by a message broadcast on the radio.

Official Action taken - legal action:Preliminary police investigation was removed from the cause list.Official Action taken - other action:
The Swedish Accident Investigation Board has investigated the accident (Report RO 2008:02) and gave the following recommendations to the Swedish Rescue Services Board.1. Work for that the consequences of large amount of sulfuric acid is investigated and, if desirable, propose that the substance should be included in the list of dangerous chemicals in the Seveso Directive.2. Work for the awareness among pertinent companies and organizations of the risks involved with major emissions of sulphuric acid that mix with water containing chloride ions 3. Work for the awareness among municipal fire and rescue servicies and other pertinent authorities of the risks in cases of major emissions of sulphuric acid that mix with water containing chloride ions. 4.Work for the awareness of pertinent companies and organizations of the risk of a domino effect as a result of damages to underground pressurized conduits (pipes or cables) that are in dangerous proximity to tanks containing dangerous substances. 5.Clarify the nomenclature used in warning the general public so that the meaning of the ""Important announcement"" signal and warning information known as ""Important&nbsp; Public Announcement"" can simply and clearly be distinguished from one another in connection with municipal fire and rescue services in cases where misunderstanding otherwise may may occur.6. Work for the immediate use of the ""Important announcement"" signal as well as the ""Important Public Announcement"" warning by municipal fire and rescue services in emergencies. 7. Work for a follow-up the management organisation of&nbsp; the municipal fire and rescue services and their ability to effective&nbsp; handle a major accident. The aim of the follow-up should be to work for a purposive organisation and for the planning of sufficient and appropriate resources. The Swedish Accident Investigation Board gave the following recommendations to the Swedish Work Environment Authority:1. Consider the need to complement ordinances in the Work Environment Authority's statutes regarding pressurized devices in terms of the background of , among other things, the need to assess risks and constantly supervise those facilities corresponding to major water pipes with significant pressure and flow. 2. Work for that equipments for warning for example&nbsp; in-site sirenes have sufficient reliability.","The incident on 4th February 2005 has led to the initiation of a number of activities at KKAB, all of which have as their objective the prevention of a similar incident being repeated. Here is a description of current activities: 1. Immediately after the incident an inspection began of the whole of KKAB's industrial area, to assess if there were other important installations (from a safety perspective) in which a similar incident could occur.&nbsp; With this as a basis, and in conjunction with the following points, the company will decide on the design of future water supply.2. As the other supply pipes for the coolant in the docks area could not be guaranteed to be in a satisfactory condition, especially as sulphuric acid had leaked into the pipes during the incident, the decision was promptly taken to lay new pipes. The new pipes are made of plastic, PEH 100, and lie overground along the shoreline in the docks area.&nbsp; Risk analyses have been carried out and the new pipeline has been put in place. The company has also decided to build another pipeline parallel to the first.&nbsp; The pipes will be covered by macadam.3. At the time of the incident the pressure in the coolant supply pipe fell from about 6 to about 2 bars. The operator's instructions then were to ensure continued coolant supply to the works, which is why another pump was started. Such a powerful drop in pressure probably indicates that something serious has happened with the pipe. Therefore, the new pipes are installed with a low pressure fail-safe, which shuts off the pumps if the pressure falls below a level lower than those expected within normal operating conditions.4. KKAB has started working out what guidelines should apply for ground pipes within the company's area. Choice of material, ground conditions, proximity to installations relying on pressure, dimension and protection measures taken are some of the parameters that will be taken into account. 5. The company has also started an overhaul of routines in order to increase focus on ground pipes. "
275,1003,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Flaring of ethylene from a petrochemical plant,2007-07-09 11:15:00,2007-07-09 11:15:00,"In a petrochemical plant, 60 t of off-specification ethylene was flared from 11.15 am to 5 pm following the securing of the digester of the steam-cracking unit after a lightning strike. The work carried out on one of the plant's boilers prevented removal by steam of the flaring exhaust gas; a cloud of smoke was visible from several kilometres away.The digester used nickel catalysis to convert hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) into methane (CH4) and water (H2O) at a temperature close to 230 °C. The H2 purified in this way from the CO can convert acetylene into ethylene, which is not the case when it is polluted with CO. The ethylene, which meets a relatively strict specification (5 ppm acetylene maximum) is then transformed into polyethylene.At 11.15 am on the day of the accident, a lightning strike made it necessary to secure the digester on high temperature safety; insufficient supply of H2 to hydrogenate the acetylene resulted in a high output of off-specification ethylene that had to be flared given the lack of any storage facility on the site. The unit was back in service at 12 noon, but the time required to restore the system was underestimated, leading to the production of off-specification ethylene and consequently the need to flare it until 5 pm. 2. ","Lightning (natural accident source) and organizational failure.​A lightning strike made it necessary to secure the digester on high temperature safety; the decrease in H2 production, which permits hydrogenation of the acetylene, resulted in a large output of off-specification ethylene that had to be flared given the lack of any storage facility on the site.

At 02:55, there was a leak of phosgene, a toxic gas used as a raw material, within the pressure equipment containment chamber.","The leak occurred at the location of the connecting flange of a relief valve, upstream of the phosgenation reactor. The valve seal had been incorrectly reassembled after cleaning. A nitrogen leak test carried out prior to restart had not revealed any problems. Inspection showed that the graphite strip over 30&nbsp;mm of the circumference of the upstream seal was missing. The seal's external centering ring, caught in the threading of the bolting system, was found to have buckled slightly. This damage was caused by the seal being damaged when being fitted during reassembly. Checking had been inadequate. At the same time, the large door airlock seal had leaked because it was old and in frequent use, in particular in order to bring in equipment and material, as there was no dedicated airlock for these.","Between 200 and 350&nbsp;kg of phosgene was emitted inside the chamber with less than 1&nbsp;kg escaping to the outside, without any effects on staff.

The phosgene dispersed throughout the chamber&nbsp; was sucked into the soda-ash packed tower scrubbers, which neutralised it by that evening.","The valve was changed and qualification-tested again. The main door bolts (20 of the 460 bolts were found to be loose) and the inflatable seals of the 2 related airlocks (dried out or corroded) were replaced. All the openings of the containment chamber were checked.
The operator made improvements to the formal procedure for testing equipment after cleaning: systematic acceptance of the work carried out by subcontractors, systematic helium leak testing of the valve.
The graphite seal technology was changed (from B29 to spiral type). Awareness and other training was organised for subcontractors (identification and tracking of seals). The chamber is to be pressure-tested every time the large door to the chamber is opened.&nbsp; The bolts were replaced with non-deformable bolts."
278,227,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Residual hydrogen explosion in a steelworks caused by welding,2004-05-10 07:40:00,2004-05-10 08:20:00,"The accident happened when a welding electrode was going to be welded on to a broken bolt in a wooden frame to a mould to allow it to be raised in order to fit a lifting eye so that the mould could be lifted out of the hole in the topside of a torpedo car. A torpedo car is a long tube dressed with castings and ceramic bricks and is used to transport liquid pig iron from the blast furnace to the steelworks.The torpedo car had just been reconditioned with new castings and bricks (The torpedo car is normally reconditioned twice a year). During the hardening process, hydrogen gas was emitted inside the closed and tight torpedo car and an explosive mixture was formed inside the torpedo car. When the welding electrode came into contact with the bolt in the wooden frame the hydrogen gas mixture exploded. The welding procedure was not an ordinary job but was needed because the bolt was broken.One person, who was standing on the lid of the casting mould, was thrown into the air and fell down. He died from the injuries he sustained. The person doing the welding was hit in the jaw by the lid. He received treatment at University Hospital Umeå for severe facial injuries. Two other persons, who were placed near the spot of the accident, received minor injuries.","An unintentional explosive atmosphere had been formed in the torpedo car. The hydrogen gas was enclosed because of the construction of the mould and the underlying covering plastics.During the attempt to repair the lifting eye bolt (by welding) the hydrogen gas mixture ignited and exploded.The investigation is still ongoing; the results of which will be detailed in a full report. 
The accident happened because of a lack of information from the supplier to the user. Even if the suppler is formally not obliged to do so, the supplier should have informed the company that hydrogen gas would be formed during the hardening process of the cast compound.&nbsp; The purpose of a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) is to inform about all possible hazardous risks of the product within its field of application.&nbsp; ",Area concerned - Remarks:The accident caused only damages in a limited area in the ceramics and masonry yard. People - Remarks:One person was killed and one sustained severe facial injuries. Two people sustained minor injuries and were able to leave hospital on the following day.Discussion about the consequences:If the company had been conscious of the formation of hydrogen gas during the hardening process there would probably not have been an accident and consequently no damage or injuries or fatalitiesThis tragic accident led to no consequences outside the plant.,"Initial response: personnel on site trained in first-aid. External responses: emergency medical treatment on scene by ambulance personnel and fire &amp; rescue service personnel. Casualties were transported to the hospital for further treatment. The company itself ordered all work in the ceramics and masonry yard to cease. At the time of the accident there were several persons in the neigbourhood.&nbsp; The emergency call was first received by the internal&nbsp; industrial guard office who thereafter called the national emergency center (SOS Alarm). SOS Alarm interpreted&nbsp; the call as an emission of gas and called out the fire service first.First aid was performed by workmates. However, the ambulance was in the neigbourhood and arrived on scene in about 15 minutes. One person died and one person was brought to hospital and operated on for serious facial injuries. Two other persons were sent to hospital due to minor injuries.Other workmates were assembled for a debriefing. Seveso II Duties:At the visit to the company the 24th of September 2004, the company stated that it had a term of contract with the supplier that they should supply the company with all cast compound and that the supplier owns all the casting in the torpedo car and that the company pay for the amount (kg) of pig iron that is transported in the torpedo car.The supplier had not in the safety data sheet informed that hydrogen gas is formed during the hardening process of the cast compound. They had not informed that the cast compound should not be used in enclosed spaces due to the formation of hydrogen gas.The company had internal regulations concerning ""hot works"" like welding. In this case the regulations were not applicable because of a lack of knowledge that hydrogen gas was formed during the hardening process. When there are special conditions the foreman must perform a risk assessment before welding (or other hot works)&nbsp; and after taking necessary measures give permission to act. In this case there was no special condition as welding is generally permitted in the ceramics and masonry yard.Official Action Taken - legal action:On 10th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority immediately prohibited further maintenance work with the torpedo car. The terms to remove the prohibition were that the company should &nbsp;&nbsp; - carry out an investigation on the causes of the accident ,&nbsp;&nbsp; - perform a risk assessment and &nbsp;&nbsp; - remove the risks On 11th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority pronounced under penalty of a fine prohibition for the company to go on with repair work with the torpedo cars unless the following terms were fulfilled:&nbsp; 1. Risk assessment concerning occupational risks with chemical substances.&nbsp; 2. Risk assessment concerning work in a place where there is a risk of an explosive atmosphere.&nbsp; On 18th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority changed the terms of prohibition from the 11th of May. In order to remove the prohibition the new terms were that the torpedo cars should be vented during repair and maintenance work.On 8th June 2004 the company informed the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority about a completed risk assessment. As can be seen from the risk assessment the risk of explosive atmospheres in the working place had been removed. The company also informed that it had exchanged the casting compound for the compound they used earlier and not the compound that was involved in the accident. On 9th June the the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority removed the earlier prohibition.Official Action Taken - other action:The company was reported to be legally prosecuted for the accident but the investigation was removed from the cause list. ","Measures to prevent recurrence:- The closed casting mould is replaced with an open one.- Exchange of cast compound for the compound they used earlier.- The torpedo car will be ventilated during casting cycle.- A risk assessment concerning the casting cycle had been performed - One person has been appointed as full time safety controller at the ceramics and masonry yard.- The company to perform risk assessments of every working aspect and, if necessary, change materials or routines.- Improve the routines of reporting accidents and incidents.Measures to mitigate consequences:see above"
279,1220,Major Accident,"Production, destruction and storage of explosives","Explosion at a plant producing, destroying and storing explosives",2020-12-21 14:15:00,2020-12-21 17:40:00,"At around 2.15 p.m. on 21 December 2020, during a stage in the process for incinerating some materials, explosive material ignited and exploded in the area of room 80 (static furnace and associated equipment). Specifically this occurred in the area under the canopy close to the static furnace, from which the products to be destroyed are fed into the furnace via a modelled sheet metal slide.
At the time, nautical signalling flares and other materials contaminated with explosives were being incinerated in furnace 80.

Fragments of composite propellant
Signalling flares
Blocks and planks of wood contaminated with trinitrotoluene (TNT)

The excess pressure produced by the explosion, which is believed to have occurred around 2 metres from the left-hand side of the furnace, caused the deaths of the three workers present:
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The foreman, an expert in handling explosives;• &nbsp; &nbsp;A worker, an expert in handling explosives and the static furnace;• &nbsp; &nbsp;A worker, an expert in handling explosives.","The accident occurred shortly before the end of a shift, scheduled for 3.00 p.m., during the incineration of explosive materials. To date, the company has not been able to identify sufficiently precisely what might have caused the ignition of the material and the resulting explosion.
Based on the initial analyses carried out, and following the observations made by the inspection panel established by the Regional Technical Committee (CTR) to conduct an extraordinary inspection following the accident, the company decided to take action in relation to the following potential problem areas that it had identified:

procedural arrangements, particularly the operating procedure for moving and incinerating materials;
training for staff members and supervision by those in leadership roles;
the recording and traceability of materials leaving a work area and entering room 80, where the static furnace is located;
introducing CCTV monitoring, including so as to be able to objectively reconstruct the lead-up to accidents and near misses;
more careful management of access to the plant.
","The excess pressure produced by the explosion, which is believed to have occurred around 2&nbsp;metres from the left-hand side of the furnace, caused the deaths of the three workers present:



The foreman, an expert in handling explosives;
A worker, an expert in handling explosives and the static furnace;
A worker, an expert in handling explosives.



More specifically, while the excess pressure caused by the explosion found an easy outlet on the three open sides of the canopy and the light ceiling above it comprising steel girders supporting corrugated polycarbonate sheets as well as galvanised sheets in the vicinity of the access ramp to the furnace, it also knocked over a partition wall built with concrete blocks.","Following the explosion and the noise it made, the Safety Officer (RSPP), who was in room 40 at the time, raised the alarm and the internal emergency plan was triggered. At the same time, the Safety Officer and the internal emergency response teams began checking the situation in the surrounding areas to establish whether there were any secondary fires or injuries.
A report of the accident was received in the control room of the fire brigade headquarters in Chieti at around 2:40 p.m. from the Carabinieri station in Vasto, which reported an explosion at a firework factory in the vicinity, without giving any further details.
In order to obtain more detailed information on the event, staff at the fire brigade control room immediately contacted the firm, learning that the accident had involved three workers who had unfortunately already died as a result of an explosion in room 80 at the plant. As a result, the control room immediately dispatched two crews to the accident site, from the fire stations in Vasto and Ortona respectively. The Local Command Unit and duty officer from the fire brigade headquarters in Chieti were also sent. Later on in the technical relief operation, the fire brigade control room asked for a drone team, and the national fire brigade operations centre in Rome dispatched one from Bari. The control room also asked for a team from the specialised earth-moving unit, and the Abruzzo regional fire brigade directorate dispatched one from L’Aquila.
The next day, at around 10:15 a.m., explosive ordnance disposal experts and fire fighters accessed the affected area to carry out a detailed examination of the site where the explosion occurred, before clearing the area with the remote support of an ambulance from the 118 emergency medical service.
The clearance work started at 10:40 a.m. and was completed at around 2:00 p.m., with aerial video support from the fire brigade drone. During the clearance work aimed at minimising the risk of further explosions, the disposal experts recovered all of the active explosive products still present (flares, nautical smoke signals, etc.) and moved them away from the area beneath the canopy where the explosion occurred.","Further work to raise awareness among those in leadership roles about supervising operations and among workers about carefully performing the tasks assigned to them. More than once, people interviewed stated that the reasons for the foreman being present in the area of the accident were not clear. Equally important, there should be awareness raising among staff so as to ensure that their years of experience do not cause them to perform operations or handle materials in an over-confident manner.Review of the procedures for moving materials, so as to be able to identify in real time all of the materials that move from the work rooms to the incineration room.Review of the operating procedures so as to ensure that the instructions in them are consistent. Examples here are procedure P.80.03 Annex 4 ‘Incineration of THUNDERFLASH pyrotechnics’ and procedure P.40.320 ‘Extraction of gunpowder from THUNDERFLASH ELECTRIC D54’, in which it is not clear whether or not water is compatible with the gunpowder extracted. Given that water is known to react with mixtures containing aluminium powders, the inspection panel believes that the practice of soaking the Thunderflash powder immediately before it is fed into the furnace was adopted without clear assessments and laboratory tests that took account of the characteristics of the product, the operations and the associated risks.Importance of managing the restart of activities following the accident and long-term closure of the plant through a training plan and programme (information-provision, training and drills) that takes account of the workers’ long period of inactivity and the resulting review of the operating procedures, as well as appropriate inspection and maintenance of the equipment that has been out of use for a long time.

They were drained at each shift from an accumulator vessel into a drain vessel, which was often flushed out with hot gasoil or flushing oil. The asphalt and residual oils were drained to the plant's surface drain and then to an interceptor pit; any propane present would evaporate. The accumulator vessel had a capacity of approximately 24 tonnes of propane at 50°C and 21 bar. During the shift preceding the accident, the drain line from the drain vessel was found to be plugged; after an unsuccessful attempt to remedy this, it was closed. Draining of the asphalt and other residual oils from the recirculating system into the drain vessel was started. After two hours later, a large amount of propane escaped from the drain vessel and drifted 20-30 metres in southerly direction towards the centre of the manufacturing unit. An operator noticed a gas cloud and, at the same time, the propane low level alarm sounded in the main control room. The shift controller manually closed the valve between the propane recirculating system and the drain vessel. The on-site emergency services were called but on their arrival the gas cloud was already safely dispersed.The propane release was attributed to the plugging of the drain valve by a solid plug of asphalt and/or ice, not allowing it fully closing after draining. This plug was removed owing to the propane pressure during draining from the recirculation system to the drain vessel.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The drain valve was inadvertently left partially open due to a solid plug of asphalt that was inhibiting its full closure (the valve was supposed to be closed). When propane was drained, the plug was removed (owing to propane pressure in the recirculating system) and 9 tonnes of propane were released to the atmosphere.CAUSES:A solid plug of asphalt and/or ice was trapped in the propane drainage valve preventing its fully closure after the propane had been drained. When propane was subsequently drained, the plug of asphalt was removed and 9 tonnes of propane were released to the atmosphere. The plant has not been designed with a double valve system on the drain line and the operating instructions did not adequately deal with procedures to be followed in the event of a blockage.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:15 people were on the plant and approximately 3500 people on whole site when the accident occurred but no-one was injured.OTHER:No material losses occurred except the escaped propane (its cost has been estimated in about 1,800 dollars).Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The gas cloud was detected by operator at same time as low level alarm for the propane recirculating system sounded in the main control room. The shift controller manually closed the valve between the propane recirculating system and the drain vessel. The on-site emergency services were called but on their arrival the gas cloud was already safely dispersed and no further emergency actions were required.No on-site emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- an additional spring loaded valve has been installed in the drain lines to close automatically when a blockage clears;
2- operating instructions updated to include a requirement that the drain vessel and its drain line should be flushed through with gasoil after each draining operation so as to prevent accumulation of solid asphalt;
3- the drain system redesigned so that asphalt can be drained from the vessel via a closed system, thereby removing the potential risk of a release to the atmosphere."

","Due to the failure of the safety systems, pentane first leaked into the manhole of the pump and then into the inspection manholes of the underground tanks. When the damage was detected, the manholes of the pump and of the underground tanks were already filled with pentane; pentane had already reached the pavement of courtyard and evaporated. Apparently a part of the pentane had penetrated directly into the ground in correspondence with the tanks through fissures between the manholes of the underground tanks and their collars.
According to the information given by the company, about 14.000 litres of n-pentane are missing. It is difficult to estimate how much of it evaporated and how much penetrated in the ground. According to the investigation and to the measurements, it has to be assumed that several thousand litres of pentane penetrated in the ground.

On 1/03/00 a release of Pentane occurred on a feeding pipe of a foam production plant.During normal operation of the installation, a leak occurred in a corrugated hose connecting a pump to the fixed piping.The gas detection system apparently did not respond or, at least, according to the declarations of the employees, no acoustic or optical alarm was perceived. The pump did not switch off automatically even with 40% LEL of pentane gas.Due to the failure of the safety systems, pentane was released without being detected in the pump manhole and, from there, it diffused into the inspection manholes of the underground tanks connected to the pump manhole.When the damage was detected, the pump manhole and the manholes of the underground tanks were already filled with pentane; pentane had already reached the pavement of courtyard and evaporated.

According to the investigation and to the measurements, it has to be assumed that several thousand litres of pentane penetrated into the ground.Accident causeAn excessive load on the corrugated hose or an eventual material defect of the hose may be the probable causes of this accident. The damaged corrugated hose was exactly fitted (exact length) between the transfer pump and the fixed piping. The lifting movement of the pump exposed the corrugated hose to a continuous mechanical strain. The substitution of the corrugated hose was scheduled once a year and the hose concerned had been operating for 8 months.The gas-sensor had not been damaged by the release and it was perfectly functional.",not given,not given,"- The substitution cycles of the corrugated hoses will be redefined with the appointed expert.- The length of corrugated hoses will not be longer an exact fit.- A redundant safety system including a leakage probe (5 cm above the pump manhole bottom) and a gas-sensor (10 cm above the pump manhole bottom) will be installed in the manhole of the pump.- The exact accident cause will be investigated by the appointed expert and the whole installation will be checked&nbsp; by an expert.

At this site steam is injected into the water by a fixed pipe protected by anti vacuum and non return valves, (to protect against siphoning ). Because the holders rise and fall as they are filled and emptied steam is supplied to the injectors through flexible lines. It is thought that one of these lines become trapped bypart of the holders structure ; this in turn misaligned the injector so that instead of being horizontal to and 150mm (max) below the water surface it was near the bottom and at an angle of approximately 30 C. This misalignment caused the non return valve, ( simple flap type) to fail and, for unknown reasons, the anti-vacuum valve also failed subsequently a siphon was initiated in the line downstream. The priming for the siphon is thought to be due to an accumulation of condensate provided from an earlier steam test.","Damage to a steam injector resulted in its being displaced, instead of being horizontal to and 150 mm (max) below the cup water surface it was near the bottom.

Flexible steam lines are being removed for 6 months each year so the system will not be prone to damage in this period. Cup water seal monitoring devices are likely to be installed in the near future. The company will be required  to develop suitable audit and review procedures.Official action taken - other official action: Improvement notices, may be served concerning the installation of suitable cup water seal monitoring devices.","Immediate lessons: (1) Inadequate records
of maintenance for the steam injectors are kept (inadequate maintenance
documentation).
(2) The precautions against syphoning are rudimentary. There is no
automatic monitoring of the water levels in cup seals (no
automatisation).Measures to prevent recurrence: Modification to the steam injectors and the holder's superstructure to prevent the equipment ability to syphon and to stop steam lines fouling leading either to loss of anti-freeze capability and/or misalignment of injection equipment.Mitigate consequences: The installation of cup-scale monitoring to set an alarm if low water level are identified.

INTRODUCTIION

An incident occurred, as from 20/09/2020 on the cryogenic ethane storage tank, resulting in ethane releases to atmosphere from one of the two tank relief valves until 25/09/2020. Total quantity of ethane released is evaluated at approximately 40 t over a period of 5 days.
Liquid ethane is stored in a cryogenic tank (capacity 11 000 m3, operating temperature - 88°C, operating pressure 12 mbarg). Tank pressure is controlled through :

- Boil-Off Gas (BOG) compressor (reciprocating compressor, OEM Burchardt), compressing ethane off gases from vaporization to fuel gas or furnaces,
&nbsp;
- Flare compressor (centrifugal compressor, OEM Sundyne), fall back for BOG compressor to flare,
&nbsp;
- Ultimately 2 relief valves (set pressure 30 mbarg), located at the top of the tank (~30m height).

","BOG compressor :

The investigation with experts indicates as root cause an overpressure of nitrogen in compressor crank case during operation leading to (excessive) oil leakage through oil packings and oil ingress into gas packing vents. Gas packing vent is connected with compressor suction, which explains oil in suction lines.

Flare compressor :

The first failure of the flare compressor on 20/09/2020 (damaged impeller) is due to:

1) a not visible damaged impeller during overspeed testing at the manufacturer, inducing the start of crack forming in the impeller of the flare compressor
2) frequently operating in a certain speed range (rpm) in combination with a high process flow through the compressor inducing internal instability

The second failure on 22/09/2020 (damaged shaft and bearings) is due to:

1) Operating flare compressor with a (too) high process gas flow, caused by a (too) high temperature of the process gas (-14°c instead of -88°c). This high temperature was caused by a standstill of the inlet piping during 5 days, where process gas was heated up from the environment
2) A closed valve at the recirculation (kickback) gas flow back to the suction of the compressor",40 tonnes of ethane was released into the atmosphere.,"On monday 21/09/2020 the duty multi-disciplinary team was put in place. A conservative safety perimeter of 150 m around the tank (no works, no loadings) was put in place based on dispersion calculations (20 m 100% LEL). This safety perimeter remains inside establishment fences. Extra mobile gas detection put in place at ground level. Water curtains put in place around tank. Nitrogen flushing of relief valves outlet in service (reduction of ignition and freezing risks).
&nbsp;
On the night of monday to tuseday 22/09/2020 the internal emergency plan level I an II (highest priority) was activated. The internal emergency crisis cell was mobilised, as well as the external emergency crisis cell. The public road next to the establishment was closed. The external fire department helped with the intervention at the tank top.",The starting procedure for the BOG compressor was not sufficiently clear which lead to errors while starting the compressor that caused the compressor to fail.&nbsp; This procedure has been updated to describe the staps more clearly. The BOG compressor has been modified to be more reliable.
290,1090,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Explosion resulting in fire in a rolling element manufacturing plant,2017-05-15 10:15:00,2017-05-15 14:30:00,"The operator has set up an internal committee of enquiry into the accident. Information gathered to date by the committee of enquiry suggests that the incident took place as follows:At around 08.57 on 15 May 2017, an external firm represented by its owner and two other people arrived at the Eltmann plant. A plant employee took them to the hardening shop.The external firm drove a cargo van directly to the hardening shop building. The mobile filter unit was unloaded directly adjacent to the hardening furnace in the area of the salt quenching bath. Apparently, an empty IBC (1,000 litre) container was delivered at the same time. This was placed next to an existing IBC container containing demineralised water.At 09.42, according to the hardening furnace records, the safety gate to the salt quenching bath was opened, presumably in order to place the lances of the filter unit in the salt quenching bath. The pump attached to the filter unit by the external firm was connected to the compressed air network. The compressed air connection was still in place when the emergency services arrived. An examination of the remains of the filter from the filter unit’s second container, which did not explode, and of unused filters found in the external firm’s van, showed that these were cellulose filters.The first filter run appears to have been successful. However, it is highly probable that following this first run, successful or not, the filter unit was flushed with water. Following the accident, one lance was in the empty IBC container and the other lance was in the container with demineralised water. According to the hardening furnace log, the safety gate to the salt quenching bath was also closed again at 10.06. The accident was reported at around 10.15.This flushing process was the probable cause of the explosion.During this process, in order to flush the (cellulose) filter clean with demineralised water, cold water came into contact with hot salt (hardening salt AS 135), which solidifies at 135 °C. The salt bath itself has a temperature of around 180 °C and it can be assumed that the salt deposited in the filter unit was still hotter than 100 °C.The operator’s committee of enquiry is currently assuming that the injection of demineralised water and its sudden vaporisation upon contact with the hot molten salt led to a rapid increase in pressure, which caused the nitrided cellulose to decompose. The additional pressure that this created caused the filter housing to burst.Safety measures:Immediate deployment of the on-site fire brigade and other local fire brigades and emergency services.",A combination of the following events is currently assumed to be the cause:- Generation of decomposition gases from the chemical reaction of the filter element (cellulose) with the hardening salts;- Increase in pressure in the filter housing arising from the introduction of demineralised water for rinsing;- Further increase in pressure due to the release of oxygen from the thermal decomposition of the molten salt.For details see causes/course of event.,"Consequences:
Damage to the building and soiling. Costs: &euro;150,000
As well as one dead and three injured people, a further five people were temporarily admitted to hospital due to psychological strain. A further 16 people were treated as out-patients.","Immediate evacuation, immediate deployment of the on-site fire brigade and other local fire and rescue services.The material damage in the hall will be repaired in the coming weeks. No damage outside the site.Support to the deployment of the fire brigade.","1) Risk level assessment: External staff are classed in risk categories (according to a traffic-light system).- Visitors on guided tours of the plant: green safety vests.- Outside firms: yellow or red visitor’s passes depending on the risk of the work to be performed on site, to be assessed using technical risk assessments.2) Future procedure for outside firms:- Site rules for outside firms to be handed over- Risk level assessment to be performed- Registration form provided to be completed.3) instructions (as before)- The responsible contact person from the outside firm (usually the foreman) is instructed by the operator before starting work. The instruction must be repeated before each new job.- In the case of firms who permanently work on site, the instruction must be given at least once a year.- Written documentation relating to all instructions is available.The incidents officer carries out spot checks on the implementation of the ongoing measures."

The sparks, generated by a scraper, probably reached the paper rolling machine forming smouldering nests in a base-paper roll which was being processed. The roll was then transferred&nbsp; into the fully automatic operated storage installation, the so-called Jumbo roll storage. The storage installation contained approximately 1800 tons of base-paper rolls for the production of paper towels.Later on smoke was noticed by workers of the processing department; the search in the processing department and the storage installation allowed to identify a smouldering paper roll. After an attempt to carry the roll outside of the storage failed, the workers alerted the fire brigade and activated the CO2 extinguishing system manually (the extinguishing system normally is activated by temperature sensor).","Causes of the accident according to the present knowledge: 
It is assumed that sparks generated by a scraper reached a paper-rolling machine; smouldering nests formed in the base-paper roll under process.","Onsite material damage: - Destruction of the storage installation and of the stored goods; 
Offsite material damage: - pollution
","Safety function: The storage installation practically burnt down completely, in spite of the CO2 extinguishing system with a capacity of 2x120 t CO2 and the intervention of 10 fire brigade teams including the onsite fire brigade, for a total of approximately 170 men.A fire watch had to be maintained until 22.01.04, and the burnt mass had to be constantly sprinkled in order to avoid the forming of new open fires. There was no danger for the workers anymore.The structural safety measures, the distance between the buildings and the massive water spraying by the fire brigades could avoid&nbsp; fire spreading towards the adjoining processing department.Emergency measures: Protective measures:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information of the workers of adjoining departments;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shut down of production;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evacuation of the areas affected;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the workers were regrouped at the emergency gathering points and were sent to the canteen of the company; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire extinguishing operations;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setting up of an of a crisis committee for the operative coordination with the off-site emergency response services;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setting up of a safety cordon around the operational area.After the event:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continuing of the extinguishing operations, constant fire watch;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chemical analysis of the combustion residues and of the ash precipitate;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; photographic documentation of the pollution in neighbouring urban areas;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soil analysis.damage remediation: -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; car wash on company expense.","Measures to prevent recurrence:

294,605,Major Accident,"Waste storage, treatment and disposal",Runaway reaction up to a complete rupture and fragmentation of a reboiler in a solvents recovering plant  from toxic waste,1996-04-19 10:45:00,1996-04-19 10:50:00,"The accident occurred at 10:45 hrs on 19 April 1996. At that time an explosion occurred with practically immediate consequences on materials and persons involved. The help request has been made by a radio mobile team of the ""Carabinieri"" (police) from the barracks ""Camisano"" ; immediately after they heard a strong explosion they arrived on the place. Following the call by the police the firemen of Crema arrived within appr. 15 minutes on place, later also the firemen of Cremona. The personnel of the establishment received first aid. At that time, the personnel consisted of 7 persons, not present were the director general and 2 people from the administrative personnel. The director general declared at the on-spot-investigation that there were no written procedures for the distillation since the process was not considered to be so complicate. This process was of discontinuous load type (batch process). Besides the fixed installations in the factory there were various plastic drums having a volume of 1 m3 each whose content was not verifiable because they had no labels. For these items the director general of the company declared that they were used for intermediate or final storage of the distilled. For the same purpose, a mobile vessel of about 6 m3 capacity was used.","Loss of process control, probably due to a missing precise knowledge of all the substances involved in the process (including impurities), with resulting missing possibility of forecast of possible uncontrollable exothermic reactions.","PERSON-RELATED:At the moment of the accident there were 4 employees: a secretary, the distillation plant chief, a technician of other works, a generic maintenance worker charged to&nbsp; move recipients containing recovered substances and to be treated. The plant's chief received fractures on left elbow and injuries from splinters in the right arm and was sent to hospital for recovery. The other 3, apparently unhurt, were checked in the hospital following their shock state.MATERIAL-RELATED:Various equipment received unrecoverable damages (column, receiving vessels and various accessories), so that the plant is no longer operable. Due to the explosion the roof was demolished, also due to 14 m upwards missile impact of a large part of the reboiler (after crossing two layers of strengthened concrete), composed by a part of the mantle and of the welded bottom (2m diameter, 2.5 m length, 6 mm thickness). A metallic fragment, having the weight of 40 kg, was hurled 10 m away after it had perforated a plate of 0,8 mm of the inlet gate of an adjacent establishment 25 m away from the point of explosion. Glass broke and there was damage to the walls and metallic structures of surrounding buildings up to 100 m. Further, damage to the wooden and metallic structures of a house being 70 m away from the explosion point.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","Close to the establishment (within a radius of about 200 m) there were 2 industrial plants (one of them treating chemical substances), an industrial storage facility for marble works and a one-family house on two floors. The competent authorities ordered evacuation for 24 hours of the establishments and of the private house as a preventive measure because of the uncertainty related to the still dangerous situation following the accident (uncertainties because of missing knowledge of type and number of substances stored in the plant and due to difficult assessment of the possibility of a further evolution of the accident on behalf of the emergency team). The competent authority (Procura della Repubblica di Crema) has put the plant under sequestration and started an official investigation.Official action taken - legal action: The plant is under a status of sequestration by the competent local authority, which imposed an official investigation in order to determine the causes of the accident and the eventual responsibilities.","Immediate lessons: As known on the basis of an on-spot-investigation, the company had not presented the declaration foreseen by the Italian legislation corresponding to the Seveso Directive 82/501/EEC. The reason of the missed submission was in the discrepancy between the amount of the substances present in the establishment and the amount foreseen by the declaration obligation. The consequences of the accident should have been more serious if the splinters had hit places frequented by more persons or if they had reached the tank trucks or other equipments in the nearby establishment which treats chemical products. Considering the fact that the destillation products present in the warehouse were highly flammable, the actual consequences have been less serious than those principally possible. In the light of the above considerations it is useful to study again the problems which could be present in the case of runaway reactions and the limits that are foreseen by the Directive for flammable substances should be studied, particularly in cases in which establishments are not isolated."
295,904,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Fluorinated effluents release to a channel,2009-08-23 22:30:00,2009-08-24 16:00:00,"Between the evening of 23 August and 16:00 on 24 August, 500 m3 of a solution containing 5 kg of uranium, 1121 kg of fluorine and 1332 kg of ammonia were emitted into the Tauran canal and then flowed into the Robine canal 3 km downstream. The substances originated from the hydrofluorination unit of a plant for the conversion of uranium ore concentrates into uranium tetrafluoride (UF4). At about 16:00 on 24 August, the daily analysis of the samples taken by the operator revealed that the thresholds laid down in the authorisation order had been greatly exceeded. 781 kg of fluorine and 962 kg of ammonia emitted on 23 August (with thresholds of 5 and 230 kg/day respectively), followed by 340 kg of fluorine and 370 kg of ammonia on 24 August. The operator immediately shut the facility down.","The accident had several causes. The fluorinated effluents had been stored in a tank. In order to prevent their cooling from leading to crystallisation, circulation was maintained in an external heat exchanger containing a double-walled pipe dating from 1984. The effluents flowing into the interior pipe were heated by the steam injected between the two walls. At about 21:00 on 21 August, corrosion of a pipe inside the exchanger led to the appearance of several holes with a diameter of 1 mm and to the steam coming into contact with the effluents. The mixture was discharged into the condensate collector tank, the outlet valve of which was rapidly closed by the automatic control system, which had detected an excessively high level of conductivity. The contaminated condensates filled the tank to the point of overflowing before flowing into the retention basin. At 17:00 on 23 August, the operator detected the overflow and reopened the valve after misreading the display, believing that he had seen a value of 6 μS/cm (below the maximum threshold of 30 μS/cm), whereas the screen had changed scales, and was displaying 6mS/cm. The effluents flowed into two drainage ditches and then joined the Tauran. In the following 24 hours, the personnel switched off the site's alarms and the ratemeter that had detected radiological activity in the discharge channel leading into the Tauran, without proceeding to dispel doubts regarding the possibility of an accident having taken place. Only the daily analysis of the waters of the canal made it possible to pinpoint the discharge.","According to the health services, the waters of the Tauran and Robine are not used for sensitive purposes (abstraction of drinking water, bathing); this together with the dilution of the effluent in the natural environment rule out the likelihood of any direct health issues for human populations. Since the level of the Robine was low, the Bages lagoon was not impacted.","On 24 August, additional measurements performed by the operator in the Tauran confirmed the fluorine content. The operator informed the prefecture, the Classified Installations Inspectorate, the health services and the municipality on the evening of 24 August and also the press on 25 August. The Inspectorate demanded that the operator perform a complete analysis of the effluent and environmental monitoring, compile a report on the accident and take measures to avoid a recurrence of the situation; 150 samples and 500 analyses of the levels of fluorine, ammonium, nitrate and uranium were taken during 7 days from the Tauran and the Robine canals. The peak of fluorine pollution was 15 mg/l in the Tauran and 0.97 mg/l at 02:00 on 25 August in the Robine (the threshold of potability is 1.5 mg/l). A low level of fish mortality was noted on 25 and 26 August. No change in pollutant content was revealed by the piezometers installed in the proximity of the Tauran. The level of the discharge fell back below the thresholds after 4 days.","Following the accident, the operator put in place a system of preventive monitoring of ageing and has reinforced the inspection of the dimensions of pipe fittings. The display no longer changes scale and gives a specific value in case of saturation. The manual valve on the condensate tank was removed, and an automatic valve was installed for the next tanks, as was an automatic shut-off for the emissions pumps in case of non-compliance. The verification of safety and environmental parameters became systematic each time new personnel take their duty, and accidental emissions are integrated into regular safety exercises. The director of the site presented a report to the Local Committee for Information and Consultation [French acronym: CLIC] on 14 September."

On 24th May 2007 at 1000 hours a tank exploded at the Vest Tank company in Sløvåg in Gulen Municipality.&nbsp; Amongst other, the tank contained sulphur components and petrol products (gasoline) &nbsp;following the desulphurization of oil products.&nbsp; The explosion was violent and&nbsp;the tank was recketed&nbsp;into the rock wall behind. The explosion also led to a several nearby tanks containing oil products catching fire.&nbsp; Vest Tank’s office building and several tankers were totally destroyed in the fire that followed. No persons were seriously injured from the explosion and the ensuing fire.
&nbsp;
Emergency response personnel from Gulen Fire Service participated in the acute phase. In addition, Bergen Fire Service and Hordaland Civil Defence District were called out.
&nbsp;
Following the incident many people living permanently in the near vicinity of the plant have experienced illness and unpleasant conditions consisting of nausea, vomiting and sore throats. Uncertainty surrounding the contents in the tanks resulted in the need for public information.&nbsp; At a later stage, information meetings and public meetings have been held to accommodate this aspect of the incident. Uncertainty still exists amongst the public regarding possible long-term effects from the chemicals involved despite documentation of the contents of the tanks.
&nbsp;
The incident can be divided into two phases; the acute phase and the after phase.&nbsp; The acute phase consisted, amongst other, of fire extinguishing, the establishment of necessary emergency preparedness response at the location in relation to pollution of exterior surroundings, obtaining an overview of the total extent of damages and identifying the cause of the explosion.&nbsp; The after phase is related to complaints of illness, considerable and troublesome odorous smells and other types of unpleasantness experienced by the public.&nbsp; The Company where the accident took place has been and still is under investigation. What is now clear is amongst others that the activities that took place at the plant was not in accordance with the official permissions given to the plant.&nbsp;","For some months prior to the accident, the tank involved and the neighbour tank had been used for treating an oil product (coker gasoline) in order to reduce the sulphur&nbsp;components (such as mercaptanes (thiols))&nbsp;of the coker gasoline. The treatment was done with 30 % solution of NaOH in water. At the time the explosion took place, this activity had stopped, and the company added water and hydrocloric acid to the tank in order to neutralize the solution. This caused a slight exotermic reaction that lead to the formation of mercaptanes and other flammable gases from the coker gasoline residues, and subsequently an explosion when this gas was introduced to an ignition source. The flammable gas was ignited due to self- ignition in an activated carbon canister (self constructed carbon filter installed in order to limit the release of malodorous gases). The company had not installed a flame arrester between the tank and the carbon canister.Further detalis are given in the attached investigation report.&nbsp;","The plants permission for storage of flammable liquids was withdrawn&nbsp;after the accident, and there has not been regular operation at the plant since the accident occured. Financial costs&nbsp;are related to replacement of equipment, tanker trucks, decontamination.No people were injured in the accident itself, but following the incident many people living permanently in the near vicinity of the plant have experienced illness and unpleasant conditions consisting of nausea, vomiting and sore throats. Uncertainty surrounding the contents in the tanks resulted in the need for public information.&nbsp; At a later stage, information meetings and public meetings&nbsp;were held to accommodate this aspect of the incident.

Owing to the ongoing repair work, since the end of 2014 one tank – and therefore around one third of the storage capacity for the interface – has been unavailable.For operational reasons relating to the pipeline, on 3&nbsp;March 2015 the interface was unusually large, so that it was unclear whether the available tank capacity would be sufficient to store the sales product at the expected high standards.
In order to test the options for storage in the finished product tank without an adverse impact on quality, the dispatchers fetched the pipeline quality manager while the filling was still underway. Distracted by the discussion, they heard neither warning signals from the system nor a telephone call from the measuring station at Flörsheim and consequently did not act on them.The overfill alarm (changeover point – tank level measurement) was activated at 14:38:14 and set off acoustic and optical alarms in the pipeline measuring station. Just 36 seconds later, the HHH alarm (independent overfill protection device within the meaning of the VAwS Ordinance on installations handling substances which constitute a hazard to water) was activated, which in turn activated the automatic emergency shutdown of filling by:&nbsp;
– closing the quick-closing valve on the pipeline (~6 seconds);– closing the motor tank valve on the bulk storage tank (~40 seconds);– shutting down the pipeline pumps by remote control.
At the same time, the HH alarm for the tank level measurement was reached and also activated an emergency shutdown by cancelling clearance for filling.The available tank volumes were sufficient to safely prevent the tank from being overfilled. The overfill alarm on the tank cut off the fill signal for the pipeline and thus led to the emergency shutdown of the pipeline pump and the closure of the quick-closing valve on the pipeline. At the same time, the motorised valve on the tank was closed.","– The unexpected change in the volume of the product grade in the pipeline, which required additional manual action from the dispatcher in charge (operational – pipeline);– This in conjunction with a considerably reduced flexibility for action owing to the significantly reduced storage volumes available for the interface as a result of the delayed re-entry into service of the tank (operational);– The inattention of the two dispatchers (in charge and deputy) as a result of them trying to resolve competing requirements (maintaining quality standards versus available storage volumes) under pressure because of the continuous operation of the pipeline (human error).","- Optimisation of instructions for the pipeline dispatchers and debriefing following the incident.&ndash; Review and adaptation of break points in the fluid level measurements, in order to increase the reaction time for manual action",No further measures required – the events described led immediately to a safe situation.,"– Optimisation of instructions for the pipeline dispatchers and debriefing following the incident.– Review and adaptation of break points in the fluid level measurements, in order to increase the reaction time for manual action between the ‘changeover alarm’ and emergency shutdown (bulk storage tank).– Re-entry into service of the bulk storage tank as soon as possible.- Raising the volume of the acoustic alarm (pipeline)."

Safety measures:The blast furnace top closing device is monitored by a redundant electronic monitoring system. The investigation revealed that the signals in the control system for ‘open’ and ‘closed’ do not correspond sufficiently to the fully open and fully closed positions, respectively, of the blast furnace top closing device.","
The blockage of the blast furnace top closing device (bell) itself is suspected to have been caused by a larger object (chunk) in the blast furnace feed.


A systemic error was identified in the closing-device (bell) monitoring system, in that the charging skip was lifted by the blast furnace hoist during normal operation. This step in the process involved automated release by the programmable logic controller (PLC) by means of the closing-device monitoring system (system for monitoring the position of the bell), even though the blast furnace top closing device was not fully closed because of the blockage.

Analysis of the electronic closing-device monitoring system revealed that the ‘bell OPEN’ and ‘bell CLOSED’ limit switches had both been incorrectly programmed in the PLC.The ‘bell OPEN’ limit switch had been programmed in such a way that the blast furnace hoist was given clearance to lift the charging skip as soon as the bell left the ‘bell OPEN’ limit switch. This means that the charging skip could be lifted when the bell was still in the process of closing.This flaw, coupled with the fact that the bell had become blocked, led to the charging skip being lifted when the bell was not completely closed and could not close any more.",No costs were incurred. No deaths/injuries were reported.,"Within the operating area:
During the incident:Emergency tapping and shutdown of the blast furnace; Removal of the blockage in the area of the top closing device (bell).
After the incident:Adjustment of the bell control. In future, the bucket will only be released for lifting via the crane when the “Bell CLOSED” limit switch is fully reached, thus ensuring that the furnace head is completely closed. The interlocking of the release for lifting the bucket as long as both limit switches have not reached “Bell CLOSED” has been upgraded to SIL-1 quality as a PLT safety device.

The workers were exposed to concentrated malodorous gases at 7:26 am when they were changing damaged rupture discs. "," The explosion occurred when air entered the
system through a dried water lock. The explosive air-gas mixture was probably
ignited due to static electricity. Several explosions had occurred in the same
system during 2016. Most of the earlier events had only damaged rupture discs
that were used for overpressure protection, but an explosion on June 29th had
caused more significant material damages. The explosions had led to decisions
about corrective actions but on November 7th some of them had not yet been
fully implemented. The accident investigation identified deficiencies in
both the state of the concentrated malodorous gases collection system and procedures
related to maintenance work. ",One worker was admitted to the hospital. Two workers were under observation for some hours in the hospital. Two workers got first aid at the site.

The first rescue department units arrived&nbsp;at 7:40 am and the first ambulance at 7:49 am. The victim's contaminated clothing caused by primary care personnel exposure during transport. "," In order to prevent similar accidents, the investigation team recommends
the following measures. The recommendations are general,
concerning the entire industry.  Equipment
that have been added to ensure the safety of the process must be placed so that
their visual inspection and maintenance can be performed safely. Safety equipment
and devices should preferably have appropriate indicators or be connected to
the automation system so that their actuation can be detected.The
reasons for the actuation of the safety devices/equipment must be identified.
Running the production against the safety controls must not be accepted as a
normal procedure. The risks
related to the aging of equipment must be assessed. Special attention must be paid
to process safety critical devices and their preventive maintenance, condition
inspections and need for renewal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The operator
must ensure that the workers are aware of the hazards of different tasks and
work areas as well as the related safety and work instructions. The
instructions must include procedures on how to bring the process back into a
safe state after a fault situation. Management must go through the essential
safety instructions with the workers and supervise that instructions are
followed. Adequate
communication between shifts must be ensured. Appropriate shift change and
communication methods must be defined for operator-based maintenance workers.Operator-based
maintenance workers must receive sufficient guidance concerning the work area
and the tasks, including related hazards, before starting the work. Liabilities
and obligations concerning activities performed after fault situations
(including shutdowns and startups) must be clearly defined. Management of change must also include
the assessment of the safety effects of smaller changes. The up-to-dateness of
risk analyses, instructions and P&amp;ID must be checked regularly. The maintenance responsibilities for
installations that are situated across several departments and units must be
clearly defined.Also when handling and storing chemicals that
are formed during the production process, regulations and guidance concerning
the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals must be followed.  Internal
audits and inspections must also take into account the failure mechanisms of process
safety critical systems as well as procedures for corrective actions concerning
fault situations, including the responsibilities and tasks of the operating and
maintenance staff.New in Tukes: A short video ""What was learnt"" in Finnish. We have prepared also a slide show and a bulletin.

305,1246,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Explosion and fire at a coking plant,2020-11-20 16:20:00,2020-11-20 20:00:00,"At 16:15 an explosion occurred followed by a fire in a 370 m³ detarrer in the gas treatment area at a coking plant. The extractors were activated manually. The operator activated the internal emergency plan at 16:25. The staff were evacuated. A security perimeter was established. The fuel supply to the installation was shut off. The heating of the batteries was stopped. At 20:00 the fire was extinguished by inerting with nitrogen. The weakened structure was at risk of collapse. At 20:30 the upstream and downstream valves on the detarrer and H2S scrubber were closed, coke oven gas was restored, nitrogen was injected into the gas collector and the structure was assessed. The operator installed solid joints on flanges to isolate the detarrers and the H2S scrubber.
According to the operator, no hazardous or polluting material was released into the atmosphere apart from the (limited) smoke from the fire. The operator estimates the maximum amount of material that reacted in the explosion of the detarrer at 170 kg TNT equivalent. Crude coke gas from coal distillation was burnt in the bleeders (flares above oven batteries) for almost 5 days, which was the time it took to return to service the gas treatment (the detarrer that was destroyed and the H2S scrubber were isolated from the coke gas treatment system and remained out of service for several months). The estimated volume of coke oven gas sent to the bleeders is 3,776,600 Nm³.
Coke gas was then flared for 90 days until the detarrer was replaced.
In total, the operator estimates that 36,790 t of coke oven gas was released and burned via the bleeders and then the flares. A health impact assessment was carried out and the SO2 emissions were modelled – according to the operator this is the only pollutant from combustion that could affect the public. The operator concludes that neither the daily average limit value for the protection of human health, the information and recommendation threshold nor the alert threshold were exceeded.
Following the incident, the damage to outlet valves and pipes was analysed. The work to rebuild the detarrer lasted several months. The material losses are estimated at EUR 10 million and production losses at EUR 9 million.
A 25 mm hole and a crack had been detected on the steam circuit 8 months before the accident which could not be repaired without stopping the detarrer. As monitoring of the oxygen level at the detarrer outlet did not show any anomalies, the repair was scheduled for the routine shutdown 3 days after the day of the accident.
There are several hypotheses as to the origin of the ignition energy: electrostatic due to friction of the air/gas mixture (also comprising dust) on metal plates, chemical due to the presence of pyrophoric material, or mechanical due to a piece of metal falling inside the detarrer. The external expert assessment concluded that the most likely hypothesis was contact between the coke oven gas and oxygen from the air coming from the leak in the steam network and ignition by electrostatic energy generated by friction between the gases and the metal walls.
An electrostatic detarrer had already exploded at this site in July 2005 and at other sites of the group abroad in November 2017 and in 2019. The explosions always occurred when the detarrer was put back into service by supplying the electric fields but never during washing and draining, when the electric fields are not supplied (no ignition source). There were therefore no lessons learned and the risk had not been identified by the operator.
Following this accident, the operator reviewed the risk analyses and undertook additional measures, including revising the procedure for washing the detarrer by carrying out the washing and draining operations under pressure in order to avoid any air entry.","The electric fields of the detarrer were switched off because it was in the washing and draining phase. There was no obvious source of ignition for the gas.
There are various hypotheses:

Electrostatic energy was created by friction between the unpurified air/gas mixture that still contained dust and the metal plates, creating a source of ignition.
Pyrophoric materials potentially present could have caused the explosion on contact with oxygen.
A piece of metal potentially falling inside the detarrer could have created a spark.

The expert assessments carried out did not reach a clear conclusion as to the source of the ignition.","According to the operator, no hazardous or polluting material was released into the atmosphere apart from the (limited) smoke from the fire. However, crude coke gas from coal distillation was released and burnt for 95 days.

311,555,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Release of Isobutane (iC4) with trace Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) from corroded pipeline on a Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation (HFA) plant,2003-05-29 23:45:00,2003-05-30 01:10:00,Release of Isobutane (iC4) with trace Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) from corroded pipeline on a Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation (HFA) plant. Company has estimated quantity released as 20 tonnes of iC4's and between 60 and 160 Kg of HF. The iC4's were in the vapour phase and are classified as LPG. Release exceeded 5% of qualifying quantity.,"The failure was due to internal corrosion of the pipeline. When subsequently inspected the pipeline was also found to have significant internal scale, which in some places completely blocked the line. It appears that approximately 2 years before the incident the line was subjected to a hydrotest using water. It is now thought that the line contained scale from previous operations and this scale became wet as a result of the hydrotest. The drying procedures rely on any water in the system being driven to low points by the circulation of hydrocarbons, where the water is collected and subsequently drained. However this relies on flow through the plant and linework. Since the failed line was on the discharge of a pressure relief valve (PRV), there would be no flow. It is therefore suspected that the line was still wet when taken back into service.The presence of this water, together with the 0.3% Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) in the Isobutane (iC4) process stream, is thought to have caused the accelerated corrosion and scaling.","There were no deaths, injuries, community upset or environmental damage resulting from this incident. However the consequences could have been serious if the flammable gas cloud which resulted, had ignited.",The incident was dealt with by the company following its own on-site emergency procedures. Although the County fire brigade did attend they were not required. The plant was shut down and depressurised and the Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) transferred to the emergency dump vessel. The release continued for some 84 minutes from the time the gas alarms sounded as the pressure of the plant was reduced. ,"The company was well aware that the water concentration in Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) should not exceed 2% weight to limit the corrosion of carbon steel. On recommissioning after the hydrotest, there would have been a relatively high concentration of water in the HF in the line. There is therefore nothing new to be learned with regard to this particular issue. However the company claim that the way the corrosion developed, eventually causing the failure, was unforeseen and therefore there are implications for the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) strategy it employs. The RBI methodology has been reviewed. The company has also had to review the hydrotest and drying procedures. The failed pipeline has been completely replaced and new arrangements provided for the pipeline to be dried at future shutdowns. The investigation included detailed discussions with the company regarding the level of corrosion and scaling. These will continue together with questions concerning the pressure relief arrangements for the plant.  "
312,820,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Overflow of a twin tanks propylene oxide storage installation caused by manual error during tanker delivery,1987-09-24 15:00:00,1987-09-24 00:00:00,"The manufacturing plant was being supplied from one previously-filled twin tank whilst the parallel twin tank was receiving the last of the tanker delivery. The tank in use had been re-pressurised with nitrogen to 2 barg whilst the tank being filled had been re-pressurised as usual to 0.35-0.7 barg and its vent valve set partly open to vent displaced nitrogen to atmosphere. During the change-over between tanks, the operator omitted to shut off the bottom outlet valve of the tank now receiving so that when he opened up the bottom outlet valve of the twin tank now supplying the plant he established in error a direct open connection between the twin tanks via the 1"" diameter bottom outlet manifold. Owing to the differential tank pressures, propylene oxide from the full tank flowed into the vented tank in addition to current inflow from the delivery tanker. In consequence the vented tank overfilled until propylene oxide overflowed from the elevated vent. Escape did not stop when the tanker driver in attendance shut off the delivery from the tanker since transfer via the open outlet manifold between tanks continued. Escape was only halted when the returning process operator shut off the tank vent and, on realizing his error, the bottom outlet valve. The escape ran down the elevated vent pipework and structure alongside and partly into the bund of the neighbouring ethylene oxide storage tank installation. The operator sensibly opened the ethylene oxide installation water drenches to dilute and wash the spillage to drain and ethylene oxide bund dilution sump. Fortunately there was no fire and the incident was contained.","CAUSES:1- The propylene oxide storage installation was entirely manually controlled so that incorrect setting (or passing) of a valve could result in mis-direction or mis-transfer of bulk material between the tanks. Though tanks overloading was a routine possibility as 18 tonnes road tankers deliveries have to be split between at least two tanks (capacity only 12 or 14 tonnes), no hardware safeguarded against overfilling was foreseen . This has been recently recognised by the Company during assessment for purposes of the CIMAH regulation: the consequent intention was to fit tank high level alarms.2) Staffing and supervision of the plant was inadequate. It had become customary to expect or allow plant operators to keep a check on process plant whilst overseeing tanker deliveries. Any delay on either job meant temporary neglect of the other. In view of the total lack of automatic safeguards continuous operator presence was essential and there should have been a clear rule that there was continuous attendance throughout all propylene oxide delivery and other transfers. This did not happen in practice and the Standard Operating Procedures though fairly detailed were not clear on this point though requiring the plant operator to 'observe the level rise in the receiving tank ... so as not to exceed 80% maximum ...'. Suspension of transfer if the operator has to leave the installation was not laid down.3) Line supervisors were insensitive to the obvious staff shortage on the day of the incident. The out-going supervisor should not have allowed unsupervised delivery to continue during shift change and the oncoming supervisor should likewise have suspended delivery operations or given/arranged adequate support for the lone shift operator. Such decision should not have been left to the operator himself who would feel in danger of criticism for causing delay.",OTHER:No material losses occurred except the escaped propylene oxide.Affected Area: installation,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The operator, when detected the propylene oxide release, closed the bottom outlet valve and opened the water drenches of the ethylene oxide storage tank installation to dilute and wash the spillage to the drain and ethylene oxide bund dilution sump. The works fire brigade and other emergency services were not activated as the accident did not escalate.Emergency measures - Remarks: The propylene oxide escape was halted when the process operator, after he returned to the storage installation, shut-off the tank vent and closed the bottom outlet valve (code 7999). After, he opened the water drenches of the ethylene oxide storage tank installation to dilute and wash away the spillage to the drain and ethylene oxide bund dilution sump (code 7102). Subsequently, he informed the drains/effluent system management of (diluted) release to drain. The works fire brigade and the other emergency services were not called as the accident did not escalate (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, both on-site and off-site (code 7703).","No additional measures internal or external to the establishment were
necessary. Existing on-site fire brigade, control room, communications,
emergency planning &amp; operation etc. considered adequate to cope
with and alleviate the so far as reasonably practicable the possible
worst outcome of this accident. Existing on-site and off-site emergency
plans and also local development plan and consultation arrangements not
significantly affected by the possible worst outcome of this accident.
Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- fitting of high-level alarms and trips to propylene oxide tanks (ethylene oxide tanks were already overflow-protected);
2- modification/interlocking of propylene oxide tank valves to prevent ungoverned propylene oxide transfers between manifold tanks;
3- improvement of staffing, supervision and instruction of plant personnel, including in particular: immediate requirement for continuous presence of an operator during all deliveries and bulk transfers; consideration of staffing particularly if delivery/ transfer is to continue during shift changeovers; revision of existing written Standard Operating Procedures to include the point mentioned above.Measures to mitigate consequences: No additional measures internal or external to the establishment were necessary. Existing on-site fire brigade, control room, communications, emergency planning &amp; operation etc. considered adequate to cope with and alleviate the so far as reasonably practicable the possible worst outcome of this accident. Existing on-site and off-site emergency plans and also local development plan and consultation arrangements not significantly affected by the possible worst outcome of this accident.

After the accident, the repositioning of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide tank vents to reduce fire risk to tanks in the event of overflow from vent (s) was established."

Aromatic fractions of different purity grade are produced by means of a technical separation process. In the continuous tar distillation plant several distillation columns separate the previously mechanically dewatered coal tars into primary fractions. Here the distillative processing of the coal-tar also called raw tar is performed.Presently it is assumed that the failure of a flex-hose in the fluid seal system of a circulation pump caused the ignition of a primary fire followed by a deflagration. This may have caused the leakage of some product piping system component and a secondary fire.The smoke cloud could be seen from far away. In neighbouring residential areas odour nuisances occurred.

The full volume of the vessel was usually reduced from 5600 to 3000 kg. As required by the short distance of the tanks from the service building. For this it was installed a new gas extraction valve with integrated overfilling safety system. The modification works were carried on by two mechanics of a skilled company. An employee of the company helped in the modification works. The container was mostly discharged and should only be emptied of the residue and then cleaned. For this, neither safety devices were used nor the residue gas was flamed. Instead of this the injection and extraction pipes were disflanged, so that the out flowing gas escaped until the gas overpressure exhausted. In order to withdrawn the residue gas still in the tank, this was filled with water, which was pumped in the tank by an electrical dipping-pump from the near available flow.
The motor integrated in the immersion pump was supplied by a current elongation cable which was inserted in a socket of the service structure. 
During throwing in of the immersion pump and with this filling of the vessel with water the back pressure was so strong, that the mechanics (workers) could no more support the tube and the employees of the company solicited the plug of the elongation cable to draw out, in order to shut down the immersion pump. During withdrawal of the plug a sudden explosive fireball occurred, an explosive flame struck high and the gas from the tank burnt. The three present persons suffered large burns, their clothing had in part taken fire. The material damage through the burnt tanks amount at 20,000 DM. No environment damage occurred.","It is possible that during dismantling works, mechanic workers for safety measures had let the liquid gas plant out service.","- 3 persons seriously injured

316,271,Major Accident,"Waste storage, treatment and disposal",Toxic cloud from a fire in a chemical waste deposit,2000-05-12 00:00:00,2000-05-12 00:00:00,"Fire at a chemical waste deposit, with small chemical waste. Fire caused a toxic cloud containing: heavy metals, lead, PCB's and dioxins.Meteorological conditions - Remarks: The wind direction was favourable, i.e. the smoke was blown away from the populated area.Precipitation: none; Wind speed: 6.00; Wind direction: east; Wind stability: C; Temperature: 20.00
","How the fire started is unknown. The most probable cause is chemical heating. The fire fighting installation did not function effectively. After smoke detection, the automatic fire extinguisher was activated. During the filling of the hall with foam, it was discovered that some ventilation hatches were still open. Two of three hatches were kicked shut, but then the increasing amount of foam prevented further action. Consequently the hall was filled with foam and automatically refilled whenever the foam level dropped. Refilling continued from 05.16 until 05.57, then the installation ran out of foam. New supplies arrived too late, around 08.00. At this point the foam level had probably dropped to a level allowing oxygen to come into contact with the smouldering waste. The fire brigade had to wait for the automatic system to extinguish the fire. When it became apparent that this did not happen, they could not enter the hall. They were forced to wait with extinguishing the fire until the walls and/or roof collapsed.","The incident caused material loss. Toxic combustion products were formed.The smoke of the fire covered a large area west of Drachten. At first it was feared that the smoke contained a lot of toxic substances. Therefor the Ministry of Agriculture took precautionary measures. The concentration of toxic materials in the water, soil and grass was measured. Milk from cows in the area was destroyed.People - Remarks:39 employees of ATF were examined to detect possible adverse effects on their health. The overall conclusion of the examination was favourable. Some employees reported irritation of the airway one day after the fire. Social life was influenced to some extent, due to overwork. Biometric tests did not show abnormalities due to exposure to toxic substances. One of the companies involved in the clean-up operation also had its employees examined. No adverse effects on health were registered. Furthermore, monitoring of levels of toxic substances in the area around the site (both air and soil) showed that no one was exposed to significant levels of dioxins during or after the fire.Material Loss - Remarks:The farmers affected by the preventive measures receive a total of 500,000 Euros for compensation of their expenses and losses.Discussion about consequences:Initial testing indicated elevated levels of lead and cadmium up till 4 kilometres from the fire. At a distance of 300 metres the cadmium levels in the grass exceeded about ten times the allowed maximum levels for cattle-fodder. In the week after the fire grass and milk samples were taken again to examine the nature, concentration levels and possible risks of the combustion products that were released during the fire. The results of this investigation may be summarized as follows:|· As a result of the preventive measures taken, no elevated levels of heavy metals, PCB's and dioxins were expected in milk from the area. Measurements on milk samples collected on May 13, 14 and 15 confirmed these assumptions.|· Grass samples taken in the area 1.5 till 30 kilometres from the fire showed no elevated levels of PCB's, dioxin-like substances or heavy metals.|· Elevated levels of dioxin were found only in grass at distances less than 1500 metres from the fire.|· At one of the 49 measure sites, at a distance of 1 kilometre from the fire, elevated levels of vanadium, chrome, arsene, cadmium, mercury and lead were measured in the grass. The allowed maximum level in cattle-fodder was exceeded only for lead on this site. No other samples in the area 0,5 till 30 kilometres from the fire showed excess of the allowed maximum levels for heavy metals in cattle-fodder.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","On-site systems: not known yet. External services: firebrigade was active controlling the fire. Ministry of Agriculture took precautionary measures. The concentration of toxic materials in the water, soil and grass was measured. Milk from cows in the area was destroyed.Emergency measures - Remarks: The Ministry of Health advised against the consumption of products grown in gardens or vegetable gardens within a distance of 1.5 kilometres from the fire. The Ministry of Agriculture ordered restrictive measures for farms in the vicinity (up to a distance of 30 kilometres from the fire). Cattle were put into the stable, grass was not used as cattle-fodder and milk was collected separately. A few days later, tests showed that only grass samples within a distance of 1.5 kilometres from the fire were contaminated. Milk samples were not contaminated. The preventive measures concerning milk were therefore lifted. The preventive measures concerning cattle and grass were lifted except for farms in the 1.5 kilometres zone. For those farms, the preventive measures were only lifted after the grass had been mowed and destroyed. Concerning the on-site clean-up operation: An estimate of 3400 m3 fire-water (mixed with sewage) was transported to a disposal facility. Several areas on the property of ATF De Pijp were contaminated due to firewater run-off and cleaning operations. 691.460 tonnes of contaminated soil were excavated and transported to a disposal facility.Official action taken - legal action: Penal investigationOfficial action taken - other official action: see 1d. Furthermore the permit for operating the installation was partially withdrawn. To resume the company's activities an adapted working procedure has been drawn up. This working procedure is based on daily removal of waste materials. Local authorities also ordered a screening for toxic substances of objects in the vicinity of the site.","Measures&nbsp; to mitigate consequences: The depot was equipped with an automatic hi-ex firefighting system with inside air. After smoke detection the foam fire extinguisher was activated. This has presumably prevented the fire from spreading for several hours, but has not led to complete extinguishing of the fire. The extinguisher installation did not work flawlessly. Part of the foam was lost through open hatches at the bottom of the depot. However, there are no indications that this significantly reduced the effectiveness of the installation. Therefore the effectiveness of the hi-ex foam extinguisher, whether or not equipped with inside air, in extinguishing fires in chemical depots must be questioned. The Committee Prevention of Disasters (CPR), which recommends the use of this particular fire fighting system in its guideline CPR 15, has ordered further investigation into this subject."
317,480,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Explosion of a furnace in a foundry,2000-02-21 15:15:00,2000-02-21 00:00:00,"The accident occurred in a foundry. Six persons were injured by the explosion of the furnace.The establishment is not classified as a Seveso plant, but the accident has certain characteristics (conditions of furnace explosion, effects...) which may be of interest and which may provide information that is relevant to other installations of the same type.","The main factual data relative to the circumstances are as follows :&nbsp;- The level of the metal bath was abnormally high. The furnace-operator had to raise the level of the dam and slightly incline the furnace spout.&nbsp;- Solid products came to the surface of the metal bath when oxygen was being blown in.&nbsp;- The furnace-man noted unmelted parts in the bottom of the furnace (by testing with a metal rod) a few minutes before the accident.&nbsp;- There were no unmelted elements attached to the sides of the furnace.&nbsp;- The average thickness of the arch bricks was measured at 180mm. The new brick is 250mm thick.&nbsp;- A few bricks of the arch's outer row were found on the periphery of the arch's metal ring.&nbsp;- A sample of metal ejected by the furnace door was analysed :.&nbsp;- The examination of the off-gas recorder on the stack outlet highlights the rapid increase of CO content at the time of the accident.&nbsp;- No water leak was reported in the cooling systems and the refractory material of the hearth was in very good condition.&nbsp;- While the load remaining in the furnace was melting after the accident, melting difficulties and rapid temperature increases to 1,700° C followed by abrupt drops to 1,550° C were noted. The temperature rise/drop phenomenon was noted 2 to 3 times. This phenomenon is interpreted by the dissolution of unmelted products in the bottom of the furnace and their rise to the top.Based on testimony by the personnel, reconstruction of the previous casting operation through to just after the accident, and post-accident investigations, some hypotheses relative to the phenomenon observed were presented. After analysis, some of them were finally rejected (Water leak inside the furnace, presence of a hollow body, collapse of the arch, collapse of unmelted elements attached to the side of the furnace, water present in the slag tank).On the other hand, the following causes have been retained :&nbsp;- The nickeled sand in the bottom of the furnace did not melt completely; the intense mixing of the metal by the injection of gaseous oxygen helped the nickeled sand rise to the surface. The nickel oxide was deoxidised by passing through the metal; the oxygen thus released combined with the carbon present in the bath and produced large quantities of CO and CO2 very rapidly. This hypothesis is substantiated by the recording of the gas analysers; a calculation shows that this reaction produces 73 m3 of CO in a few seconds.&nbsp;- The unmelted nickel sand in the bottom of the furnace contained a certain quantity of water and gas, held under pressure by a layer of pasty metal. The blast would have been due to the release of these during the fusion operation was an aggravating factor in the number of people injured. gases; a calculation shows that this phenomenon generates 8 m3 of steam.&nbsp;- The analysis of the causes concludes that the loading method (nickeled sand in the bottom of the furnace) was the origin of the accident.The presence of personnel not necessarily required around the furnace aggravated the consequences of the accident in term of human victims.","6 persons were hospitalised; 2 of them, with severe burns, were taken to a specialised hospital in Lyon, while 3 were able to leave the hospital on the same evening. Another person suffered minor injuries. All of these persons were hit by molten metal or by very hot dust, or were touched by flames.","At the time of the accident, the operators alerted the emergency services and cut the electricity supply and the oxygen feed.An ""urgent"" prefect's decree was promulgated on 28 February 2000, requiring an identification of the causes and consequences as well as the implementation of the preventive measures before any resumption of the operation of furnace No. 2.The inspectorate requires the preparation of an expert's assessment by a specialised organisation which is independent of the company, on the following three topics:- The probable causes of the accident,- An overview of accidents in this sector of industrial activities, and the reasons why the identified causes are considered as likely;- The types of batches or castings which the application for a start-up will refer to. That application will be evaluated on the basis of risks and of the planned compensation measures.The operator presents a report on 24 March 2000. The expert's report is presented on 27 March 2000. The prefect's decree of 7 April 2000 authorises the operator to resume the operation of furnace No. 2 for the fusion of 3 groups of substances, according to the operational modes validated by the expert. The decree prescribes also the preparation of a modelling-study of the phenomena which led to the accident, as well as the updating of an update of the safety report (last version: September 1996).The modelisation study was conducted by the Laboratoire de Thermodynamique et de Physico-Chimie Métallurgique at the Institut National Polytechnique of Grenoble, France. Based on small-scale tests (200g of sand, 1kg of cast iron), the study confirmed the scenario of a sudden release of gas due to the deoxidation of the nickel oxide contained in the sand.","The main lessons to learn from this accident may be summarised as follows:&nbsp;- The unexpected and uncontrolled reaction in the furnace is the origin of the accident.&nbsp;- The presence of people near the furnace at the time of the accident increased the human toll.&nbsp;-&nbsp; Adequate operating procedures are sufficient to prevent the occurrence of this kind of accidents.As a result, the operator had to take measures:&nbsp;- Modification of the area surrounding the furnace: protective panels for observation purposes and certain operations, the creation of circulation zones, regulated access near the furnace,&nbsp;- Revision of all the operating procedures, safety instructions (individual protective equipment ..),&nbsp;- Recruitment of a safety engineer for the site.The accident proved that basic precautions are required around a metallurgical furnace; in this instance, the routine, the poor understanding of the risks by the management and the operators allowed individuals to get into a dangerous situation."

319,421,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion followed by a fire caused by wrong mixing operation in a reactor,1988-06-08 03:00:00,1988-06-08 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
A wrong mixing operation in a reactor in the production area Z9 could caused an explosion followed by a fire. More precisely, the addition of a new product to the silicon oil caused a release of hydrogen, and perhaps also sodium hydride, due to a wrong pH control (this reaction, when was experimentally performed in a laboratory, caused a deflagration). The worker who performed the defective operation was alone in the plant. Seriously burned, he had been found many tens of metres from the point where the explosion occurred; it is unknown however if he was displaced by the explosion or if he was transported there by other people or if he had escaped before the explosion. A call for help was received at 03:07 by the centre of alert transmission of Tours and it was re-trasmitted to the centres of Chateau-Renault and Amboise. At 03:20 a fire fighting vehicle from Chateau-Renault arrived on-site. Since the accident led to the rupture of three fire hydrants, two lances were installed taking water from the Brenne river, 500 metres away. At 03:40 the fire fighting vehicle from Amboise arrived and at 04:06 4 lances were in operation. Meanwhile, the fire covered a surface of about 2,000-3,000 m2. At 05:52 two foam guns arrived from Tours and, when at 06:15, 2 foam tankers arrived on-site, they were put in operation with positive effects due to the synthetic foam used. Owing to the formation of a toxic cloud inside the building, at about 05:00 the Mayor of Chateau-Renault decided to evacuate a building where 200 handicapped people were housed. From 05:00 to 08:30 analyses of the cloud composition have been performed every half an hour. Those analyses revealed the presence of hydrogen cyanide, carbon oxide, nitrogen oxides and halogens. At 08:30 the analysis revealed only some traces of carbon oxide. There was the risk of intoxication for the rescuers (because they had no suitable personnel protection equipment) and also a risk of explosion of nearby reactors and vessels. The water used to cool these vessels and to extinguish the fire (500-600m3/h) caused the pollution of the Brenne river crossing the site. A dike was built a few hours after the fire started to prevent discharge of used fire fighting water to this river. Despite these measures, phenols were found in Loire river fed by the Brenne river. The authorities decided to interrupt (for three days) the distribution of drinking water to 200,000 people. Drinking water needs were estimated to be 45,000m3/day and were covered by various sources (interconnection with water networks of nearby communities, the use of water sources not affected by the pollution, the use of deep wells, extended the use of bottled mineral water and the use of two trains of 3,000 m3 capacity each).","CAUSES:
During the process in which an emulsion of oil and water was prepared with the addition of various oxyethylenic tensioactives, a wrong mixing operation was performed in a reactor of area Z9 causing a release of hydrogen, and perhaps also sodium hydride, due to a wrong pH control (this reaction, when was experimentally performed in a laboratory, caused a deflagration) that resulted in an explosion.

320,134,Near Miss,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of trichlorosilane from a pipeline bridge in a chemical plant,2017-05-05 19:45:00,2017-05-06 01:09:00,"On 5 May 2017 at 19:33:A leak from a pipeline bridge was reported. The fire brigade’s investigation revealed that this was a DN 50 pipeline containing trichlorosilane.The pipeline was decompressed and shut off by the supplier. Due to the length of the pipe bridge and the distances between the shut-off valves, a large residual volume remained in the piping.Loudspeaker announcements were immediately made in parts of the plant instructing people not to leave or enter buildings (gas alarm).Measurements from the measurement bus, which was immediately deployed, showed no elevated values, neither for hydrogen chloride nor for other substances. The fire brigade used turbo extinguishers to precipitate the gas cloud; this was very successful.
However, the gas alarm was maintained as a precaution until the fire brigade had given its final report back on the closed-off pipeline.
Due to the difficulty accessing the site of the leak, due to the presence of a pipe holder directly at the site of the leak and the formation of a solidified silicic acid crust at the exit point, the works fire brigade was able to seal the leak at 23:30 using a sleeve. The pipe was then pressure-flushed with nitrogen and emptied into a blow-down tank.After checking that the sleeve provided a tight seal, at 23:59 the cordon was reduced to the immediate surroundings.
The all-clear was given at 01:09 on 6 May 2017.
Safety measures:The pipeline does not have a special safety system for leakages.For measures taken, see causes/course of event.","The substance leaked out through a breach in the pipe wall.A material check of the section of pipeline in question, the cause was corrosion from outside.The corrosion location was directly under a pipe support and therefore not visible.

During the leak, the measuring station could not ascertain quickly enough exactly which operational unit the pipe bridge in question belonged to. This caused a delay in shutting down the pumps and pressure lines, which allowed the release of trichlorosilane to continue.In order to allow for a faster shut down and flushing of bridge pipelines, an emergency plan (with exact location and layout of the pipe’s valves and facilities for flushing it) for each bridge pipeline with critical content will be drawn up by the relevant operators by March 2018 and included in the operating instructions. In addition, the internal instructions for pipeline bridges will be revised by the end of 2017.In order to ensure that the relevant measuring station can be quickly identified in the event of leaks, the specialist unit for pipe bridges is to affix a colour mark every 50&nbsp;m on pipe bridges in the accessible area and label the pipe bridge supports with the pipeline bridge section number by June 2018.Operators are urged to mark the piping with the telephone number of the measuring station. The accuracy and legibility of these markings should be checked during regular inspections.In order to ensure that the pipe bridge data are up-to-date, they are to be imported into the computer system and maintained.


As the event took place in a place particularly affected by corrosion (salt discharge), the plant was examined for further hot spots.In these areas identified as particularly at risk, the firm’s corrosion protection department will carry out comprehensive external checks of the pipes by June 2018. Any deficiencies found will be corrected accordingly.In order to avoid secondary corrosion, old systems that are no longer in use are to be dismantled. If a pipe is to be maintained for subsequent return to service, it is to be treated as an active pipe and must be maintained and marked accordingly.


The quality of corrosion protection will be improved.For example, the removal of rust during maintenance is no longer to be carried out by hand, but by sandblasting. In addition, a partner company is to give confirmation that repairs in critical areas have been carried out properly.The operating engineers have been asked to ensure that works commissioned comply with the plant standards for corrosion protection.In addition, shift staff carrying out inspections are being made aware of the issue of corrosion.

The Government of Upper Bavaria – Labour Inspectorate has also called for a ‘shortening of inspection intervals for pipelines in “hot spot” areas (i.e. areas identified as particularly at risk).’
The lessons learned highlight the importance of operational monitoring procedures (in particular with regard to corrosion, maintenance, alarm management) and emergency planning procedures."
321,886,Near Miss,"Fuel storage (including heating, retail sale, etc.)",Release of extra light (EL) fuel oil in a tank farm,2010-02-15 05:10:00,2010-02-15 00:00:00,"On 15 February 2010 a release of about 29 tonnes of EL fuel oil occurred in a tank farm during a transfer operation, causing environmental damage. The release took place at the coupling of a pipe bend flanged to a product pipe, to which a DN 80 hose was attached to connect to a mobile pump. The mobile pump was intended to drain an EL fuel oil tank by about 04:45 during the night shift. For this the mobile pump was set up near the tanks on an open space and connected to the tanks by means of flexible hosepipes with the appropriate piping.After the pump was switched on the process was checked by employees and no anomalies or leaks were found. The workers returned to the tank farm control room, from where the operation was monitored on the basis of the oil level (rise in the level in the tank to be filled). 25 minutes after the start of pumping the level indication on the monitor was seen to switch from rise to fall. Alarmed by this, the employees immediately returned to the pump and found that the hosepipe had become detached at the coupling of the pipe bend on the product pipe. EL fuel oil from the filled tank was being released in free flow out of the parted hosepipe and at the same time via the still running pump out of the tank to be emptied. The escape of fuel was stopped by manually closing slide valves on the tanks and pipeline and by switching off the pump.The hose concerned is a standard chemical hose. The coupling is a 'filling pipe' coupling or 'tank wagon' (TW) coupling according to DIN 28450 (EN 14420-6). Such couplings can be regarded as standard, especially in the petroleum industry. They are also called quick connect couplings. The male and female parts are put together and the connection is made in slightly under a single turn. The coupling is then secured or self locked. Safety function:
Slide valves on tanks and piping closed manually and pump switched off.
As much as possible of the fuel oil released in the sump of the pump was pumped back into the tank.
Further action was taken in accordance with the site's general emergency response plan (AGAP) to limit the environmental damage. The environmental damage was caused by a combination of shortcomings and errors:
1.	Due to the infrastructure, some tank farms do not have a stationary system for dealing with residues, which is why it was necessary to use mobile equipment.
2.	A non return valve fitted on the pressure side when the mobile equipment was assembled would have prevented a reflux of product and considerably reduced the extent of the damage. Ultimately, however, product would still have been released due to the still running pump and the open connection.
3.	It has not been possible to determine conclusively why the tank wagon (TW) quick connect couplings became disconnected.

",Soil contamination.,"4 leakproof skips were ordered from an external disposal firm. The skips were delivered at around 08:00. A search team was asked to locate the gas oil released into the ground. It arrived at about 10:10 and immediately checked the groundwater monitoring stations located in this area. An excavator was ordered for the excavation work, or to dig trenches in order to locate the released gas oil and extract it immediately with a vacuum truck provided by the disposal firm.
The excavator arrived at about 10:30 and immediately began excavating the soil and transferring it into the skips provided. The filled skips were covered with weatherproof tarpaulins. Another outside firm made two boreholes with a diameter of 800 mm and a depth of 8 metres in the damage zone. 300 mm diameter pipes were inserted into these boreholes in order to extract the released oil from the subsoil by suction. Oil that had already collected in the borehole was immediately extracted by the vacuum truck on the spot.
","Change the procedure for using mobile pumps.
-	Technical measures: use non return valves and flange connections instead of tank wagon couplings, including for hosepipes.
-	Organisational measures: mobile pumps to be used only on impervious subsoil and/or with permanent monitoring by a 'hosepipe watch' on the spot. The Baden-Württemberg Agency for the Environment, Measurements and Nature Conservation would like to draw attention in particular to the following points and findings:
1.	Hose couplings are detachable connections. They are used in a number of standards in the petroleum industry and the chemical industry for temporary pumping operations and are widespread.
2.	Making a connection requires knowledge of how to operate the coupling system and its particular features. Employees must be given appropriate training for this.
3.	Particularly in the case of use in the open, and therefore including in inclement weather conditions, there may be interference or risk involved in making the connection due to rain, snow, ice, contamination, foreign bodies, etc.
4.	Hoses and couplings must be checked for damage and/or wear and regularly tested.
5.	Visual leakage checks, usually carried out at the start of a pumping operation, give no guarantee that couplings will stay leaktight throughout the process.
6.	If a coupling does fail, considerable quantities of liquid will be released via both cross sections ('male' and 'female' parts) in a short space of time.
7.	Measures which will detect the failure of a hose coupling immediately are to be recommended. One solution is to have permanent monitoring by a 'hosepipe watch'.
8.	For safety reasons, correctly assembled flange connections are technically preferable to hose couplings.
9.	Non return valves can limit the amount of liquid released in the event of failure.
10.	Mobile pumps should be used only on an impervious subsoil.
11.	Wherever possible, rigid piping should be used for transfer pumping operations.
12. Transfer pumping operations must undergo a systematic risk analysis. In the medium term: make and install stationary residue systems for the tank farm.

An area of several tens of square metres around the tanks could be subject of an impact. This area should be free of any sensible installation. The storage in underground tanks reduces the risk considerably.

326,919,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Emission of benzene on a petrochemical site,2010-04-09 21:45:00,2010-04-12 19:20:00,"During a transfer of benzene at a petrochemical plant, the pumps for transferring the benzene from the storage tanks to the rail wagons stalled regularly over the course of the afternoon, requiring the operators to repeatedly purge them before re-priming. At 21:45, a VOC (volatile organic compound) detector triggered an alarm to the central control room, and another hydrocarbon alarm was tripped at the entrance to the complex's final effluent treatment plant 15 min later, followed by other alarms triggered by VOC sensors at the same station. The operator then inspected its premises and noted that benzene was overflowing at the outlet of one of the primary separation pits of the effluent collection network. Two other separation pits connected between themselves and with the above-mentioned, located near the storage areas used in the afternoon, also proved to be filled with benzene.","The operator's investigations revealed that the volume of benzene purged from the pumps would normally have flowed into the collecting pits linked to a covered hydrocarbon-processing installation. However, two days before the accident, this pit's outflow channel, which had previously been emptied, had been shut off and the volume purged that day exceeded the capacity of the pit, which caused it to overflow into the site's effluent separation and treatment network.","The operator's report showed that the volume of effluents emitted into the Merle stream on 10 April was 9 289 m3 over 10 hours, representing an average benzene concentration of 9.3 mg/l, which surpassed the authorised emissions threshold for the processing plant (1.5 mg/l), i.e. 72 kg above the authorised daily benzene threshold.
","At 23:00 the operator of the complex's final effluent treatment plant channelled the effluents, which had been pre-skimmed in the settling tanks, into the overflow basin. The overflow ceased at 23:30.
At 03:45, the operator ordered the pits to be covered with foam in order to limit the evaporation of benzene, because the VOC detectors of the local monitoring network had measured for one hour and 15 min concentrations of benzene exceeding the threshold for informing the local municipalities (0.325 mg/m3 for two consecutive fifteen-minute periods), with spikes exceeding the threshold of 1 mg/m3 being measured at 02:00. However, the foam layer could not be put in place in the processing plant, whose basins have moving skimmers.
On the next morning, the operator started to empty the contaminated pits and spread sand on the connecting channel in order to absorb the benzene, which was then recovered and stored in drums. The hydrocarbon separation pits and the processing plant's storm water basin were also emptied, recovering 50 m3 of contaminated water, containing about 10 tonnes of benzene. The pumping operations ended four days later.
As soon as the warning threshold for atmospheric benzene was surpassed, faxes were sent to the nearby municipalities. The operator issued a press release on the morning of the second day and in the afternoon informed the municipalities that the accident had ended.
","To correct the situation, the operator installed a high level detector in the collector pit and a hydrocarbon sensor in the overflow channel and reviewed its procedures. "

332,872,Major Accident,Chemical installations - other fine chemicals,Hydrochloric acid leak in a chlorosilane plant,2009-05-28 10:10:00,2009-05-28 10:20:00,"It was noticed on 21 May 2009 that a PVC/glass-fibre reinforced
hydrochloric acid pipeline which had been in operation for several years was
starting to leak. To avoid greater damage, this part of the plant was put out
of service and replaced as a precaution with a PVC pipeline which, according to
the specification, was resistant to hydrochloric acid under the ambient
operating conditions (temperature and pressure). On 28 May 2009 the shut-down of the desorption plant was started at
10.00 as planned on account of decreasing loading. There was a leakage at around 10.10 of 32% hydrochloric acid from the
by-pass line of a heat exchanger caused by a leaking pipe. The hydrochloric
acid leaked into the plant's collection basin and was collected there. A
detector in the basin activated the alarm (on-the-spot, at the measuring
station and to on-site firefighters). Staff of the chlorosilane company were on
the spot immediately, the on-site firefighters arrived at 10.13. Once the location of the leak had been identified the feeder pump was
stopped. The leakage stopped immediately. A total of approx. 7 m³ of
hydrochloric acid 32% escaped. As the formation of acid clouds above the hydrochloric acid puddle had
already ceased, the emergency services (on-site firefighters) did not set up a
water screen to contain the clouds. At 10.20 the on-site firefighters left. The hydrochloric clouds formed from the acid drifted eastwards (Rhine)
within several minutes. There was a westerly wind of around 3 m/s at the time
of the incident. It is believed that in the middle of the Rhine the cloud was drawn by
the movement of the water away from the direction of the wind and towards a
power station building site in the Rhine. At around 10.30 the head of operations was informed that construction
workers on the power station building site in the Rhine were complaining of
irritation of the respiratory tract. Six staff received initial assistance from
the medical services on site. Those
injured were then taken to nearby hospitals for observation at around 13.00.
Four of the staff were released by the hospital that evening after out-patient
treatment. Two remained in the clinic overnight for observation.","A hydrochloric acid pipeline made of glass-fibre reinforced PVC which
had been in use for several years was beginning to leak and was therefore
replaced by the plant's maintenance division to prevent a more serious
accident.
However, the replacement pipeline was made of PVC without glass-fibre
reinforcement. When this change was being made to the plant it was simply

333,565,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion after halt for maintenance during loading of gasoline on a ship,1989-07-06 18:35:00,1989-07-08 00:00:00,"A ship was loading gasoline at the pier of a refinery. At 18:10 the ship's responsible mechanic requested a halt in the loading in order to proceed with necessary repairs. 20 minutes after the interruption, a strong explosion occurred in the ship machinery shop, followed by a fire. Immediately the refinery fire alarm was activated and the refinery fire-fighting crew reached the fire area in a couple of minutes. 4 injured members of the ship's crew were carried out to the pier and from there to the nearest hospital. The fire fighting operation started with the local monitors covering with foam the outside part of the ship and the machinery shop. Meanwhile the ship was disconnected from the loading hoses (spouders) and from the tied ropes and, by means of two tags, transferred away from the pier. The fire fighting activities were undertaken by the Navy Guarding Services using special fire fighting tags (water foam). Finally, the burning ship was transferred at about 1.5 km away from the pier installation and six hours later the fire was under control. Meanwhile, the Navy Guarding Services were connected with fire fighting crews from the Special National Fire Fighting Services. However, the next morning the fire, from the machinery shop, reached the first tank and spread, with repeated explosions, to the other tanks of the ship. At noon of the day after, the situation appeared to be out of control. Four firemen were injured. The ship was bent and the fire was extending from leaking gasoline 50 m around. Navigation in the gulf was interrupted and fire fighters tried to the fire from spreading to the other anchored ships. They tried to avoid environmental pollution by using a 400 metres long boom. On Saturday afternoon, about 48 hours after the first explosion, the tanker sank.","CAUSES:
The main cause was a serious leak of gasoline in the ship machinery shop from damaged flange connections. The causes of the damage to flange connections have not been identified. The ignition source that caused the explosion has not been fully identified (probably a switch-off operation in a not explosion-proof electrical panel). When the Original Report was prepared, the National Fire Fighting Service and the Navy Guarding Services were carrying out the investigation.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:About 70 people were involved in the accident: 40 people owning
to the ship's crew and to the pier's crew, 30 people of the emergency
services. 4 members of the ship's crew were injured by the explosion
and were carried out to the hospital. 4 firemen were injured during the
fire fighting operations (from the Original Report is not fully clear
if firemen were hospitalized or not).MATERIAL LOSS:No data are available about the cost of the 700 tonnes of gasoline lost during the accident and of the ship that, 48 hours after the first explosion, sank.ECOLOGICAL HARM:In the Original Report there is no evidence of ecological harms
because, in order to prevent an environmental pollution of the area
caused by the gasoline that was escaping from the burning ship, a 400
metres long boom was put around it.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The accident took place at the refinery pier and only some members of the ship's crew and some refinery operators were at the scene of the accident.Disruption of community life: The access to the Gulf was closed by the Navy Guarding Services.Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The refinery fire fighting crew and the technical personnel were activated and all the fire-trucks were ready for local protection and covering the rest loading ships at the pier. 4 injured members of the ship's crew were carried out to the pier and from there to the nearest hospital. The fire fighting operation started with the local monitors covering with foam the outside part of the ship and the machinery shop. Meanwhile the ship was disconnected from the loading hoses (spouders) and from the tied ropes and, by means of two tags, transferred away from the pier.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The special forces from the National Fire Fighting Services came to support the fire fighting efforts close to the pier and later with tags in the open sea. The ship was disconnected from the loading hoses and moved away from the pier (the fire did not spread to the refinery loading installations) in order to put out the fire without its spreading to the other anchored ships.&nbsp; Navigation in the gulf was interrupted and no other ships were allowed to enter the sea Gulf. The environmental pollution was avoided by using a 400 metres long boom around the burning ship.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- the upgrading of the refinery pier fire fighting systems (including the installation of new automatic remote control monitors on local towers) is ready for application;
2- the crew of ships and especially tankers must be well trained in fire prevention.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, the following measures were established:
After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- the crew of ships and especially tankers must be well trained in fire fighting;
2- the fire fighting means for this type of tankers must be improved and they must be in a sufficient number both on the deck and in the other special areas of the ships;
3- the fire fighting tugs must be equipped with large quantities of a foam compound."

The driver of the truck was killed and an operator received burn injuries because of heated content in the cistern.","The exact causes of the collapsed tank hasen't been found nevertheless that the company has done a lot of investigation regardng the causes. The bitumen layer under the tank was beginning to crumple. The bottom plate of the tank was heavily corroded in the zone where the bottom plate and the mantle of the tank was welded. The corrosion has come from the bottom and the outside of the tank. There were no signs of corrosion inside the tank which was protected with corrossion-resisted layer. The area of the corrosion could have been afftected by heat (Heat Affexted Zon, HAZ) from the original welding between bottom of the tank and the mantle, and thereby received a more vulnerable structur. When the layer of bitumen under the tank was beginning to crumple and there had been room for moist to gather. This, together with the heated content in the tank, could have speed the process of corrosion. &nbsp;","The driver of the truck was killed and an operator at the site got burn injuries on the feet and legs.
The consequences for the environment seems only to be locally limited. The area where the site is situated in an industrial area where there are other depot and tanks and the area is already polluted. The ground is mainly filling areas. In connection with the the site there where a dam for extinguishing water. This dam were connected to the sea, but due to the cold weather there were ice which stopped the emulsion from reaching the sea.
Analysis have been taken and the county administrative board has approved the environmental restoration. Since the area and ground was already polluted and there were no reference values it's difficult to determine exactly how much this accident has affected the area and ground","The emergency service used an explosimeter at an early stage in order to discover combustible gases. A sanitation firm was quickly on the site to start the clearing of the oil from the collapsed tank. To get at an overview of the accidnet they used a drone so that all invovled had the same view of the situation.&nbsp;
It's important that the person that got hurt in the accident got a coarse cleaning-up before transported with the ambulance and also at the hospital so that the hospital's emergency doesn't get contaminated.&nbsp;
It would have helped the emergency service if the environmental experts at the municipalty had planned duty outside office hours.&nbsp;
&nbsp;","The lessons learned can be divided into four main components: communication; practice; environment; and design, construction and control.
Communication
Communication to prevent an accident includes communication between builders of the concrete plate, the tank, the inspectors and the users. The importance for different branches to discuss the building, the controls, the use of the tanks. Those who build the foundation of the tank needs to exchange with those who build the tanks. Those who inspect the tanks need to discuss with the users so that it's clear what the limitations are with different measurements.
Communication when the accident occurs include for instance the importance of involve the communicators in the municipality to spread the information of the accident in different channels, media and also SMS.&nbsp;The emergency service used a drone to get a better view of the accident and it’s also important that every involved has the same view of the situation. It’s also important that the emergency service has established routes of communication with the environmental experts in the municipality, even outside the office hours due to the importance of environmental aspects, both considered to the substances involved but also so that the emergency effort doesn’t worsen the (environmental) consequences.
Practice/exercise
It’s important that all of those who could be involved in an accident practice to better handle a real accident. It includes both the authorities and the Seveso establishment. To practice also lets the involved meet in person which shouldn’t be underestimated. It could make it easier to find and establish contact when an accident occur.
Design, construction and control of the equipment
The dialogue between the designer and builders of the tanks, the constructors of the foundation of the tank and those who control the tanks could be approved to assure that construction of the tank and its resistance to corrosion.
To get better feedback from the controllers of the tanks if there are any possible problem or indication of the tank tanks controlled.
Investigate if the prescribed interval of control of the tanks should change.
Environment
The emergency service had an established contact with a company that started clearing of oil early after the tank collapsed."
335,552,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of para-toluidine from a bulk storage tank whilst a leaking pump was being replaced,2002-07-25 10:00:00,2002-07-25 13:00:00,"30 tonnes of para-Toluidine were released from a bulk storage tank whilst a leaking pump was being replaced. The maintenance technician removed the pump and was collecting a new part from the stores when the line isolation failed. 

The incident is reportable under Schedule 7 Section 1(a) of COMAH because more than 5% of the qualifying quantity for very toxic substances was accidentally released.
","A work request was raised to replace a leaking pump for a bulk storage tank containing para-Toluidine (PT) on Monday 22 July 2002. The steam was turned off and the single automated isolation valve to the pump was closed.On 25 July work began to replace the pump. The line was broken to remove the pump. The maintenance technician then went to collect a new part from the stores leaving the work site unattended. No additional isolation was provided.Whilst the technician was away from the work site molten PT began to flow from the pipe over filling the spill bund and spreading across the site. It appears that the valve had failed or was not closed. In addition, the PT had not solidified as anticipated - it is likely that this was due to the head of available liquid in the storage tank and the high ambient temperature on the day of the incident.There are 2 principle causes for this incident. Firstly, the single automated isolation valve was open at the time of the release although it appears that it had been closed before the work began. At present, the nature of this failure is not clear. The clean up exercise continues and an assessment of the valve will be made when access is available.Secondly, the level of isolation provided was inadequate.&nbsp; The design of the plant means that there is only one automatic valve between the storage tank and the pump. Reliance was placed on the single closed valve and the nature of the product i.e. that its melting point is 44°C.A tank containing 30 tonnes of molten para-toluidine at 55 degrees C
(melting point 44 degrees C) had a faulty pump connected to the bottom
run-off line. A fitter removed the main body of the pump for repair.
For physical isolation of the pump housing, the fitter relied on a
single valve and a frozen plug of para-toluidine behind the valve, as
the steam had been removed from the tracing to this line, to seal the
contents. Shortly after the fitter left, the tank contents were
released due to the failure of this isolation. The para-toluidine
overflowed the bund wall and spread over the tank farm, contaminating a
wide area with a solid layer of toxic material. The site emergency team
tried to stop the tank emptying but failed despite their various
efforts.","This incident had no off-site impact to people or the environment. 

It is estimated that 25 - 30 tonnes of para-Toluidine (PT) were released. The release was not contained by the spill bund so the PT spread across walkways to the east and west of the storage area and into the canal road, were it was contained with sand bags and solidified. 

No individuals were injured during the incident.
Area concerned - remarks:The site emergency team tried to stop the tank emptying but failed despite their various efforts. The para-toluidine overflowed the bund wall and spread over the tank farm, across walkways to the east and west of the storage area, and into the canal road, where it was contained with sand bags. A wide area was contaminated with a solid layer of toxic material. People - remarks:There were no injuries during the incident, but during the clean-up operation, blood tests taken from four employees of the contractors carrying out the removal of the solidified para-touluidine were found to have high levels of met haemoglobin and were taken to hospital. Three of them suffered symptoms of ill-health and two were detained overnight, where they were treated with oxygen before being released. No long-term ill-health effects have been identified.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","The site alarm system gave an audible warning message for the contingency. The onsite emergency team responded to the alarm. The following steps were taken to stem the flow of PT and mitigate the consequences of the release:· Access to the local effluent pit was closed off.· The entrance from the canal roadway was closed off with sand bags to prevent the spread of the PT. · Attempts were made to close the valve from the local control panel but this was unsuccessful.· Attempts were made to cool the flow using water and CO2 extinguishers thereby solidifying the PT but these were unsuccessful· The emergency team planned to fit an 'outlet line pump blank' but this piece of equipment could not be found.· An absorbent sock and wood shims where inserted directly into the flange but again this did not stop the flow. After 2 -3 hours, it appears that the flow slowed of its own accord&nbsp; to a sufficient level to allow the team to remove the air head to the valve and mechanically close it.Emergency measures - Remarks: When the incident occurred, attempts were made to stop the tank emptying and the leak spreading, but these were inadequate and unsuccessful. There were no injuries during the incident, but during the clean-up operation, blood tests taken from four employees of the contractors carrying out the removal of the solidified para-touluidine were found to have high levels of met haemoglobin and were taken to hospital. Three of them suffered symptoms of ill-health and two were detained overnight and treated with oxygen before being released. No long-term ill-health effects have been identified.","Immediate lessons: 
Prevention - standards of isolation on site should be upgraded to
ensure that single valve isolation is not relied upon when carrying out
maintenance work in high hazard areas. 

Mitigation - the emergency equipment (e.g. the 'outlet line pump
blank') should be readily available and appropriately maintained at all
times.
Measures to prevent recurrence: The company was asked to address the following issues identified during the investigation:1. The tank was not kept empty following the discovery of the fault on the pump.2. The tank was kept warm and not allowed to set.3. Impossibility of application of site isolation standards to physical hardware.4. History of pump failure on site.5. Specification of personal protection equipment for fitters was not adequate.6. Risk assessment of isolation was not adequate.7. Isolation procedures were not followed.8. Permit to work was not adequate.9. Freezing of para-toluidine lines was not adequate.10. Isolation of pump under repair was not adequate.11. Emergency measures to stop leakage were not adequate.12. The clean up team used water jetting in the heat of the day.13. The clean up team was not adequately trained to prevent exposure to para-toluidine when removing their personal protective equipment."

Causes identified at present: the halogen lamp used inside the tank was not explosion protected. Temperature measurements were performed on an identical model (external temperature of 279° C and internal temperature of 450° C).

This caused a reservoir to overflow.The overflow could not be completely retained within the building.Safety measure:- The valve malfunction was indicated in the process control system (PCS). An on-the-spot check was carried out.- The valve was closed manually. The sewer gate valve was then closed.- The Heilbronn sewage treatment plant was informed. There was no feedback from the Heilbronn sewage treatment plant with regard to any impact.,"The automatic valve is normally open. When closing, the valve malfunctioned. As a result, the reservoir became overfull. In line with the retention plan, the suspension ran through the floor drains into the underground sewers and on into the wastewater treatment plant (20 m³).As the floor drains could not absorb all the suspension, part of the suspension flowed into the yard via the outer gate.
The following findings should be noted:- The floor drains were not sufficient in terms of their drainage capacity to transport the accumulated quantity of suspension to the wastewater treatment plant.- The layout of the hall floor in the entrance area was not set up to prevent the suspension from escaping into the outside world.- If the provisions of the German Ordinance on installations handling substances which constitute a hazard to water and on specialised industrial premises (VAwS) had been applied consistently and the risks and consequences of overfilling had been systematically assessed, this event could certainly have been prevented.",No effects other than on the release of the substance have occurred.,The sewer gate valves were closed. The contaminated areas within the premises were rinsed with water and pumped out.The rinsing water that accumulated was sent to the on-site wastewater treatment facility.,"The reservoir was fitted with a built-in emergency overflow into the waste water treatment plant. The function of this overflow was tested.In addition, a traversable liquid barrier is being installed on the ground floor in the area of the floor drain.The technical possibilities for automated closure of the sewer gate valves are being examined."

In the cap loading line room detonators are filled, and pressed, with explosives and delay composition.
One operator was in the cap loading line room when the explosion occurred and the operator suffered fatal injuries. The accident took place at the time of a shift change, but there were no witnesses to the accident. There were no damages outside the cap loading line room.","Orica gathered a team of senior executives and technical specialists from other departments in Orica’s international organization. The accident investigation followed the Incident Cause and Analysis Method (ICAM).
Based on evidence collected to date, it is believed from the company’s investigation that the most probable sequence of events was:

Initiation: a friction event was caused by rotation of a bolt on PETN hopper flange using a steel spanner. This action is likely to have resulted in initiation of residual PETN.
Propagation: the initiation propagated from the bolt area inwards towards the PETN hopper.
Mass Explosion: PETN hopper had not been emptied of inventory prior to maintenance. It is estimated that mass of PETN in hopper was approximately between 250 and 750 grams. Propagation resulted in mass detonation of PETN in hopper.

At the time of the explosion the process and the filling station wasn't in progress. The logs doesn't indicate that there were any problems with the filling station.","One operator was in the cap loading line room when it exploded. The operator suffered fatal injuries.
The room where the accident happened was wrecked, but the other rooms in the building were intact.","The other operators in the building evacuated and called SOS. The emergency service was first on the scene of the accident at 0545. They entered the cap loading line room where they found the deceased.
All work at the plant stopped after the accident. The building and the cap loading line room was shut down in order to secure the work environment and the forthcoming accident investigation. The police then took control over the building to investigate the accident according to the Penal Code and the Work Environment Act.
Orica's local crisis management team was mobilized immediately. Their task is to facilitate cooperation between the authorities and to support the staff and the society under such circumstances.","Orica has focused the measures to make the handling of the explosives safer, improve the instructions and increase the staffs’ awareness of the importance to follow instructions and the possible consequences. &nbsp;
Friction, Impact, Static, and Heat (FISH) events with sufficient energy to cause detonation need to be identified and eliminated. Note that energy from FISH events required to initiate primary and secondary explosives is significantly lower than that for Packaged Explosives products and intermediates.
Energetic Material: All equipment that contains/has contained energetic material must be removed and cleansed of all energetic material prior to undertaking:

any maintenance work on process equipment at all Initiating Systems (IS) plants; and
hot work on equipment at any plant.

This has for instance involved improvements such as:

Changed metal parts on the equipment to plastic to avoid metal to metal.
No tools are required to open, change or adjust the dosage of the explosives. It can be done with pinches.

Independent verification and sign-off is required prior to commencing the work described above.
Permits: Any work required on Initiating Systems equipment (whether by maintenance or operations) that contains/has contained energetic material, if that work could result in any FISH event (e.g. use of metal tools, any heat source), must be treated as 'hot work' and must be authorised through the site’s Hot Work Permit process."

work and the reactor had been left in stand-by position for a day.
Suddenly the temperature and the pressure of the reactor started to
rise inexplicably. A few operators on shift tried to find out the
reason for this, but they hardly had any time to do so when the
pressure had risen above normal level.","A runaway reaction is suspected as the cause of the explosion. The root cause of the accident is still under investigation.At the time of the accident the plant and the reactor were stopped due
to maintenance work and the reactor had been left in a stand-by
condition for a day. Earlier in the afternoon attempts had been made to
clear a clogged pipeline leading from the reactor, but without success.
It was planned to continue the maintenance work the next day. During
the evening shift the temperature and pressure of the reactor started
to rise inexplicably. A few operators on the shift tried to evaluate
the reason for this phenomenon, but the pressure rose above normal
values very quickly. One operator went to check out the status of the
reactor and immediately after that the reactor exploded and a huge fire
resulted.The investigation following the accident showed that an unexpected chemical reaction in the production process was the cause of the explosion. It was discovered that the increase of temperature in the reactor to over 300 degrees Celsius led to a break down of the process intermediate, sodium methoxy borohydride, and this led to gases being formed to such an extent that their pressure broke the reactor. Flammable gases and liquids were released in the explosion and set the reactor building on fire. The rise of temperature of the chemical liquid in the reactor was caused&nbsp; by a deposit in the reactor base as well as heat formed by mechanical friction of the reactor stirred. The rise in temperature in the reactor was not discovered in the control room, because the measurement device was covered by an insulating deposit layer. Process reactions were not well enough known and the system was not designed to cope with an exothermic reaction. Also, the safety and control equipment for the system were inadequate. Information from any similar accident experience concerning this exceptional chemical reaction was not available.","After pressure in the reactor had risen above normal level one operator went to check out the status of the reactor. Immediately after that the reactor exploded and a huge fire followed. This operator died in the accident. Due to explosion the vent panels of the building were blown off, the reactor and several pumps, pipelines and other process equipment were destroyed. Costs unknown however several million euro.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",The fire was extinguished by three fire brigades from municipalities nearby.Official action taken - legal action: None based on the Seveso legislation.Official action taken - other official action: The operation license was cancelled and the plant has to apply for a new license.,Measures to prevent recurrence: When a new process is designed the recurrence of similar chemical reactions has to be taken into account by studying the process with as reliable methods as possible. Also the system must be equipped with appropriate pressure relief devices and a reactor emptying system as well as adequate process control methods.

When the rescue operation got underway, it was assumed that the container could go on fire or explode. The situation was hazardous because the container was stacked together with about 200 other waste containers (about 100 tonnes waste) at a distance of approximately five metres from an explosives warehouse (about 40 tonnes of explosive substances). At that precise moment, the major risk was seen to be an explosion, whose pressure effects could extend to a radius of about 1300 metres from the warehouse.","The sensitized bulk-emulsion explosive and rock material, containing pyrite, reacted together in a steamed waste container which was situated next to the explosives warehouse. The container was originally from the Pyhäsalmi mine, where exactly one year earlier an attempt to load the blast holes in the roof of the tunnel with emulsion explosives by means of a new mobile explosive manufacturing unit (MEMU) failed. As a result of this, a significant amount of sensitized emulsion dropped onto the floor of the tunnel. The miners did not realize that the mixture of sensitized emulsion explosive and rock material was a non-conformity waste. Accordingly, the waste was handled as typical emulsion waste and was sent to Vihtavuori. The production volumes of bulk-emulsion explosives in Oy Forcit Ab have multiplied over the past few years because of increasing mining and infrastructure development. At the same time, bulk-emulsion explosives are being increasingly used instead of traditional explosives. Oy Forcit Ab has not been able to keep pace with the disposal of the emulsion waste. The emulsion waste occurs during both the production phase and the application phase. Emulsion waste containers have been stored mainly in the yard of the explosives factory and in the yard of the explosives warehouse. Tukes has requested that Forcit takes corrective actions to resolve the waste-container warehousing problem. Forcit has taken several corrective actions, but these actions have been inadequate due to the simultaneous increase in production volumes. The Explosives Act that is currently in force covers the production, use and disposal of traditional explosives. The special properties and risks connected with the production, use and disposal of emulsion explosives have not adequately been taken into account in these legal requirements. ","Major accident didn't occur. Major risk was seen to be an explosion, whose pressure effects could extend to a radius of about 1300 metres from the warehouse. Evacuation of the surrounding area, about 2000 inhibitants.Shut down of production unit for two weeks.","The implementation of rescue operation was complicated due to the following facts: - The operator didn't have the permit from authority for waste containers (permit was only for explosives warehouse)- Waste containers weren't taken into account in the risk analysis or emergency plans. Thus the accident scenarios were needed to recalculate in the event. The rescue services decided to evacuate all the inhabitants in the area before they attempted to move the container and cool down the interior. To safeguard all the inhabitants, the evacuation was extended to cover the whole Vihtavuori village, which has about 2000 inhabitants.

All parties need to ensure that they have adequate processes and procedures in place related to the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of emulsion explosives. They also need to ensure that these methods are properly implemented. 2. In major hazard installations everyone is responsible for safety and following instructions. Managers need to ensure that regulatory requirements are met and corrective actions are adequate.3. In particular, it is essential to observe how changes in performance affect safety. Safety-critical changes may include a significant and rapid increase in production volumes, the use of new technology or new kinds of products, or changes relating to organisational structures and responsibilities, or supply chains. There is a need to organise training for personnel and to improve instructions to better identify and manage the effect of these changes on safety.4. In addition, there is a need to organise training for personnel and improve instructions related to the identification and handling of safety-critical non-conformities.5. The major accident scenarios presented in safety reports should be more systematically communicated when preparing internal and external emergency plans. In addition, training for those scenarios should be comprehensive.6. A complete reform of the Explosives Act is called for. To this end, the requirements should be updated to take account of the specific properties and risks connected with emulsion explosives."
343,1298,Major Accident,Processing of metals using electrolytic or chemical processes,Fire at a surface treatment facility,2021-05-13 07:25:00,2021-05-13 16:25:00,"A fire broke out at around 7:25 a.m. at a metal surface treatment facility with a footprint of 3,200 m². The building housed various treatment baths containing cadmium, cyanides and acids. The whole workshop caught fire at 8:55 a.m. and the fire alarm went off.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;","A trained and qualified staff member had put the equipment into safe mode (shutting off the water, shutting off the bath heating) the night before the accident (as confirmed by the CCTV cameras). The guard patrols conducted up until 6:00 a.m. (i.e. for 9 hours after the production staff had left) did not notice anything anomalous.
According to assessments carried out by the operator and the Industrial Risks Investigation and Analysis Office (BEA-RI), the fire appears to have broken out because of an electrical fault or electrical overheating linked to a metallic object being left on a tank. The procedure in place for closing down the workshops did not provide full protection against fire risks, and some electrical components (rectifier/filters) were still live as a result of how the installation was designed. In addition, the linear smoke detectors and optical flame detectors in the workshop did not detect the fire. This is because they had been inadvertently rendered inoperative due to being poorly positioned following works carried out a few months previously. This meant that the fire was not detected during the 90 minutes before the whole line caught fire.
The procedure in place for closing down the workshops did not provide full protection against the fire risks, and some electrical components (rectifier/filters) were still live as a result of how the installation was designed.","A large plume of black smoke was visible for kilometres around.
A security perimeter was put in place and four people living nearby were evacuated. Road traffic was closed off. A mosque located nearby was closed for the day.
Three firefighters were slightly hurt.
Cyanide traces were present in 120 m&sup3; of firewater. A waste management firm emptied the firewater retention tank and pumped out all of the products present in the circuit.
The production area affected was partially destroyed, specifically all of the treatment baths in the electroplating and oxidation workshops. The chemical store was not affected.
Tests on the large plume of smoke generated showed low concentrations of pollutants (VOCs, VOHCs, PAHs, inorganic acids, metals) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). No abnormally high levels of pollutants likely to have come from the facility (inorganic acids, cyanides, hexvalent chromium, metals, VOHCs) were detected in samples of wastewater or natural water. No traces were found of firewater leaking from the facility into the environment.","Firefighters arrived at the scene at 9:05 a.m. The electrical systems and extraction equipment were shut down. The various utilities were cut off (gas, water). Firewater was retained at the site. Staff arrived at 9:15 a.m. A large plume of black smoke was visible for kilometres around. A security perimeter was put in place and four people living nearby were evacuated. Road traffic was closed off. A mosque located nearby was closed for the day. The firefighters reported that the fire had been brought under control at 11:34 a.m. They announced at 4:24 p.m. that it had been put out. Firewater was retained at the site.","
Electrical supply should be cut in production areas outside of production hours;
Site closure procedures should be improved so as to ensure that checks are carried out properly (action to be recorded by the staff member who closes the site, and steps in the closure process to be checked by another qualified person);
The fire detection system should be improved with new detectors;
Chemical stocks should be kept as far away as possible from production areas;
Incompatible firewater (acids/cyanides) should be separated in the retention tanks;
A number of autonomous fire compartments should be created (five new fire compartments instead of a single fire compartment as was the case before the fire);
There should be easy access for emergency vehicles around the entire perimeter of the building.

344,143,Major Accident,Chemical installations - other fine chemicals,Ammonia Leak from high-pressure section of urea plant,2011-04-02 11:29:00,2011-04-02 13:15:00,"On 2&nbsp;April 2011, between 11.29 and 13.15, there was an emission of ammonia from the high-pressure section of a urea plant. In total, approximately 25&nbsp;000&nbsp;kg of ammonia was released into the atmosphere.  The incident was caused by a leak from an inlet pipe in the high-pressure system. This pipe is part of the high-pressure section of the urea plant, but no urea flows through it when the system is operating normally (dead branch).  The incident was caused by a corrosion mechanism which, due to the prevailing temperature gradient, led to an unexpectedly high degree of abrasion. It should be noted here that, in the context of work carried out while the system was out of operation in 2010, the main pipe was pressure-tested with 1.3 times the system pressure and the wall thickness was measured, with no abnormalities being detected in either case.  The system was isolated and the pressure reduced using valves and water walls were created by the on-site fire service to precipitate the ammonia. At the time of the incident weather conditions were sunny and stable with wind speeds of 3&nbsp;m/s.  There was no harm to any persons or the environment as a result of the incident. A public road was closed to traffic as a precaution. During the incident and until approximately 3 hours after the emission had ended, environmental measurements were taken as a precaution, both on and off site.  Safety measure: - Pressure reduced via a safety valve vent - Water walls created by fire service",See Accident Description.,Defective pipe,"- Environmental measurements
- Access roads closed ","To avoid similar incidents, similar parts (dead branches) of the urea plant were identified and inspected; this check did not indicate any corrosion.   The defective pipe was replaced and inspected after three, six, nine and twelve months, with no abnormalities being detected.  Inspections must currently be carried out every twelve months on the section of pipe concerned. The inspection results show that the material used in the past is suitable for use in the high-pressure section of urea plants. Nevertheless, the use of higher-quality, i.e. more corrosion-resistant, material is planned when critical pipes are replaced.  Furthermore, an additional risk-based inspection programme (RBI) is used to more effectively monitor parts of the process plants that are critical to the system.

345,920,Other Event,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Ignition of a vapour cloud and explosion by mixing and heating flammable liquids without adequate safety controls,2006-06-16 00:00:00,2006-06-16 00:00:00,"Ignition of a vapour cloud and explosion generated by mixing and heating a flammable liquid in an open top tank without adequate safety controls.

The accident has been investigated by the US Chemical Safety Board","As an operator was mixing and heating a flammable mixture of heptane and mineral spirits, he observed a dense fog accumulating on the floor below the tank. He notified a senior operator and both shut down the operation. They evacuated and warned other workers to do the same. After 10 minutes the cloud ignited and there was an explosion.Among the causes that led to the accident, the following can be cited:- The investigation after the accident revealed that the tank temperature controller had not been installed or maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications, which could have caused it to fail.- The mixing tank was not equipped with a temperature display or high temperature alarm, and there was no backup shutoff device. The procedure for this mixture required the operator to verify the temperature by climbing the stairs to the upper level to measure it using a hand-held infrared thermometer. If after checking the temperature, the mixture overheated, the operator would not know until the vapours overflowed from the tank.- The ventilation in the mixing area, consisting of local exhaust and area ventilation systems, was incapable of controlling vapours released from the tank, since it was not designed to capture and remove a high volume of vapours released from an open tank, and because&nbsp; two exhaust fan drive belts were broken before the incident. Regarding the area ventilation systems, they were located at a significant distance from the tank, so they were incapable of removing the vapours.- The mixing room was designed to avoid ignition sources, but the adjacent area where the cloud migrated and most likely ignited was not.Therefore, if the design for the process had included proper safety controls (i.e. local exhaust ventilation, high temperature alarm, and a backup steam shutoff) the vapours would not have overflowed the tank and migrated into the adjacent areas where multiple ignition sources existed.","One contracted delivery driver was killed and one employee was injured.

The fire and pressure from the initial ignition produced moderate damage to the structure and interrupted operations for nearly one month.","The worker in charge of the operation notified the situation to a senior operator as soon as he noticed the vapour cloud. They shut down the operation and advised workers in adjoining areas to leave. They warned the contracted driver to evacuate, but apparently he was talking on his cellular phone and did not hear them.The local Fire Department battled a fire confined to a bagged resin storage area for about 3-4 hours. Injured workers were taken to hospital, one of them died after several days, the other one stayed in hospital for 3 days.","The company suspended the flammable liquid mixing operation indefinitely.- A design professional should manage the design and construction of a facility that uses flammable liquids.- An experienced code reviewer knowledgeable in flammable and combustible liquid safety should thoroughly review facility design plans.- Facilities handling flammable and combustible liquids should implement an Emergency Action Plan and practice evacuation drills at least annually, but more frequently if necessary to keep employees prepared.&nbsp; "

The operator decided to change the storage of EPI by replacing the 210 l storing units with 60 m3 tank (C2). With this new tank also new loading station was set up for loading of EPI into C2.
EPI, like all chemicals that are stored in the storage area, are delivered to the site by ISO containers.
The operator was aware of the hazard arising from the fact that two incompatible substances were stored in the storage area: EPI and DETA (diethylenetriamine). When planning the change in storing and loading EPI, the operator aimed at realising the change that would inherently prevent mixing of incompatible substances. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The initial idea was to install loading devices which would support inherently safe loading of EPI by using specific coupling on the EPI station loading hose to be compatible only with a connector on the delivery hose of ISO container delivering EPI.
In the course of the change realisation it became evident that this idea was not a viable solution since the supplier of chemicals with ISO containers could not ensure ISO containers with specific connector for EPI deliveries only. This was due to the fact that all ISO containers – regardless the chemical they contain – are equipped with EURO connector.
Finally for the delivery of EPI the operator did install specific coupling (Camlock type D) in the EPI loading station which was different from couplings at loading stations of other chemicals (EURO coupling). Camlock coupling could be connected to ISO container with EURO connector only with the use of an adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The operator has due to change in the storage and loading of EPI modified the safety report, including HAZOP study. In this study a hazard of mixing incompatible substances has been recognised. This hazard has however not been recognised as possible cause of a major accident scenario. The HAZOP group recognised installation of specific coupling in combination with the identification of in-coming chemical as sufficient measure to prevent mixing of incompatible chemicals which could lead to an explosion.
On the day of the accident the immediate cause of the explosion were multiple human errors: the driver of ISO container with DETA parked the vehicle in front of the EPI loading station,&nbsp; the un-loading operator overlooked the hazardous substance label on the vehicle which clearly indicated that DETA was in the container, the un-loading operator also overlooked the indication in transport documentation that DETA has been delivered and finally he started loading DETA into wrong tank before having received the results of substance identification from the laboratory to which the sample of in-coming chemical has been sent. &nbsp;","Loss of life and injuries.

Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the origin of this decomposition: introduction of a reactive substance into the processing hopper or the presence of organic grease in the flow regulation valve originating from the maintenance operation, pollution in the filtration system (presence of humidity and organic dust after 4 weeks out of service) causing particles in decomposition to fall on to the packing machine, etc.","The sensors of the local air quality monitoring network did not detect any significant atmospheric pollution. 6 persons (2 operators, 2 firemen and 2 residents) were hospitalised, slightly unwell.

Exact quantities are not clear at present but best estimate is in the region of 7 to 30 tonnes. Total plant inventory is 1100 tonnes. The qualifying quantity is 5% of 200 tonnes ie 10 tonnes. ,"At 02.05 on 17th February 2008 during stable plant operations, DCS operator noted that pressure loss was occurring in a butane refrigerated storage tank. Ambient temperature outside was -7 degrees C, well below the boiling point of butane. Action to arrest pressure loss by increasing heat input to the tank failed. Inspection of the tank area showed common mode failure of three pilot operated fire safety valves (FSVs), which lifted below set pressure and released butane to atmosphere. Operators isolated FSVs, pressure restored to normal, release stopped.Common mode failure of FSVs. Tyco (Anderson Greenwood) 9200 series pilot operated diaphragm valves. Low ambient temperature caused butane to condense out in the valve dome and sense line, pressure dropped, which caused valve to open. Valve mechanically sound and correctly set but not suitable for butane duty at low ambient temperatures or other fluids where ambient temperature may drop to below boiling point/dew point of fluid.","The release did not ignite. There were no injuries or environmental harm, and no disruption to the local community. Those employees who carried out the emergency response were shaken.

356,567,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion at the naphtha stabilizer tower of the crude distillation unit in a petroleum refinery,1992-09-01 07:20:00,1992-09-01 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
The accident occurred at 7:20 a.m. during the shift change. The explosion was caused by the ignition of a vapor cloud of hydrocarbons (light naphtha, propane and butane). The possible source of the hydrocarbons release was the rupture of a 10"" pipe at the bottom of the Naphtha Stabilizer Tower. For about 1 - 1.5 minutes the cloud spread in a large area of the unit and was then ignited by some sources of ignition, exploding. The cloud explosion was then followed by a fire that was confined to the point where the leakage occurred and was totally extinguished at 11.20 a.m. There was an immediate information to the refinery fire brigade and the other refinery  (there is an agreement among the three Refineries to help one each other in case of accident). Five minutes later, the fire vehicles started arriving to Refinery Installations. Totally, there were 23 fire vehicles and 150 firemen plus the personnel of the refinery. One man was killed by the explosion and 33 people hospitalized with burns on their skin. When the Original Report was prepared 14 people had died (the other 13 died in the hospitals because of the burns).","CAUSES:
The explosion was caused by the ignition of an unconfined vapor cloud of hydrocarbons (light naphtha, propane and butane). When the Original Report was prepared the causes of the hydrocarbons release were not fully identified (the results of the analysis will be transmitted as soon as they will be available) but, probably, the possible source was the rupture of a 10"" pipe at the bottom of the naphtha stabilizer tower.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 14 people were killed by the explosion (1 person died immediately, the others 13 died in the hospital because of the burns) and 33 people were injured by the explosion (13 out of 33 died in the hospitals because of the burns). On site, there were about 150 firemen from the other two refineries and
Fire Brigades.MATERIAL LOSS:The cost of the material losses (damages to equipments, piping, instrumentation, electrical cables of the distillation unit, glass windows of the surrounding buildings) has been evaluated in about 14,000,000 Euros.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The traffic was deviated away from the Refinery vicinity.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The location of the establishment is shown on a map (scale 1:10.000) attached to the Original Report.Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Immediate activation of the emergency plans which worked out as foreseen. Transfer of the wounded to the hospital and removal of the personnel not involved in fire fighting. Manual shut-down of all the units. Extinction of the fire.EXTERNAL SERVICES:There was an immediate information to the fire brigade. Five minutes later, the fire vehicles started arriving to refinery installations. Totally, there were 23 fire vehicles and 150 firemen plus the personnel of the refinery.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Deviation of the traffic away from the refinery vicinity.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).Emergency measures taken Offsite: external services: traffic controlEmergency measures taken Onsite: internal systems: plant emergency shut-down proceduresEmergency measures taken Onsite: internal systems: internal emergency teams (fire, ambulance, etc.)Emergency measures taken Onsite: external services: external fire-fighting servicesEmergency measures taken Onsite: evacuation: all or mostly by personal transport","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident it was established to carry out improved safety audits. On the basis of the results and of the experience gained by the inspection of the equipment and HAZOP analysis of the plant, it was decided to tighten inspection intervals.

The affected refinery equipments were checked and, where necessary, they had been repaired or replaced."
357,532,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Uncontrolled release of molten sodium from ISO tank container with subsequent ignition caused by uman error,1999-11-07 11:05:00,1999-11-07 15:00:00,"Uncontrolled release of molten sodium from ISO tank container with subsequent ignition. The incident was reportable because more than 250 people offsite were confined for more than 2 hours to avoid exposure to combustion products.Unusual operation (melting tank contents and repressurising) carried out over 3 shifts. The supervisor on the day shift received the tank and attempted to connect it to the tank heating system over several hours. He failed to complete the work, leaving it to the the night shift. The night shift staff successfully completed this connection and applied heating. They next tried to connect the off-loading line through which a fresh nitrogen blanket was to be applied. This took time. They omitted to vent (depressurise) the tank as required during the period when the heating was applied, but were distracted by other problems. When going off shift, they left a verbal message to the day shift supervisor to vent the tank to depressurise it. This message was either not passed on, or ignored (accounts from the individuals conflict). The day shift supervisor did not vent the tank and tried to clear the blockage by inserting a heated metal rod in the discharge port to break the solid ""plug"" of sodium, resulting in the incident. He was aware of the risks and correct procedure but failed to follow it. No suggestion of wilful disregard for procedure, rather of human error.","Operator (shift supervisor) attempted to clear blocked valve by insertion of heated rod through valve port to heat solidified crust of sodium. The tank was pressurised with nitrogen and sodium erupted under pressure when blockage cleared. Unsafe method used by operator.An experienced, trained, supervisor found a blockage in the discharge valve and attempted to clear it by inserting a heated metal rod. This caused the release of internal pressure in the tank, ejecting molten sodium. The system was vulnerable to human error and communication across shifts failed in that a reminder to the supervisor to vent the tank was not recognised.Shortcomings were
identified in the management system with regard to:
use of standard operating procedures;
competence of supervision;
communication across shifts;
vulnerability of the system to human error.
However, the man who initiated the incident was competent to deal with
the situation and admitted that he omitted to carry out a critical step
contrary to written instructions.","Installation and ISO tank container seriously damaged. Off site population in vicinity of establishment required to remain indoors for duration of incident. Number not known at this stage but more than 500 people for 2 hours.The incident was only deemed a major accident as more than 250 people were confined for more than 2 hours to avoid exposure to the cloud. The worst possible effects of the cloud would have been mild irritation of eyes and mucous membranes. The operators asserted that an off-site emergency was declared as a precautionary measure (agreed by the emergency services). This involved radio announcements and information given to the local authority and significant retail developments. They also claimed that despite the inconvenience, the public preferred to have been warned of the incident rather than have been left in ignorance with an obvious cloud approaching them. They stated that this attitude was confirmed at subsequent community liaison meetings. Some residents expressed concern to the Member of Parliament for the local constituency and these have been discussed with the Competent Authority (HSE), as a a result of which a local COMAH liaison committee has been established involving all relevant stakeholders including COMAH establishments, emergency services, local community and Competent Authorities.The off-loading building was destroyed but no other physical damage sustained to other parts of the establishment. Effects on the establishment were confined to disruption during the incident, when fire figting, subsequent loss of use of the destroyed plant, and management time taken in responding to the community and Competent Authorities. Off-site effects were short-term disruption in response to the major hazard alarm, confinement of members of the public for the duration of the incident, and short-term closure of a nearby motorway.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",On site emergency response team activated. Off site emergency services summoned. 11 fire appliances and 55 fire fighting personnel attended. Reduced to 2 fire appliances and 10 fire fighters overnight once incident was under control. Spillage contained and blanketed with salt to prevent escalation. Off site population warned by siren and local radio/television. Fire controlled and extinguished in approximately 3 hours. Emergency services remained on site until spillage made safe. Incident declared over after 6.5 hours. Fire Service retained an overnight presence  in case of re-ignition. The Competent Authority (HSE) staff oversaw a long and complex remediation to prevent recurrence and risk to on site personnel.Official action taken - other official action: The operator was required to prepare an action plan to address all matters of concern. Progress with implementing the plan is being closely monitored by the Competent Authority (HSE) inspectors.,"Immediate lessons: System of work for clearing blockages unsafe;
the ISO tank should have been vented to relieve pressure before work
commenced. Shift change procedures, particularly communication, need
improvement. On site and off site emergency response were both measured
and effective.Measures to prevent recurrence: As well as addressing the organisational issues noted above, the operator has rebuilt the facility to a much higher standard. Physical controls will be installed to ensure correct sequence of operation and additional containment and mitigation measures will be installed. HSE is undertaking a local project assessing the adequacy of communications at shift handover at a number of COMAH establishments.Measures to mitigate consequences: The off site investigation revealed some confusion in the local community with regard to the type and meaning of alarms and sirens. This operator is located among a number of high hazard plants. All sites have been required to co-operate in developing a coordinated system of alarms and for ensuring effective information is given to the public in the event of an incident. As mentioned above, some residents expressed concerns to their Member of Parliament for the local constituency and these have been discussed with the Competent Authority (HSE), as a result of which a local COMAH liaison committee has been established involving all relevant stakeholders including COMAH establishments, emergency services, local community and Competent Authorities."

359,910,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Leak in the diesel desulphurisation unit at a refinery,2011-04-28 15:40:00,2011-04-28 17:50:00,"At 15:40 the workers of a refinery discovered a leak of aerosolised hydrocarbon fuel (HC: gas oil, hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide) in the gas oil desulphurising unit. This caused a release of hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide above the desulphurising unit. The leak was located at the exit of the desulphurisation reactor, at the level of the air coolers.",The study conducted by the operator shows that the leak came from a perforation in a bundle of ordinary carbon steel tubes in one of the four air coolers of the unit. This was caused by corrosion linked to the presence of ammonium disulphides produced by the combination of H2S from desulphurisation and of nitrogen from denitrification in the reactor. Water is constantly injected upstream in order to dissolve this substance and prevent deposition. The unit was modified five years earlier to meet the specifications for low-sulphur fuels. This may have played a role in the accident by increasing denitrification in the reactor and therefore the concentration of corrosive products. corrosion,"The unit was decompressed (20-bar network) through flaring and then degassed using nitrogen. There were no victims, but residents of the neighbouring municipality located downwind started complaining about odours late in the afternoon. The sensors of the municipality confirmed that the recommended information threshold for sulphur dioxide (SO2) was exceeded between 16:00 and 17:00. The operator suffered production losses of several million euros owing to the slow-down of the units on the platform, the 15-day closure of the desulphurising unit and non-desulphurised gas oils, which are harder to sell.","The worker responsible for control of the unit activated its automatic shutdown and the water curtains of the oven. The internal rescue team was alerted at 15:45, and at 15:47 the 1 500 employees of the platform (refinery + petrochemicals) were ordered to remain indoors. The operator launched the internal operating plan at 15:50 and the internal rescue team installed water curtains around the unit. The public rescue services sent a fire officer to the operator's facility.","Below are the lessons learned by the operator:
-	this type of equipment is difficult to inspect, because a single non-compliant bend out of 368 caused the accident;
-	the inspections carried out were appropriate for detecting zones of erosion in the bends, which can be found by radiography because of their highly irregular surface. However, the method was unsuitable for this type of corrosion, located downstream from the seam joint on the right side of the tube, resulting in an even surface with very irregular wear on the edge of the seam joint.
The operator decided to install during the next stoppage in 2012 new air coolers using metal that is more resistant to this type of corrosion and a design better adapted to bends/seam joints."

Analysis of the smoke revealed the presence of sulphur derivatives (H2S, CS2, SO2) and HCN. Although the concentrations of CS2 exceeded the toxicity threshold (VME 10 ppm) above the seat of the fire, no excess was noted for the different pollutants at the limits of the site. The slow combustion of chemicals continued under the surveillance of the fire brigade with gaseous fumes being given off over a period of several days.
The thousands of tonnes of substances (toxic and highly toxic) involved in the fire resulted in a quantity of dangerous matter being released of more than 5% over the Seveso threshold for toxic (44 %) and highly toxic (495 %) substances.
","The cause of the fire is unknown. There has been a legal inquiry and the insurance company has appointed experts.

","5 fire-fighters were injured (nausea, burns). An acrid odour could be smelled some tens of kilometres away, 3,000 people were advised to stay indoors at home or at work. Although no health impact is feared on the face of it, the smoke inconvenienced locals and those at work in businesses in the industrial zone. Analysis of the smoke revealed that it contained sulphur components (H2S, CS2, SO2) and HCN. Although concentrations of CS2 exceeded the toxicity threshold (VME 10 ppm) above the seat of the fire, the various pollutants did not exceed thresholds at the limits of the site.The 4 buildings (7,500 m²) and 1,700 t of plant protection products were destroyed. The property damage and operating losses amount to 40 M euros. Several companies in the area had to suspend business on the day of the accident.","The Onsite Emergency Response Plan was triggered, then the Offsite Emergency Plan at 4.22 a.m..A flour silo and light structures were protected by water spray. Extinguishing water (500 m3/h) recovered in a retention system at the lower part or site was pumped and transferred by a specialist company, following a failure of the booster pump, to a 10,000 m3 tank. About a hundred fire-fighters brought the fire under control by late morning.A 400 m perimeter of confinement was implemented around the site.A mobile measuring station, located downwind and 200 m from the site, should, in particular, record the concentration in the air of sulphur-containing products.",The Prefect's Order dated 29/06 suspended operation of the site and restricts the start-up of equipment not damaged by the fire until complete refurbishment of safety systems.

It seems to be when a worker was keeping up some production samples.The consecutive explosions were expanded through the powder and colours storage dumps, reaching the assembly area.(See a drawing of the plant&nbsp;attached in the&nbsp;Confidential&nbsp;Section). As the emergency teams reported, an industrial truck parked in the&nbsp;vicinities&nbsp;and loaded with explosive materials, could increase the aftermath and contributed the blast wave to propagate. ","Due to the significant destruction of the plant, it is very difficult to find out the accurate cause.

By 9:00 p.m. the fire had been put out and the internal emergency plan was lifted at 9:45 p.m.
&nbsp;
The two investigations carried out by the operator did not definitively establish the cause of the fire. The first hypothesis would be an ignition of electrical origin; the suspected equipment is a pump motor and its electrical connection socket. The second hypothesis would be ignition linked to the presence of zirconium; the satin finish generates zirconium fines, the spontaneous ignition of which in the open air is possible.
&nbsp;
The fact that the packed tower scrubber did not stop extracting fumes despite the emergency shutdown of the machine was undoubtedly an aggravating factor in the accident.","Hypothesis 1: electrical equipment malfunction (suspected pump motor) - The motor may not have been electrically protected (or may have been badly protected).
Hypothesis 2: ignition of zirconium particles in the satin finishing room: incandescent fine zirconium filings may have been sucked in by the vent shaft. In order to prevent ignition, water was sprayed onto the satin finishing brushes but the flow rate may have been insufficient or the nozzles may have been poorly positioned.
Propagation of the fire via the vent shaft (aggravating factor): the fact that the packed tower scrubber did not stop extracting fumes despite the emergency shutdown of the machine was undoubtedly an aggravating factor in the accident.",Material damage at the site: EUR 2.5 million,"At around 8:00 p.m., the staff member operating the line where surface finishing takes place (the strip finishing line) heard a dull noise coming from the equipment. He noted contractions/retractions on the gas discharge pipe. While inspecting the equipment from all angles by looking through the observation windows, he saw flames and smoke in the vicinity of the vent shaft and the back of the machine.He therefore set off the equipment’s nitrogen inerting system and the One Seven foam extinguishing system.The evacuation of the site was ordered at 8:04 p.m. and the emergency services (fire brigade) were called.

367,550,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion and fire of a vapour cloud escaped from a Saturate Gas Plant de-ethaniser column due to a overhead line failure,2001-04-16 14:20:00,2001-04-16 17:20:00,"Saturate Gas Plant, de-ethaniser column overhead line failure resulting in an inventory loss greater than the 5% Shedule 1 threshold for extremely flammable gases. The escaping gas formed a vapour cloud which subsequently exploded.A catastrophic failure occurred on a section of pipework on the Saturate Gas Plant (SGP), at an elbow just downstream of a water-into-gas injection point. The 6 inch diameter pipe (the overhead line carrying flammable gas under high pressure) ruptured releasing a huge cloud containing around 90% ethane/propane/butane. About 20-30 seconds later the gas cloud ignited, resulting in a massive explosion and fire.The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf","The primary cause of the explosion was the erosion/corrosion of the 6 inch diameter pipe which carried the overhead line from the De-ethaniser to the Heat Exchanger in the Saturate Gas Plant (SGP). The failure occurred downstream of, and in close proximity to, a water injection point that was not part of the original design.Examination of the failed elbow of the pipework showed that it had failed due to an 'erosion/corrosion' damage mechanism which, over time, had reduced the wall thickness at the outside of the elbow to such an extent that the wall could no longer withstand the internal pressure within the pipe. The wall thickness had been reduced from around 7-8mm to a minimum of 0.3mm. When the pipe failed, it burst open catastrophically,causing a 'full-bore' type of release of the pipe's contents.Metallurgical examination of the pipe revealed that the uncorroded sections of the pipe were internally coated with black iron slphide, known as the 'passivation' layer which, once formed, serves to protect the carbon steel material from further corrosion. However, when the water injection was in operation it washed away the protective coating leaving it open to attack by corrosive agents in the gas stream. Hence the elbow was subject to erosion/corrosion, a process that resulted in the thinning of the pipe wall and eventual failure.The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf","Area concerned - remarks:The Saturate Gas Plant (SGP) suffered very heavy damage as a result of the force of the blast. Fortunately no one had been in the direct path of the the estimated 175 x 80 metres gas cloud when it exploded. The resultant fire caused further and substantial damage to the SGP. Other buildings on the refinery, up to 400 metres away from the source of the explosion, were badly damaged.The refinery was shut down completely for several weeks following the explosion, followed by a phased start up.An adjacent oil refinery also sustained damage to buildings, although the process plant was unaffected.The explosion caused widespread damage to houses and businesses within a 1km radius of the site. Around 370 individual reports were made of damage to buildings, mainly broken windows and cracks to ceilings and walls. There is evidence of residents suffering shock and distress by the blast, although they were not injured. 71 civil claims for injury damage are being pursued by members of the public.Debris from the explosion was spread over a wide area. It littered a nearby road to the extent that emergency services had to slow down to negotiate their way through it. Some debris, mainly cladding, was thrown into the air and found betwen 500 metres and 5km away.People - remarks:The incident occurred on a public holiday (Easter Monday) when there were only 185 people on site, rather than the normal number of about 800. One minor on-site injury, two superficial off-site injuries. The explosion caused widespread damage to houses and businesses within a 1km radius of the site. Around 370 individual reports were made of damage to buildings, mainly broken windows and cracks to ceilings and walls. There is evidence of residents suffering shock and distress by the blast, although they were not injured. 71 civil claims by members of the public for injury damage are being pursued.Material Loss - remarks:As well as the material loss mentioned above: Following the HSE investigation into the incident, the company were prosecuted for health and safety breaches and were fined a total of approx 1 million euros with costs of 300,000 euros.Community Disruption:Police closed off roads around the refinery, nearby residents were informed to close windows and remain indoors, ambulances were summoned to the site and the local Hospital instigated its major incident procedure. An adjacent oil refinery also sustained damage to buildings, although the process plant was unaffected.Debris from the explosion was spread over a wide area. It littered a nearby road to the extent that responding emergency services had to slow down to negotiate their way through it. Some debris, mainly cladding, was thrown into the air and found between 500 metres and 5km away.The incident received local and national press coverage.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","Emergency measures - Remarks: The ConocoPhillips Emergency Response Team led the fire-fightiing effort with the Humberside Fire Service attending; fire crew from an adjacent oil refinery also assisted them as part of the existing mutual aid scheme. 

The incident occurred at 14.21 hours and the refinery general alarm was sounded shortly afterwards. At 14.40 the refinery was shut down because the fire appeared to be out of control. By approximately 15.30 the fire was under control and it was largely extinguished by 17.10 and recorded by the Humberside Fire Service as 'struck out' at 21.01 hours.

The off-site emergency alarm (Community Alarm) was not sounded at any point during the incident. ConocoPhillips view is that this off-site emergency alarm is only used for foreseen toxic gas releases. The damage caused from the incident was immediate and without warning. The off-site emergency plan was not put into effect. Following the investigation, recommendations were made to improve the procedures for calling the emergency services, and for deciding when, and by whom, the the off-site alarm should be sounded.

In addition to the Humberside Fire Service, the other emergency services committed significant resources to tackle the incident; Police closed off roads around the refinery, nearby residents were informed to close windows and remain indoors, ambulances were summoned to the site and the local Hospital instigated its major incident procedure. Whilst the property damage in the area was extensive, fortunately there were no serious injuries.
Seveso II duties  - remarks: Although there was an
off-site emergency plan for this establishment, it was not initiated in
response to this incident. There was also uncertainty as to who was
responsible for calling the emergency services.
Following the investigation it was recommended that:

a) the procedures should be reviewed to clarify who calls the emergency
services, which services should be contacted and the circumstances
under which they should be called. All documents and call lists should
be revised as appropriate.

b) the circumstances under which the off-site alarm is to be sounded,
and the person who has the responsibility to sound it, should be
clarified, and this should be written in to the emergency on-site
procedures.
Official action taken - legal action: Following the investigation into the incident, ConocoPhillips Limited were charged with a number of offences. They pleaded guilty to the charges under Sections 2 and 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, that:a) at the Humber Refinery between 1 January 1996 and 17 April 2001, they did not ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of their employees; and that b) they also failed to conduct the undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable, that&nbsp; persons not in their employment who might thereby be affected, were not exposed to risks to their health and safety.The company were fined £400,000 on each charge with costs of £218,854. They were also fined £20,000 for offences concerning pressure systems legislation.Official action taken - other action: HSE served an Improvement Notice on ConocpoPhillips Limited on 1 July 2001 requiring them to draw up an action plan for implementing the provisions of a suitable industry standard for pipework inspections at the refinery and address the corrosion management deficiencies found. This Improvement Notice was complied with.HSE issued a Safety Alert to other UK oil refineries advising them of the need to have effective inspection systems in place around water injection points in process lines, particularly if they are close to bends in the pipework.","Measures to prevent recurrence: Actions taken:a.The company undertook a piping inspection programme 'Hawkeye' at all the higher risk refinery piping systems. This was essentially a Risk Based Inspection review and as a result approximately 3,200 lines were inspected - about 15% of the total refinery system. Another project 'Project 570' was initiated to review the remaining 85% of refinery piping, and 62,000 inspection locations were reviewed, following the guidance in the American Institute Piping Inspection Code API 570, covering the inspection, repair alteration and re-rating of in-service piping systems.b. ConocoPhillips senior management requested a third party audit of all their facilities worldwide, both upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining and marketing). This was conducted by specialist consultants with a worldwide reputation in the field of process safety.c. The refinery organisational structure was revised to provide clearer definitions of the responsibilities for mechanical integrity. Inspection and mechanical integrity and their associated actions are key risk control activities, and the monitoring of their performance metrics are reviewed routinely by the refinery leadership team. Conclusions and lessons learned:a. Management of pipework inspectionConocoPhillips failed to implement an effective system for the inspection of pipework on the Saturate Gas Plant (SGP), to complement that in place for process equipment. The system fell far below recognised industry good practice at the time.&nbsp; In addition they failed to use knowledge and experience from other sections of the plant that should have identified the need for more inspection of the SGP pipework. Over time sufficient pipework condition data should have been obtained, and entered onto an inspection database, to verify the believed integrity and inform assessments of future inspection requirements. Without this both the system and the assessments were inadequate.Key lessons:- Effective pipework inspection systems are a vital major accident prevention measure for high hazard pipework.- Such systems should at least meet current industry good practice standard- Decisions on inspection intervals should be informed by suitable and sufficient information on process conditions and previous inspection findings.b. Management of changeThe design and installation of the water injection point in the pipe was not subject to any management of change assessment. Had such an assessment been carried out, the corrosion risk that the injection point introduced for the downstream pipework could have been identified. Similarly no assessment was made of the changes in the use of the water injection point, between continuous and intermittent, over the lifetime of the plant. The frequency of use was a major factor in the rate of the corrosion of the pipework. During periods of continued use more frequent or detailed inspections of the pipework should have taken place to adequately monitor the integrity of the pipe.Key lessons:- Effective management of change systems, which consider both plant and process modifications, are essential to prevent major accidents.- Particular care is needed to ensure that 'quick fix' modifications, during the commissioning and early operation phases of new plant, are covered.c. Management of corrosionConocoPhillips corrosion management on the SGP was not sufficiently thorough or systematic to prevent the failure of the pipe. Some positive actions were taken, including the appointment of a full-time corrosion engineer for the refinery, the introduction of divisional corrosion reviews and monitoring of process streams by sampling, and the installation of corrosion probes, following receipt of specific information in 1992 about the vulnerability of carbon steel pipework in the vicinity of water injection points. Unfortunately these activities were allowed to lapse with the result that there was both insufficient data on, and inadequate resource or focus applied to, corrosion as a potential major accident initiator on the SGP.Key lessons:- Systematic and thorough arrangements are necessary for the effective management of corrosion on major hazard installations.- Such arrangements should ensure that any available information on relevant corrosion degradation mechanisms is identified and acted on.- Adequate resource, including relevant expertise, should be applied to ensure that adequate standards are achieved and maintained.d. CommunicationTwo significant communication failings contributed to this incident. Firstly the various changes to the frequency of use of of the water injection point were not communicated outside plant operations personnel. As a result there was a belief elsewhere that it was in occasional use only and did not constitute a corrosion risk. Secondly, information from the injection point inspection, which was carried out in 1994, was not adequately recorded or communicated, with the result that the recommended further inspections of the pipe were never carried out.These failings were confirmed in a subsequent detailed inspection of specific human factors issues at the refinery. Safety communications were found to be largely 'top-down' instructions related to personal safety issues, rather than seeking to involve the workforce in the active prevention of major accidents. The inspection identified that there was insufficient attention on the refinery to the management of process safety.Key lessons:&nbsp;- Effective communication is an important element of any safety management system. In the context of major hazard establishments the accurate recording and effective sharing of information and data relevant to plant corrosion is essential for major accident prevention.- Communication systems should aim to actively involve the workforce in the prevention of major accidents as part of an adequately resourced process safety management system.Measures to mitigate consequences: Specialist consultants were employed to review the blast damage and explosion over-pressure calculations to improve predictive knowledge. Software used to predict explosion over-pressure was updated and used for all the Humber refinery occupied building risk assessments.Recommendations were made to improve the procedures for calling the emergency services, and for deciding when, and by whom, the the off-site alarm should be sounded.Lessons from the emergency response on-site and off-site were shared with local industries, emergency planning and the emergency services through the local Major Hazards Group. A process was set up to handle concerns among the community and to carry out repairs in a timely fashion. An additional off-site community alarm was installed to cover South Killingholme residents furthest away from the refinery who could not always hear the existing alarm.Useful references: The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf"

373,22,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Leakage of liquid vinyl chloride from a ruptured corroded pipe after wrong admission in the degassing system,1988-08-17 23:10:00,1988-08-17 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
A corroded pipe in the degassing system ruptured after the wrong admission of liquid vinyl chloride and a leakage of about 4 tonnes of this substance occurred before its isolation. A layer of the escaped gas developped close to the drain ditches of the area where the leakage occurred. The vinyl chloride vapours, being 2.5 times heavier than air, remained closed to the ground. The slightly elevated rails of the railway serving the area acted initially as a dike and contained the gas cloud. Atmospheric conditions and  water curtains created by the plant fire brigade managed to contain the cloud close to the leakage point until it had been diluted by convection. The evaporation of liquid vinyl chloride had been promoted by the water draining from the water curtains. The source of the release was identified 45 minutes after the leakage was detected; the leaking pipeline was isolated soon after that. The company firemen checked the roads around the factory with explosimeters and the response was negative everywhere. Besides, they irrigated the area where the leakage occurred and made a screen from each side. The Security chief called Service 100 to signal the leak and to ask the firemen to take up position around the factory in case gas layer moved to the outside. Sambreville fire brigade was called and took position around the plant fence on the side opposite the site of the leak but its intervention was not necessary, since repeated gas concentration measuremets at the boundary of the factory resulted negative. The railway traffic in the city of Jemeppe was interrupted during the accident, from 23:32 till 03:08 next morning. The goods trains were stopped where they were whilst the international traffic was diverted via Brussels. The leakage had been detected at 23:10, the leaking point had been identified at 23:55 and the piping isolation took place around 00:05. From this moment, the leakage was decreasing until the gas cloud was practically dispersed at 01:30. More detailed information about the accident are available on the document "" Accident which occurred on 17th August, 1988 at the SOLVIC monomer Centre at Jemeppe-sure-Sambre.

An inexperienced new operator (17 years old) had to mix 2 chemicals for the first time. He got a prescription of the proceedings but he was not under supervision. By unacquaintance of chemicals and their names, he took by mistake sulphuric acid instead of sodium sulphate. An exothermic chemical reaction, which could not be stopped, occurred resulting in the release of chlorine and hydrogen chloride into the building and, then, into the environment (the building was well vented). The operator, as soon as he detected an abnormal amount of smoke that was developping from the mixer, stopped it and pressed the alarm. The local fire brigade started to cool the mixer until the unwanted reaction stopped. The local fire-brigade also measured the concentrations of chlorine and hydrogen chloride inside the building. No action to alert the population was carried out because the measured concentrations inside the building did not exceed several times the MAC-values of chlorine (1.5 mg/m3) and hydrogen chloride (7 mg/m3). The dimensions of the cloud outside the building are not known. Toxic effects (irritation) in the neighbourhood were limited within a distance of 100 metres. Unfortunately, the toxic fumes were sucked in by the ventilation system of a nearby factory. As a consequence, 29 employees of this neighbouring company were intoxicated. 30 people were referred to a hospital: 1 operator from Biesterfeld &amp; Co and 29 employees of this neighbouring company. After examination, 12 people were taken in for observation whilst 18 people were sent home.",INITIATING EVENTS AND CONSEQUENCES:An inexperienced operator had to mix two chemicals. By mistake he took sulphuric acid instead of sodium sulphate. An exothermic reaction occurred resulting in the release of chlorine and hydrogen chloride into the environment.CAUSES:The accident occurred because:1- an inexeperienced new operator (17 years old) had to mix two chemicals for the first time but no supervision on process safety was carried out;2- by mistake he took sulphuric acid instead of sodium sulphate and an unexpected chemical reaction occurred; 3- no emergency measures for exothermic reactions in the mixing room were available.,"EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:1 operator of Biesterfield &amp; Co was hospitalized due to intoxication caused by the toxic cloud of chlorine and hydrogen chloride.Since the concentrations of toxic substances measured inside the building did not exceeded several times the MAC-values for chlorine and hydrogen chloride (toxic effects [irritation] were limited within a distance of 100 metres), no action to alert the population was carried out. Unlucky, the released toxic fumes were sucked in by the ventilation system of a nearby factory and, as a consequence, 29 employees of this neighbouring company were referred to a hospital together with the intoxicated operator of Biesterfeld &amp; Co. After examination, 12 people were taken in for observation and 18 were sent home.MATERIAL LOSS:No data are available about the cost of the pollution in the mixing room where the accident occurred.Disruption of community life: The local fire brigade measured the gas concentration inside the building but no action was carried out to alert the population because it did not exceeded several times times the MAC-values of chlorine (1.5 mg/m3) and hydrogen chloride (7 mg/m3).

387,485,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Severe explosion in a nitric acid manufacturing installation,2001-09-21 10:17:00,2001-09-21 00:00:00,"At 10.17 am, a severe explosion (detonation) occurred in shed 221. The detonation, felt several kilometres away, corresponded to a magnitude of 3.4 on the Richter scale. Significant dust fallout from the installations and a crater were observed outside the plant. A large cloud of dust from the detonation and red smoke drifted to the north-west. The appearance of the smoke is linked to the emergency shutdown of the nitric acid manufacturing installation. Before rapidly dissipating, the cloud containing ammonia and nitrogen oxides sickened witnesses who complained of eye and throat irritations. The atmospheric pollutants released after the detonation lead to the formation of nitric acid (HNO3), ammonia (NH3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from ammonium nitrate. As a precautionary measure, the local governmental authority (“Préfecture”) requested that the population of Toulouse confine themselves to their homes. This measure, the efficiency of which was limited owing to the damage to numerous homes, nevertheless reduced the number of traffic problems after the accident. From a strictly technical point of view, and according to the measures and observations made by the experts, it should be noted that the detonation gave rise to an overpressure in the order of 140 mbar (threshold retained to characterise the lethal effects in the danger studies) at a distance between 280 and 350 m and 50 mbar (threshold retained to characterise the irreversible effects on human health in the danger studies) at a distance between 680 and 860 m. This observation can be constructively compared to the fact that there were victims resulting from indirect effects up to 500 m away on the one hand, and injuries caused by broken glass at distances of a few kilometres away, on the other hand.","On the eve of the explosion, 15 to 20 tons of ammonium nitrates with an additive in qualification phase was brought into shed 221. On the morning of the explosion, products derived from the packaging of the ammonium nitrates and the manufacturing shops were also transferred into the shed. The last addition of material by bin coming from another storage zone was made less than 30 min before the explosion Several inquiries and expert evaluations were conducted: - judicial inquiry, - administrative inquiry conducted by the French Ministry of the Environment with the participation of industrial hazard experts [3], -ATOFINA (mother group) internal inquiry, - inquiry by the CHSCT (the plant committee for hygiene, safety and working conditions). Many hypotheses were formulated to explain the explosion: Unintentional external causes associated with accidental technological or natural phenomena (methane due to underground bacterial activity, lightning, meteorite, falling aircraft parts, explosion of a bomb or nitrocellulose underground following previous site activity); all of these hypotheses proved to be unfounded. Intentional external causes (attack, malicious mischief, missile) conjured up and spread by public opinion in the same context as the ""Twin Towers"" terrorist attack in New York, on September 11, 2001. From a legal standpoint, this hypothesis is not supported by any tangible facts. A process incident (an internal electrical fault at the plant, electric arc, missile effect from a part projected at high speed…). An examination of manufacturing parameters at the time of accident would not however explain this type of incident. Concerning the possible high speed projection of a piece of metal causing a primary explosion in a filter at the top of a tower near the site of the explosion, experts feel that the kinetic energy developed by the projection of debris from the filter would be insufficient to cause the nitrate contained in shed 221 to explode.As far as an accidental chemical reaction is concerned, the nitrates used were polluted by iron oxides, sulphur and in contact with bitumen used to pave the floor of shed 221 or following the mixture of incompatible chemical substances, such as ammonium nitrate with sodium dichlorocyanurate (NaDCC, a product used in treating swimming pools); the incompatibility of these substances was highlighted during court-ordered laboratory tests. Favoured differently by the entities concerned, none of these hypotheses have lead to a consensus. In may 2006, the final report presented by the expert investigators to the plaintiffs supports the theory of a chemical accident, attributing the causes of the disaster to an unfortunate combination of a few dozen kilos of sodium dichlorocyanurate with 500 kg of ammonium nitrate spilled on the main nitrate pile 20 minutes before the detonation. It is worth noticing that, since the very beginning of the industrial manufacturing of nitrogenous fertilisers early in the 20th century, ammonium nitrate have been involved in several major industrial accidents while being stored or dispatched . On July 26, 1921 in Kriewald (formerly German Silesia), the ""dislodging"" of wagons filled with ammonium nitrate using explosives caused a detonation killing 19. Less than 2 months later, on September 21st, in Germany's Oppau plant, blasting work on a pile of aggregated fertiliser mix containing ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate produced a detonation responsible for 561 deaths, 1,952 injured and the near total destruction of the town. Twenty years after that, in Belgium, explosives were still being used to disaggregate a pile of ammonium nitrate, resulting in another several hundred deaths at Tessenderlo. Despite the production of coated nitrate to subsequently avoid nitrate aggregation, several detonations of ammonium nitrate still occurred either in France or abroad, thus confirming the complex characteristics (e.g. chemical composition, particle distribution, density, humidity) associated with these categories of products and their detonation potential under circumstances promoting their instability: mixing, hazardous outcome when reacting with other materials or pollutants, temperature, containment…","< HUMAN At the time of the explosion, 266 plant employees and 100 agents from sub-contracting companies were present at the site. The accident resulted in many casualties: 21 at the AZF site, 1 at SNPE and 9 people outside the site (2 of which were in hospital) who were killed by the explosion or deceased in the days that followed, more than 30 people were seriously injured of which 21 remained hospitalised for more than one month (300 more than 6 days). A student at the Gallieni professional college, located 500 m from the epicentre, was killed and several other injured when a concrete structure collapsed. Two people also died in a vehicle maintenance establishment located 380 m away and one person died in the EDF (Electricity company) building located 450 m from the epicentre. Thousands of people were hospitalised; the local authority (Préfecture de Haute-Garonne) counted a total of 2,442 people as of October 17, 2001; 8042 peoples are submitted to a legal medical investigation. The INVS (health national institute) and the Midi-Pyrénées DRASS (local health authority) published a progress report in July 2002 and a final report in September 2006 on the sanitary consequences of the explosion [2].
The information gathered during this epidemiological study allowed the short term impact of the catastrophe to be assessed by clearly identifying the sanitary effects of the environmental exposures and by describing the physical and psychological traumas. Numerous physical traumas are registered: wounds, fractures, amputations, contusions… Auditory troubles resulting from the double effect of the blast and to the acoustic trauma due to the explosion were extensive: partial or total deafness, pierced eardrums, hypoacousia, tinnitus, otalgia… Among the nearly 6,000 students located in a radius of 2 km around the site who underwent testing 8 to 10 weeks after the explosion, 5.5% of the secondary school children and 6.3% of the primary school/kindergarten children suffer from hearing deficiencies (> 25 dB). Health professionals were recommended to conduct hearing deficiency examinations on the individuals who were within a radius of 1.7 km at the time of the explosion. The NO2, the NH3 and the particles released by the explosion were responsible for transitory ocular (conjunctivitis, vision disabilities…) and respiratory irritations (tracheobronchitis…) in the population living near the site. These problems appeared to decrease within 5 weeks after the accident. However, the collected data allow to establish the absence of significant health effects potentially associated with these substances in the short and long term. According to the heath services and considering toxicological and epidemiological knowledge on the exposure-hazard relationship, it appears that there are no disquieting consequences concerning the health risk associated with the release of asbestos (cancers, fibrosis). However, labour protection regulations must be carefully applied for individuals working on site cleanup operations. The water monitoring system allows any alteration in raw water quality and the water distributed in the hours following the catastrophe to be detected. The occasional overshoot of quality limit values for NH4+, NO3- and NO2- do not represent a health risk for consumers. The risks associated with soil contamination (soil thrown from the crater), both direct and indirect (food) have been disregarded. Psychological traumas are also registered: more than 8,000 people consulted their general practitioner for acute post-traumatic stress in the weeks following the explosion. Five thousand people began a psychotropic treatment (anxiolytic, antidepressant, hypnotic). According to the experts, these numbers are underestimated as they only take into account the individuals who sought medical care. The explosion had a major impact on psychological problems (depression, anxiety…). In addition, two studies conducted jointly with the French National Educational Service show that one year after the accident, one out of seven students still displays clear signs of post-traumatic stress. Continued monitoring of the medium and long-term health effects will be conducted via various elements of the epidemiological system: a cross-section study (a descriptive epidemiological study at time t) concerning approximately 50,000 salaried employees of the greater Toulouse community and 5,000 rescue personnel, on the one hand, and monitoring of a cohort of 5,000 salaried employees derived from this study (biological examinations), on the other hand. Finally, long-term analysis is planned to identify the causes of death (changes in the mortality rate) of the employees who agreed to give their addresses during the initial study. The information systems of the heath care structures which supplied the data are independent from one another and the existing databases cannot be interconnected when they exist. A person may be recorded in several of these systems without it being possible to detect the error and may be counted more than once. Also, the results do not allow precise quantitative estimates to be made regarding the overall number of different troubles observed. In addition to the physical and psychological traumas suffered by the population of Toulouse, there are significant social disturbances notably linked to the destruction and damage to homes, community equipment, buildings, technical unemployment, and to the loss of work… Associations and a collective have been organised to combat industrial hazards and to defend the interests of the populations concerned. ECONOMIC extensive property damage and production losses for the plant operator, neighbouring plants, retails and individuals, cost of clean-up and rehabilitation measures of the area (total cost estimated above 2 billions euros).Nearly 1,300 companies, representing approximately 20,000 employees, claimed losse. The shock wave and various projectiles damaged 82 schools, 19 middle schools and 15 high schools (36,000 students), as well as 4 establishments of higher education and 3 university dormitories. In front of the factory, a depot containing roughly one hundred busses was destroyed (30,5 M€) and numerous other store were damaged. A household appliance store located 320 m from the explosion's epicentre, as well as a vehicle maintenance facility at 380 m, collapsed also claiming victims. A total of 25,550 homes were damaged to various degrees, 11,180 of which were seriously damaged. More than one thousand homes were completely destroyed and more than 1,200 had to be relocated immediately. ","Immediate firefighting and rescue measures: The local authorities and several governmental departments activated emergency centres, the municipality set up a support centre for the population and the operator installed a crisis centre within the establishment. The PPI (special administrative accident response plan) and the plant’s emergency plan were put into action; reinforcements were requested to assist the departmental firemen, the civil protection mobilised a chemical hazard evaluation cell and technological catastrophe specialists. During the first 6 days,1,430 people were thus mobilised, including 460 firemen from the region, 620 firemen from other districts and 350 military personnel of the UIISC (civil security units). Roughly fifty doctors, 32 nurses or health care practitioners and more than 80 ambulance drivers were also mobilised. The monitoring of access routes, looting protection and guarding required 500 to 600 policemen and 13 companies of special CRS (riot control) policemen rotating between September 21 to October 3, 2001. Crisis management operations also mobilised 350 police officers plus 80 belonging to a mobile squad; primarily for traffic control, reinforcement and sanitary convoys. Considering the extent of the collateral damage and the inherent risks, numerous buildings and schools were evacuated. A security perimeter was set up in a radius of 500 m around the site. Thoroughfares around the site were closed. Traffic on the freeway, the southern ring road, the A62 and A64 motorways, the RN 20 highway, the metro, the railway station and Blagnac airport were interrupted. The numerous injured are admitted to local hospitals. The population was ordered to remain confined as a precautionary measure and masks were distributed around the site. In late morning, the Prefecture announced that the toxic risk was under control and that all danger of atmospheric pollution had been dismissed. The precautionary confinement order was lifted around 4.00 pm, and rail and air traffic was reestablished. Nevertheless, the population was asked not to consume the tap water. The pollution of the Garonne was also brought under control.The PPI was lifted September 28, 1.00 pm.
Securing of the site: At the request of the classified facilities inspectorate and according to an emergency procedure, on September 21, 2001 the Préfet issued an order suspending the activity of 6 companies operating within the chemical zone (AZF, SNPE, TOLOCHIMIE, ISOCHEM, AIR LIQUIDE and RAISIO) requiring them to secure their sites. One company, SOFERTI in Fenouillet, which recycles off-spec products coming from the storage facility that exploded, was also the subject of an emergency prefectoral order requesting it to secure its chemical substances; inerting operations were set up for this purpose. The crisis centre of the inspectorate remained active for 3 weeks after the accident in order to ensure that the various sites were secure.The securing of AZF site included several delicate operations: recovery and removal of stocks of ammonium nitrate in hot solution, industrial nitrates buried near the crater, liquefied ammonia, nitric acid… Expert evaluation and validation of the procedures were requested prior to certain operations. During the drainage of a liquefied ammonia storage tank, an uncontrolled release of approximately 9 tons of ammoniated solution resulted in pollution of the Garonne and fish mortality. It took several months to secure the AZF site and the other plants concerned, which namely involved the evacuation of dangerous substances. At the request of the Préfet, the corresponding operations were carried out by the operators under the control of the inspectorate. In this manner, according to the latter’s estimates and for the AZF plant alone, 4,000 tons of agricultural nitrates (fertilizer) and 800 tons of industrial nitrates buried under the gravel and rubble of buildings destroyed by the explosion, were to be cleared out and removed in the 4 months following the explosion. SNPE, ISOCHEM and TOLOCHIMIE were required to conduct an audit of the property damage and conduct analysis of the safety conditions. Based on a proposal by the inspectorate, the Préfet also required that a third-party expert evaluation be conducted, as defined in article 3-6 of the order dated 09/21/77. In addition to this,150 agricultural or industrial ammonium nitrate storage installations are monitored throughout France
Remedial :The remediation of the site led by the operator aimed essentially at reducing the concentrations of hydrocarbons, lead, arsenic and mercury in soil. In July 2006, after two years of work, more than 750,000 cubic meters of earth had been excavated, nearly 90% of the contaminated earth and concrete had been depolluted through on-site washing and heat treatment at 850 ° C. Depollution work is completed in early 2008. The operator estimates the cost of clean up measures at 100 million Euros .In autumn 2006, the construction of a cancerology center is announced on the site of the former AZF plant. The center will ultimately house 4,000 people, mostly researchers, on a campus of 220 ha. The Pierre Potier research Institute is inaugurated in late 2009, joined in 2010 by pharmaceutical companies. Finally, the University Hospital of Cancer, whose construction began in late 2009, opened in 2013.
","An inquiry by the Parliamentary Commission was opened October 24, 2001 relative to the safety of industrial installations and research centres, and relative to the protection of persons and the environment in the case of a major industrial accident. As of January 29, 2002, this commission had formulated 90 proposals along six major themes: reducing the risk at the source, the human factor notably with the employees playing a role in the prevention of accidents, the implementation of greater openness and pluralistic expertise with regard to disasters, urban planning questions, the adaptation of judicial procedures and the compensation of the victims of industrial catastrophes.
Within a few months, the French public authorities undertook different reflective thinking and actions: In the field of prevention, in order to: -Broaden the field of application of the SEVESO 2 directive by lowering the ammonium nitrate threshold, - Limit the risk presented by ammonium nitrate-based fertilizers by adapting their technical specifications to make them intrinsically less explosive, - Improve the prevention of major accident risks in ports and railroad yards, - Ensure the continuity of the security between fixed installations and the transport of dangerous substances, - Reinforce the exchanges between member States relative to the hazards associated with ammonium nitrates (fertilizer and industrial nitrates), - Reinforce the exchanges between member States relative to the cohabitation of activities at risk with other economic activities, residential housing and thoroughfares, - Harmonise the risk evaluation methods between France and the member States, - Access to improved harmonisation of methods and inspection means of establishments at risk by the public authorities, - Reinforce cooperation between research and expert assessment organisations in the European Union, - Re-examine the safety conditions of high-level SEVESO facilities,
O In the field of inspection, in order to:- Reinforce significantly the staff of the inspectorate - Reinforce the inspectorate through technical support for the examination of danger studies, - Check the fertilizer storage and ammonium nitrate storage facilities governed by the environmental legislation. O In the field of openness and information to: - Create more than 200 experimental local information and joint action committees (circular of July 12, 2002), - Publish (via Internet) the new operating authorisation orders accompanied with the inspection reports. The scenario of detonation had not been selected in the risk analysis of the plant either by the operator, the inspectorate or by third experts, because the existing feedback led to consider as unlikely the detonation of ammonium nitrate when compliant with manufacturing standarThis disaster clearly shows that the contingency plans must consider a series of scenarios of the type, severity and kinetics representative of possible accidents even if their probability is considered extremely low. The method for evaluating the risk proved to be insufficient. The danger study must consider the danger potential of installations, examine possible scenarios and their consequences including the most dramatic or improbable, estimate probabilities and characterize the modes of occurrence. Reducing risks at the source must aim at reducing the potential for danger, the probability of accidents occurring and limiting the consequences through appropriate organisational and technical systems. The legal system did not enable sufficient control in terms of urban planning, particularly for the existing industrial sites whose surrounding area had already been urbanised."

The reactor was depressurized and its contents transferred to another (empty) vessel and pressurized again.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:After every reaction cycle, the man-hole of the polymerizayion reactor had to be removed in order to allow the internal cleaning of the vessel. By mistake, the man-hole of a polymerization reactor in operation was opened for cleaning. This resulted in a leakage within the process building of the contents of the reactor (vinylchloride, water and polyvinylchloride) over a period of about 35 minutes because the gasket was damaged and therefore the sealing of the vessel was not possible. Since the sealing of the man-hole was not possible being the gasket damaged, the alarm was sounded in the plant and it was evacuated. The reactor was depressurized and its contents transferred to another (empty) vessel and pressurized again. Vinylchloride concentrations within the building were measured by the company to exclude the formation of an explosive cloud.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The opening of the man-hole of a reactor was attempted while the reactor was in operation (at about 8 bar), resulting in the release of the vessel contents. As the sealing of the man-hole was not possible (being the gasket damaged), the reactor's contents was released within the process building until transfer to another (empty) vessel was carried out.CAUSES:The accident was caused by an operator error during cleaning operations of the polymerization reactor but, however, the sealing of the reactor was not possible because the gasket was damaged. The underlying causes that led to the accident were inadequate operation procedures (with particular reference to the reactor's cleaning) and insufficient inspection of the gasket of the vessel.","OTHER:No material losses occurred except the substances released during the accident.People - Remarks: No people were injured during the accident.Ecological harm - Remarks: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms.Disruption of community life: Even if measurements of the vinylchloride concentrations in the nearby residential area were carried out by the company (values measured up to 1.9 mg/m3), in the Original Report there is no evidence of significant effects outside the establishment.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Since the sealing of the man-hole was not possible being the gasket damaged, the alarm was sounded in the plant and it was evacuated.

At a Seveso-classified chemical factory specialising in silicones, a forklift driver was moving a pallet containing 200&nbsp;l barrels of highly flammable silicone oils (silozanes) in a 2,500&nbsp;m² logistics warehouse. The fork accidentally pierced one of the barrels shortly before midday. He placed the affected pallet onto a mobile containment device taken from the adjacent storage unit before leaving the warehouse. The leaking product ignited on a hot point caused by friction of the (non‑ATEX) forklift’s metal forks against the ground. The worker grabbed a nearby powder-based fire extinguisher and tried to bring the fire under control. However it spread rapidly and killed him.",The leaking product ignited on a hot point caused by friction of the (non-ATEX) forklift’s metal forks against the ground.,"The forklift driver who had been moving the pallet with the damaged barrel died.
A large plume of black smoke rose from the warehouse and could be seen from far away. Residents of a nearby neighbourhood overlooking the site gathered in a park to observe the accident.
A slightly injured in-house firefighter was taken to hospital, as was an employee who passed out due to the heat. The fire destroyed 600 m&sup2; of the warehouse and burned 60 tonnes of the 230 tonnes of finished product. The factory was shut down for a week. The 900 m&sup3; of water used to extinguish the fire were stored in a containment tank before treatment or treated by skimming into a settlement tank.","The fire detection system alerted the guard post at 11.55 a.m. and the guards notified the unit’s firefighters. The firefighters arrived on the scene in less than 5 minutes and fought the fire with two foam trucks. Given the intensity of the fire, the operator launched the internal emergency plan at 12.10 p.m. The 750 employees were told to stay indoors. The emergency services arrived at 12.20 p.m. with 50 engines and around 100 firefighters.
The intensity of the fire and the urban location justified launching the external emergency plan.
As the site was situated beside a motorway in a built-up area, the prefect declared the external emergency plan at 1.10 p.m. Primary schools in the three nearby municipalities were ordered to keep children indoors for 1 hour. The motorway and its access roads were closed, causing numerous tailbacks. The fire was brought under control at 1.50 p.m. following a massive attack with foam monitors. The external emergency plan was lifted at 2.25 p.m. and the motorway access roads reopened.",The intensity of the fire and its location in a built-up area justified launching the external emergency plan: the smoke visible in the Lyon urban area significantly disrupted road traffic.

393,1239,Major Accident,Chemical installations - other fine chemicals,Explosion of tank containing waste water from batch production plant and subsequent fire,2020-05-15 10:20:00,2020-05-15 17:00:00,"The accident occurred around 10:15/10:30 (it was raining at the time the event occurred), when a fire broke out in the area of tanks TK 2.1 and TK 2.2 at a plant producing light stabilisers for the cosmetics market, which was in operation at the time of the event. The accident occurred during modification works, carried out by an external firm (mechanical and electrical/instrumentation maintenance assistance), which was connecting tank TK 2.2 to the waste water network. For this work, a regular work permit and a hot work licence were issued, the latter having been issued following preliminary checks for the safe preparation of the area, in accordance with the applicable safety management system (SMS) procedure. By 9:30, the external workers had cut the pipe that was being worked on using an angle grinder and were preparing to place the new pipe, as planned, after having constructed the fitting where the pipe was to be attached. The event occurred when the previously cut pipe was being sealed, while an electric arc welder was in use. The external workers involved (two operators, with appropriate PPE) were on a work platform set up to ensure the safety of the activities in question, approximately 8-10 m above ground level. This work platform was approximately 5 m from the outer perimeter of tank TK 2.2. The way the event developed resulted in an internal domino (cascade) effect which affected all plants at the establishment.","The accident occurred as a result of modification works that were being carried out by a third company, which was modifying a connection between the wastewater network and tank TK 2.2. The use of an electric arc welder when sealing the previously cut pipe caused the flammable mixture within the tank (waste water vapour) to ignite. Furthermore, according to statements from the plant operators, the tank on which the line modification work was to be carried out (TK 2.2) was blanketed with nitrogen pumped in through the same pipe that was cut and then welded, at approx. 2.5 bar. It is possible that, precisely as a result of cutting the pipe, the inert nitrogen atmosphere was lost due to the broken connection.","The fire affected all production areas, directly and by heat radiation, as well as part of the laboratory building, the control room adjacent to the production units and the cooling tower area.No pollutants were found in the waters of the Venetian Lagoon, although traces were found in the industrial canals.The following property was affected: all of the establishment&rsquo;s plants, which were totally destroyed and are now no longer usable (apart from 15&nbsp;metal tanks). The costs amount to: EUR&nbsp;35,000,000 (material losses); EUR&nbsp;14,000,000 (response, clean-up, restoration costs).","At the time of the event (approx. 10:20), the Internal Emergency Plan (IEP) was activated by the shift emergency coordinator (shift attendant) and external emergency services were alerted in the form of a call to the local station of the Venice fire brigade (VVF). The External Emergency Plan (EEP) was then activated by the Venice Prefect’s Office, following notification from the fire brigade. Following intervention by the emergency services, the fire was brought under control at approx. 14:00, and the emergency was declared over at approx. 17:00. The fire brigade then checked the still-active pockets of fire and made the plants safe by: monitoring (using a thermal camera) and cooling one reactor; intervening on one tank on-off valve. The operator, together with the fire brigade, then surveyed the site and the effects of the event in order to begin work to make the site safe, which lasted for 1 month (until all the tanks containing hazardous substances present at the establishment were completely emptied). After the event, the following emergency and environmental operations to make them safe were carried out: a contract was concluded with a company specialising in making sites environmentally safe, resulting in a plan being issued; all tanks were completely emptied and the site was made safe by removing all hazardous substances present at the establishment; the environmental status was continuously monitored during decommissioning activities (hazardous substances possibly present in the air); cleaning of underground utilities, remediation and refurbishment of collection and sewage systems.","
Always conduct a risk analysis on all types of modifications in accordance with the appropriate SMS procedure for management of changes (preliminary risks, risks during implementation and risks during operation), resulting in the identification of preventive and protective measures to be implemented, as well as the related training activities for the staff involved.
Always keep systems subject to modification works under isolated and inert conditions to prevent the environmental conditions from changing, which could lead to the formation of potentially flammable and/or explosive atmospheres.
The work permit process must always pay attention to: checks prior to and/or during the performance of the activities, supervision by the persons responsible and formalisation.
Follow the procedures for the correct positioning of stores of hazardous substances and mixtures on the forecourt (e.g. tanks, drums, IBCs, etc.), including related fire protection systems and equipment, as a result of an appropriate risk analysis.
During inspections by the competent authorities, pay attention to the link between risk analysis and management of changes, including those of a temporary nature, in the fine chemicals sector (batch reactions).
Carry out continuous analysis of the operational experience gained from accidents, near misses and anomalies through the specific SMS procedures, and record in the relevant documentation the causes identified, the substances involved, how the incident happened, how the emergency was managed and the corrective actions implemented, instead of simply describing the events.

394,540,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Toxic release (blast furnace gas) from blast furnace off-gas system via ruptured seal on valve,1999-08-09 11:30:00,1999-08-09 15:45:00,"Release of toxic gas (blast furnace gas) from blast furnace off-gas system via ruptured seal on valve.  Reportable due to quantity released: 750000 cubic metres of gas (weight approx 94 tonnes,c. 50% of top tier quantity)At approximately 11.30 am on Monday 9 August 1999 the energy distribution control (EDC) contacted Redcar blast furnace (RBF) control room and reported a dip in gas make from the furnace.&nbsp; No alarms were reported from RBF and the gas make appeared to returnto normal.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards however carbon monoxide alarms went off in the power station (range of CO levels, 40-80 ppm on turbine floor) and it was noticed that the gas make had not returned to its normal level.&nbsp; A check was made of the gas line to determine the source of the gas leak.&nbsp; It was reported that the leak was from the ERT inlet valve and the ERT was tripped.&nbsp; When it came off line the full flow of the blast furnace gas was directed down the clean gas main.&nbsp; In fact the leak was from the demister plate valve, this increased the leak and also, because of the pressure build up in the system caused a pressure sensor situated upstream of the demister plate vAlve to trip at 170mbarg so opening flare stack leg A and allowing the contents of the gas holder to escape to the flare stack.&nbsp; The flare stack was not lit (see below) and the gas was released unflared.&nbsp; Levels of carbon monoxide of 100ppm were recorded around the ramp at no 1 slag pit.&nbsp; At around the time that the ERT was tripped it was noticed that the leak was actually from the demister plate valve and blowing across the top of the ERT building then towards the bag filter house and towards the power station.&nbsp; Part of the cast-house floor of the blast furnace were within the path of the gas.&nbsp; Personnel were evacuated from the cast-house floor of the furnace however casting was in progress and some personnel were required to complete the cast before the plant could be made safe.&nbsp; These personnel were given Draeger comopac carbon monoxide monitors and returned to the casthouse to complete the cast.&nbsp; In the meantime the furnace was taken off blast to reduce the flow of gas.&nbsp; It was reported that the highest levels of gas (200ppm) were found on the rocker bay below the cast house floor.&nbsp; During the release the alarms in the ERT building were set off by carbon monoxide, these are set to go off at 2000ppm.&nbsp; The blast furnace was brought off-blast, an operation which took some time and necessitated the opening of the bleeder valves at the top of the furnace which introduced another release source for the gas during the incident.&nbsp; The u-seal between the blast furnace and the clean gas main was put into place at around 12:20 and the incident declared closed at 13:14 although the blast furnace had not been completely brought off blast at this time.&nbsp; Theexact amount of gas released during the incident is unknown although a British Steel calculation estimates that 130 tonnes were lost through the demister plate valve and 77 tonnes from the gasholder unflared through the flare stack (the gas holder was estimated to be 40% full at the time of the incident).&nbsp; Unusual weather conditions for August, North-easterly wind and heavy rain.&nbsp; Prevailing wind Westerly hence gas cloud moved towards plant instead of off-site.","Plate valve used for isolation of gas main during shutdowns and normally kept in open position closed due to electrical short-circuit allowing hydraulic operation of the valve.  Valve did not fully close and seal blown off by closing into full gas flow, leak occurred through annulus of valve.  System of work in place where hydraulics isolated and locked off when valve in open position had not been followed and electrical fault led to valve closing.  Blast furnace shut down but residual pressure in gas holder led to continuation of release, some gas flared but c.750,000 cubic metres lost via valve.The site is a new
entrant COMAH top-tier site and little previous work has been done to
evaluate the managemnet system in place to prevent and mitigate
potential major accidents. The assessments above are from information
received during the investigation into the release. These aspects will
be considered in more detail during inspection as part of the
inspection plan. No entry written.The investigation involved two main areas of interest, the demister
plate valve itself and the flare system, these are dealt with
separately below.&nbsp; 
a)&nbsp; Initial investigations showed that the reason the demister plate
valve had shut was because of an electrical short circuit between
relays 28767 the local emergency stop and 28777 the local closed push
button relay in the demister plate valve location box.&nbsp; This box had
been designed to IP65 however a compression joint in one of the top
glands had been incorrectly fitted so that part of the steel wire
armouring of the cable was above the level of the seal hence water
ingress was possible.&nbsp; This short in itself however should not have
been sufficient to cause the closure of the plate valve as British
Steel procedures required physical isolations to be fitted to the
electrical input to the local box together with the electrical and
manual operation of the plate valve clamps situated in the hydraulic
shed below the plate valve.&nbsp; None of these three isolations&nbsp; were
fitted at the time of the incident.&nbsp; There are a number of procedures
on TEMS (Total Engineering Management System) which relate to
operations on the demister plate valve.&nbsp; Of these, Job Safety Procedure
JFP607 refers to operation of the plate valve during shutdowns and
includes details on both closing and opening the valve.&nbsp; The procedure
details the need to isolate the valve electrical and hydraulic systems
to prevent unauthorised valve operations.&nbsp; The isolations referred to
in JFP607 for the valve when in the open position are detailed in
isolation no.IF4494,these are; the gas plant isolation valve hydraulic
house below the valve at the north end of the demister); and the gas
plant isolation valve electric actuator on the platform adjacent to the
goggle valve actuator in the gas main.&nbsp; When the valve is in the closed
position there is an additional electrical isolation in the switch
house.&nbsp; The isolations are made by way of isolocks on the local
isolators which are secured by an EBI lock.&nbsp; There is a master key
which fits all EBI locks, this is kept in a key cabinet in the RBF
control room and issued via a signing out book.&nbsp; The key to the key
cabinet is kept to the side of the communications panel in the control
room and is easily accessible.&nbsp; The last shutdown which required
closing of the demister plate valve was carried out at the end of
June.&nbsp; There are no records in the key signing out book between 30 June
and 9 August when, following the release the isolocks and EBI locks
were observed to be lying on the windowsill in the hydraulic house
below the valve at the north end of the demister.&nbsp; In 1996 and 1997 a
quality improvement programme (QIP) was initiated which looked at all
aspects of operation of the plate and goggle valves in the clean gas
main.&nbsp; The minutes of the meetings are attached.&nbsp; Issues raised during
the QIP included the identification of the valves (as problems had been
encountered where personnel meant different valves when that used a
particular number) and safe operation of the valves.&nbsp; Concern was
expressed about the level of isolation of plate valves as the manual
hydraulic override was not isolated.&nbsp; A was raised in which it was
stated that the actuation of a plate valve during furnace operation
could result in a large release of gas and recommended the isolation of
the manual hydraulic clamp release on the plate valves.&nbsp; Following the
plate valve QIP a committee was set up to look at the implications of
COMAH for the blast furnace.&nbsp; During a meeting on 23rd July 1997 a list
of the top ten scenarios for major accidents occurring on RBF were
presented, failed operation of plate valve PIV7 was included on this
list.&nbsp; In addition to the procedures for safe operation of the plate
valve, TEMS holds routines for the inspection of plate valves by both
electrical and mechanical inspectors.&nbsp; There are separate electrical
and mechanical routines for all plate valves, some examples are
attached.&nbsp; Those for electrical inspections are typically on a two to
four week frequency and include a reference to checking that isolations
are in place.&nbsp; In the case of PIV7 however the reference to check that
the isolation was in place was added after the incident on 9th August
so prior to the incident there was no requirement for electrical
inspectors to carry out checks that the isolations were in place on
either the electrical junction box adjacent to the demister plate valve
or in the hydraulic house despite there being requirements to check
these isolations on other plate valves.&nbsp; The schedules for mechanical
inspections for the plate valves are similar to those for the
electrical inspections and again there are no instructions on the job
for PIV7 to check isolations are in place whereas these are present on
some of the job schedules for other plate valves.&nbsp; Two routine
electrical inspections of the plate valve were carried out between the
shutdown at the end June and the gas release but TEMS contains no
comments as to the presence or otherwise of the isolations at these
inspections.&nbsp; 
b) Originally it was thought that the flare had ignited and the gas
from the gas-holder had been flared, it soon became apparent however
that this was not the case and that raw gas was released from the flare
stack during the incident.&nbsp; Operation of the flare stack can be
initiated manually or by the tripping of one or more of five pressure
switches situated as shown in the attached diagram.&nbsp; Switches 1 and 2
are set to trip at 173mbar and open flare leg A, switch 3 is set at
80mbar and opens legs A, switch 4 is set at 85mbar and opens leg B and
switch 5 is set at 95mbar and opens leg C.&nbsp; In addition there is a
pressure transmitter which ties in with the gas holder level system and
acts to open leg C.&nbsp; The flare is not normally lit but lights by means
of an air and propane ignition system when a leg opens.&nbsp; During the
incident on 9th August, pressure switch 2 tripped due to a build up of
blast furnace gas around the demister plate valve and so it was leg A
which opened.&nbsp; At the time of the incident the flare was in an alarm
mode and so there was no ignition when the flare was opened.&nbsp; The flare
had been in alarm since at least 1st August (there were no records
available prior to this date but no action had been taken to reset the
flare which was done by manually operating a button at the base of the
flare stack.&nbsp; Visual display of the alarm is given in the control room
at RBF, when the alarm comes in there is an audible alarm and a
flashing light however once accepted the audible is canceled and the
light remains on but does not flash.&nbsp; It is thought that the contents
of the gas holder were lost through the flare in around 7 minutes.&nbsp;
During the investigation into the failure of the flare system to ignite
during the incident it was discovered that in fact none of the flare
legs was operable and consideration was given to the service of a COMAH
Prohibition Notice however action to restore temporary propane
suppllies to the flare legs brought the flare back into use until
repairs were carried out.

The violent reaction between water and liquid titanium tetrachloride caused the tank to rip open in the welding seam. Titanium tetrachloride and the reaction products (titanium dioxide [TiO2], titanium dichloride oxide [TiOCl2] and hydrogen chloride [HCl]) were released. Further emission of the substances occurred as air replaced the vapours in the tank. Traffic was deviated and the population alerted.","CAUSES:
The accident was caused by corrosion of U-tube of the titanium tetrachloride condensator in the cooling water circuit. It was caused by the cleaning of the U-tube in the cooling water circuit with chemicals.

The steel plant is supplied with electricity by three 150-MVA transformers at the power station, and they transform 225 kV into 63 kV. The units are served by two electricity supply stations. Both stations have two transformers for converting 63 kV to 20 kV.
As a blast furnace that had been idle for the purpose of maintenance was being restarted, one of the 225KV-63KV transformers started overheating. The operator decided to couple it with the third back-up transformer in order to disconnect the overheating transformer. That is the procedure. During this operation, a failure of the 63-kV output circuit breaker cut the electricity supply to the steel plant. This power cut caused the coke oven gas extractors to shut down and gases to be emitted into the atmosphere through exhaust pipes. These gases contain CO, H2S, CH4 and other VOCs such as benzene.","As a blast furnace that had been idle for the purpose of maintenance was being restarted, one of the 225KV-63KV transformers started overheating.

&nbsp;","This power cut caused the coke oven gas extractors to shut down and gases to be emitted into the atmosphere through exhaust pipes. These gases contain CO, H2S, CH4 and other VOCs such as benzene. It is estimated that 66 t of CH4, 6 t of benzene and 31 t of CO were released.
&nbsp;","The crisis unit was operational at 2.00 a.m. The internal emergency plan was launched at 2.26 a.m. Hundred people were confined indoors. An air-monitoring network was set up. The confinement was lifted at 4.30 a.m. At 5.10 a.m. power was restored to one of the two main transformers, making it possible to supply electricity to 50% of the coke oven, including the two gas extractors. At 6.07 a.m. the exhaust pipes of the coke oven were shut. The site reverted to using the third transformer, because the circuit breaker of the second transformer was malfunctioning. The internal emergency plan was lifted at 6.30 a.m.
&nbsp;","Following this incident, &nbsp;the inspection authorities for classified facilities proposed that the electric installations be inspected by a third-party company, with special attention paid to the reliability of the equipment.

404,924,Major Accident,Other activity (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of 1 ton of 40% HF-solution from IBC,2010-01-07 08:45:00,2010-01-07 22:00:00,"In the morning of januari 7th 2010, the mixing of several products was started in order to produce a detergent. The mixing was done in a 9000 litre tank in which a total amount of 8000 litres of detergent is produced. At the point where the tank contained 6000 litres of mixed products, 2 tons of a 40 percent HF-solution needed to be added. This is done by successively adding the content of 2 plastic IBC's containing each 1 ton of the 40 percent HF-solution. An IBC is transported with a small stacker to the vicinity of the tank, prepared for emptying (remove the safety button of the tap at the bottom and screw open -but not remove- the cap of the filling hole at the top), then lifted and emptied.After the lifting of the first IBC, the stacker was driven forward only about half a meter in order to put the tap of the IBC above the opening on top of the mixing-tank. After this movement, the stacker and the IBC leaned over and fell. The IBC fell off the stacker, hit a contractor employee, and landed on the ground where it's contend completely drained on the floor via the open filling hole.","By driving forward the stacker with the IBC in a high position, the stacker became unbalanced. There were different main causes for this unbalance, which led together to the tipping over: - The IBC was lifted too high related to its weight, outside the specified working range of the stacker (this risk wasn't known to the operators). So the stacker was not adequate for this job.- The floor wasn't completely flat and horizontal : there was a small slope to a drain. The maximum height difference between the front wheels of the stacker caused by this slope was about 1 cm.- The operator just stepped off the platform of the stacker. By this action, the centre of gravity of the loaded stacker moved slightly forward.- The IBC wasn't filled to the top. 1 ton of HF-solution is less than 1000 litres. So the liquid was able to move inside the IBC, which effects the position of the centre of gravity of the IBC.At the moment of the accident, there was no risk assessment made by the company regarding to the procedure of filling the tank. Regarding to the handling of HF, there was a written instruction with some points of attention, but it didn't describe the filling activities.There is a training program for stacker operators in the company, which includes a specialised and certified training for fork-lift drivers. The operator involved in the accident only worked at the company for 10 months. At the time of the accident, he didn't pass through the whole training program, and he wasn't a certified fork-lift driver yet. Although, he was allowed to work with the stacker, because in the past he had a similar job.","A contractor employee, installing a new apparatus in the vicinity of the mixing tank, was hit at the head by an edge of the falling IBC. By this impact he was thrown to the floor, where the fallen IBC was draining.&nbsp; The operator responded promptly by moving the victim away from the leaking liquid pool. During this intervention, the victim made a little contact at his legs with the HF-solution. He was treated immediatly with calcium gluconate gel.Another operator wanted to inform the people in the office about the accident. Without reflecting about the best way to do this, he took the shortest way and ran through the liquid pool. The soles of his shoes were damaged by the HF and his feet also needed a treatment with calcium gluconate.","The 2 victims were removed to a hospital. 1 victim left the hospital on the same day.The whole building, providing accommodation to 2 different companies, needed to be evacuated until the next morning.​As the production hall couldn't be entered without wearing a gas suit, 7 different municipal fire brigades were asked to send their firemen with gas suits. Those firemen cleaned up the production hall until 9 o'clock pm. The small amounts of HF that were left, were neutralised. An external crisis centre was installed 30 meters away from the production hall.",- No more lifting of IBC's with this type of stacker.- Changes in the design of the installation: IBC's are emptied using a pump and fixed pipework.- More consistent training of the operators- No more contractor employees allowed when hydrogen fluoride is being handled.- The contractor employee didn't receive any (safety) instructions from the company before entering the production hall. He was only told where to find the sanitary facilities.

These smouldering nests were fed to vibrating sieves and split up by the mechanical movement. The hot core was exposed.These hot cores ignited the dust/air mixture in the sieves and the consequent blast wave initiated secondary explosions and fires in the adjoining parts of the installation.The smouldering fire found in the storage of recycled material was also caused by the event.",Material damages approximately 350.000 DM - 175.000 EURO,not given,"1.

407,911,Major Accident,Production of pharmaceuticals,EXPLOSION IN A WASTEWATER TREATMENT UNIT AT A PHARMACEUTICAL FACTORY,2010-06-10 12:00:00,2010-06-10 15:52:00,"The accident took place during hot work on the supply line to Tank TKX which contained spent stripped fermentation broth (SFB) from the production of antibiotics. This work was being carried out by a subcontract firm as part of a temporary modification to the wastewater treatment unit. There was a confined explosion of gas inside the tank which led to the roof of the tank being projected approximately 20 metres; the explosion killed one subcontractor and injured four other workers (three subcontractors and one company employee), all of whom were working on the modification. The SFB supply line had been emptied of wastewater coming from the distillery unit. The air vent of the tank, located on the roof of the tank, had been open as usual. The tank was approximately 50% full. Five workers were carrying out the work, four from the external firm and one from the company itself. The external workers had disconnected the SFB line by removing the shut-off valve on the entry duct on the roof of Tank TKX without closing it with the port's blind flange. One worker was standing on the roof of the tank near the open flange; the others were on the walkway giving access to the roof of the tank. They were beginning to cut the existing tube using a disc saw; sparks most likely produced by contact between the disc and the tubing ignited the explosive atmosphere which, unknown to them, had collected inside the tank. There was a confined vapour explosion (CVE) inside the tank which projected the tank roof approximately 20 metres. The shock wave threw the worker standing on the roof onto that of the adjacent tank, killing him; pieces of the tank roof fell onto the other four workers standing on the walkway; the connected tubing was also thrown a great distance.","The direct cause of the accident was the presence of a mixture of highly inflammable gases inside the TKX tank, ignited by sparks caused by a cutting disc during temporary modification work. The gas came from the sediment at the bottom of the tank. The conditions inside the tank, i.e. the lack of oxygen, encouraged the formation of populations of anaerobic bacteria which initiated fermentation, thereby producing various highly inflammable gaseous compounds, such as hydrogen and methane, which are lighter than air. In addition, the presence of sulphates means that a series of other (sulphide) gases may be produced which are extremely inflammable and much heavier than air. A vent was present on the tank roof; this allowed only the circulation of the lighter-than-air gases. The anaerobic conditions which led to the formation of the gases were due to a modification to the tank undertaken around ten years previously; this closed the air vents on the tank base which were included in the original plans. During operations the sediment would accumulate on the base of the tank in large quantities and under anaerobic conditions. The area had been considered to be non-dangerous within the meaning of the ATEX Directive. The work had been decided on in order to carry out a temporary modification without, however, adequately assessing the risks. The internal hot work safety procedure (isolation, clean-up, use of an explosimeter) was not applied. The fact that the work was carried out when the tank was full meant that the ignition of inflammable gases was inevitable. Various estimates have been made regarding the exact chemical breakdown of the gas inside the tank, but analyses and laboratory simulations seem to confirm that sulphide gases in layers lower down the tank were the main components, along with hydrogen and methane from layers higher up the tank.","In human terms, the tank explosion caused the immediate death of a subcontract worker and injured four others (three subcontract workers and one company employee). The worker who died was standing on the tank roof holding the flanged end of the SFB supply line which was to be cut. The explosion took place as soon as the disc saw touched the pipe. The roof was torn off along the welding line and thrown into the air; after flying over the adjacent tank TKZ it fell to earth around 20 metres away. The worker was thrown from the roof of the tank onto that of tank TKZ, where his body was found. He had probably landed on his back, thereby hitting the back of his head against one of the roof's reinforcing beams (double-t iron beams arranged in a radial pattern on the roof). The four injured workers, who suffered first- and second-degree burns on various parts of the body, were thrown off the TKX walkway onto the nearby TKY tank and fell down the exit ladder; all were given first aid by the company medical service and then taken to Brindisi hospital where they were treated, with expected recovery times ranging from 40 to 200 days. The material damage has been estimated at EUR 1.8 million for equipment and production losses, and EUR 0.8 million to restore the area to use, a total of EUR 2.6 million.","The accident occurred at around 12 noon. The internal emergency procedures were activated within ten minutes. As there was no fire, some members of the emergency team treated the injured and transferred them to Brindisi hospital in the company ambulance. Other team members searched for the fourth worker who was carrying out the hot work; he was found dead. The pumps to the TKX tank were closed and the unit put in safety mode. A fire brigade team called to the site by people outside the plant arrived 15 minutes after the accident and carried out emergency operations. Half an hour after the accident the emergency medical services arrived, having been called in by the company employees. The medical services confirmed the death of the fourth subcontract worker. Three ambulances were present at the accident site. The fire brigade's special CBRN team also arrived half an hour after the accident in order to check for the possible presence of explosive atmospheres. The emergency was closed within approximately four hours when the emergency services returned to base.","The lack of aeration at the base of the equalisation tanks leads to anaerobic fermentation of accumulated residues with the production of various highly inflammable gases. Highly explosive mixtures can ignite at the slightest opportunity, particularly if hot work is carried out without taking the necessary precautions. Aeration of the tank base is vital for safety reasons and must not be done away with for any reason.
In the ATEX Directive (96/92/EC) plants with tanks containing spent broths are classified as being at risk of the creation of explosive atmospheres, and ATEX and safety procedures must therefore be used.
For modifications, even temporary ones, the risks must be analysed using appropriate methods, such as HAZOP. The risks of such work must also be analysed.
Employees and workers from subcontract firms must be informed about and trained in safety procedures, and more importantly the unit heads must have a culture of safety, i.e. the strict application of safety procedures.
Accidents of this kind may happen in future, also due to the expansion of biotechnology in different sectors. While many biotechnologies are malodorous, this unpleasant aspect cannot be eliminated at the cost of creating much more serious risks, as in this case.

408,621,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion caused by a runaway reaction in a section of high-boiling tars of a TDI department,2002-11-28 00:00:00,2002-11-28 00:00:00,"The overpressure&nbsp; caused by an unforeseen runaway reaction between&nbsp; chlorinated tars and TDI caused the explosion of Tank no. D 528/2 and a subsequent fire. The pressure wave&nbsp; and the carbon dioxide formed by the explosion of the second tank no. D 528/1 extinguished most fires which had developed.The accident occurred in a section of high-boiling tars of the TDI department TD5. In the department TD5 toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) is produced through the reaction of 2,4-toluendiamine (TDA) and phosgene.The reaction is performed in 3 successive steps with increasing temperature from approximately 80°C to 170°C, with decreasing pressure and hydrogen chloride acid as a by-product.In the section of high-boiling tars, described in the attached block-diagram (ref. Attachment 2), a part of TDI is recovered in a vacuum batch process from the mixture containing 50% TDI and 50%&nbsp; high-boiling tars, stored in tank D 522, which is equipped with a stirrer and water refrigerated coils.The TDI is recovered by evaporation in the concentrator D 525/1, equipped with a stirrer, steam heated coils and maintained at vacuum pressure.Concentrator D 525/1 is fed by the tanks D 528/1-2-3 acting also as compensation tanks. The TDI vapours are then condensed and the liquid then transferred for storage, the residual gas is sent through a separator and then suctioned by the 3stage vacuum units P 509/1-3. The concentrate present in D 525/1 is composed of 18-20% TDI and for the remaining part of high-boiling tars is diluted with toluene, mixed and transferred over a pump in tank D 541, where it is continuously stirred at a temperature of 115 - 120°C with the objective of obtaining a sufficiently fluid and stable mass to be sent into the incinerator B 502/2 for combustion.On 26/11/2002 at about 17:40 the shift assistant of&nbsp; department TD 4-5 shut down the stirrer P 507 of tank D 522 due to the excessive noise of the reduction gear of the motor caused by an insufficient lubrication (memo in the logbook).Following the shutting down of the stirrer P 705 the temperature in tank D 544 started to rise gradually and stabilised at 125°C according to the value recorded by the DCS (Distributed Control System) switchboard assistant. These values cannot be considered&nbsp; reliable due to the fact that the instrument T 5-258 was calibrated to measure temperatures up to 120°C. Tank D 522 receiving the high-boiling tars and the TDI from the evaporator D 521 operates at a maximum temperature of approximately 95°C in normal operating conditions.On 27/11/2002 at 7:30 hrs the feed to tank D 522 is reduced from 400 kg/h to 1900 kg/h maintaining the water circulation in the cooling coils of tank D 522 constant. The reduction of the feed charge reduced the temperature in tank D 522 to 65°C. At approximately 12:00 hrs on 27/11/2002 the temperature of tank D 522 rose again in connection with the increased load of the evaporator D 521, which went up from the previous 1700 kg/h to 7000 kg/h. For the remaining part of 27/11/2002 and until approximately 17:30 hrs on 28/11/2002, when the stirrer was started again, the DCS registered a temperature beyond the top of the measurement scale (above 120°C). At 4:00 hrs on 28/11/2002 the shift personnel registered a temperature rise in tanks D528/1-2-3 and on the work sheet the temperature marked for tanks D 528/1-2-3 were respectively 136-142 and 131°C. The operating temperature normally foreseen for the tanks is 105°C.The switchboard operator reported to the shift assistant an abnormal batch distillation, characterised by the rapidity of the same and the low amount of distilled product, the temperature of D 525/1 was 139°C instead of 105-110° expected at the beginning of the distillation.The operation manual did not indicate the measures to be adopted in case of high temperatures in D 522 and D 528/1-2-3.In the meantime, at 16:30 on 28/11/2002 tank 528/2 filled to 60% reached the temperature of 170°C.The design temperature of the equipment D528/1-2-3 is 150°C.At 18:00 hrs the temperature in tank D 528/2 reached 181°C and it was not possible to discharge tank D 528/2 because distillation was in progress in D25/1 and tank D541 feeding the incinerator B 502/2 was full and could not receive the high-boiling tars from D 525/1.Only at 18:35, when the distillation process in D 525/1 finished, could the discharge into D 541 be performed, only at this point did D 541 have the capacity to receive the content of D 525/1.At 18:50 valve XV 5316 was opened to start the discharge operation of tank 528/2 into tank D 525/1; in that point tank D 528/2, with a nominal capacity of 10m3, was 59.5% full and the temperature&nbsp; 220.7°C. The attempt to discharge tank D 528/2 did not succeed, due to the fact that the not homogenous product inside the tank contained solid matter which blocked the discharge of the tank. Inside the tank unwanted chemical reactions had been going on for hours with development of gas and increase of the temperature and viscosity of the reaction mass.Four external contractors approached the distillation unit D 525/1 to verify the conditions inside the unit through a visual inspection window installed on the dome cap. A dense white smoke inside the distillation unit did not allow the workers to look inside the equipment and the pipe connecting tank D 528/2 to the rupture disk was particularly hot. At 19:25 a second attempt to discharge the tank was made but failed, the temperature on the control panel indicated 220°C while there was no means to measure the pressure inside the vessel. At 19:30 the four external contractors were still in the plant verifying the hydraulic guard D 583 when a strong whistling was heard and white smoke leaking from the flanged coupling located on the delivery tube of the distillation unit D 525/1 was seen. Instinctively the four external contractors tried to escape but a strong explosion was heard, at 19:42 hrs tank D 528/2 exploded. The tank contained a mixture of TDI and TDI high-boiling tars. The pressure wave of the explosion made one escaping worker fall while all were hit and covered by a dense, warm, half solid substance with a high viscosity and a granular structure. After a few (dozen) seconds a fire developed.The explosion ignited a fire involving the terminal part (southern side) of the framework of the ""TDI high-boiling tars processing"" department. The fire was mainly fed by 20 tons of diathermic oil (Aerthem 320) and one ton of toluene due to the rupture of the corresponding pipes.The fire affected the second of the three TDI and high-boiling tars storage tanks, D 528/1 (85% full when the accident occurred), causing its mechanical failure and releasing the second explosion at approximately 20:25 hrs. The explosion of tank D 528/1 extinguished the main fire leaving only some residual secondary fires.","According to the information given by the operator and from the analysis of the plant data on the section involved in the accident, it is assumed that the accident was caused by an unwanted thermally activated condensation reaction between the high-boiling tars and TDI first in tank no. D522, which then developed in tank D 528/2 with the release of heat and carbon dioxide causing the mechanical explosion of tank D 528/1 due to overpressure.The principal causes assumed are the following:Interruption of the stirring movement in tank D 522Missing operative instructions concerning the management of abnormal conditions caused by high temperature in tanks D 522 and D 528 1/2/3Missing information on the risks involved in managing the abnormal process conditions relating to the specific caseMissing pressure measurement instruments in tanks D 528 1/2/3According to the information given by the operator and from the analysis of the plant data on the section involved in the accident, it is assumed that the accident was caused by an unwanted thermally activated condensation reaction between the high-boiling tars and TDI, activated first in tank no. D522 and then developed in tank D 528/2, with the release of heat and carbon dioxide causing the mechanical explosion of tank D 528/1 due to overpressure.The high temperatures and the prolonged residence time of the mass in D 528/2 (approximately 13 hours), supported the development of exothermic condensation reactions or reactions associated with the formation of carbon dioxide and a significant pressure increase.When the explosion occurred the internal temperature of tank D 528/2 was above 220°C and clearly the tank was in extreme overpressure conditions. When the event occurred the tank was filled to 60% of its design capacity of 10 m3.A study has been performed by the Dow, on the thermal stability of the substances involved in the accident and in particular on the results of the adiabatic calorimetric tests (ARC) performed on a tar sample collected immediately after the accident from tank D 522, with the goal of understanding the behaviour of the substances involved in the accident.The tests were made by heating a known quantity of material composed by high-boiling tars and TDI in an adiabatic thermal system and registering the temperature and pressure evolution over time. This test simulated the heating process of the product in D 528/2 involved in the explosion. The test results agree basically with the values registered by the DCS during the accident and demonstrated the development of two distinct reactions, one exothermic reaction and another one developing carbon dioxide.The rupture disk failed due to a plug formed of hardened foam of the ""boiling"" mass on the pipe connecting the tank with the rupture disk and the venting manifold.","ON-SITEThe event caused injuries to 4 workers and the partial destruction of the department.OFF-SITETests performed by the Water Magistracy of Venice on water samples taken from the lagoon in front of the TDI plant showed that polluting substances released by sewage drain SM15/3 were discharged in the lagoon through the general sewage drain SM15 of the installation, spreading in the aquatic environment modifying the chemical characteristics of the water in the lagoon up to 1 km from the establishment.People - Remarks:Personnel present on-site- When the event occurred there were 30 Dow employees and 6 external technicians for activities on the TD12 plant. Of these only 4 external contractors needed medical treatment as specified below.Composition of the emergency response teams: - The EniChem fire brigade intervened with a team of 12 persons;- The national fire brigade intervened with a team of 52 persons.Persons involved off-site.- The population was not involved in the accidental event.- The distance from the urban quarter C# Emiliani (population of 10,000 inhabitants) of Porto Marghera is&nbsp; approximately 2500 m.- The distance from the village of Malcontenta (population of 1,000 inhabitants) is&nbsp; approximately 1,1250mImmediate or subsequent fatalities: No fatalities were registeredHospitalised injuries: Nobody was hospitalisedInjuries not requiring hospitalisationThe 4 external workers who were performing controls in proximity of the plant equipment were involved in the accident but were only partially exposed to the effects of the explosion of tank D 528/2. All received first medical treatment at the infirmary of the petrochemical establishment and then at the emergency department of the hospital Umberto I in Mestre.The medical reports of the emergency department contain following diagnosis:Worker No. 1: 3 days of incapacity to work(from 28/11/02 to 02/12/02), due to pharyngeal hyperaemia and facial erythema.Worker No. 2: 31 days of incapacity to work(from 28/11/02 to 30/12/02), due to I and II degree burns on the scalp.Worker No. 3: 31 days of&nbsp; incapacity to work(from 28/11/02 to 30/12/02), due to the consequences of exposure to toxic industrial substances.Worker No. 4: 53 days of incapacity to work (from 28/11/02 to 21/01/03), due to the after effects of a trauma caused by a contusion associated with a distortion of the right knee and state of reactive anxiety.Hospitalised persons: There were no hospitalised injuries&nbsp; (the Italian says non-hospitalised injuries)Persons put under health monitoring programs: There have been no persons put under health monitoring programs consequent to the accidental vent occurred.Ecological Harm - Remarks:Consequent to the accident that occurred on 28/11/02 the personnel of the Antipollution department of the Water Magistracy of Venice (SAMA) performed a series of controls on the drains of the site. Considering the position in which the accident occurred, it was considered appropriate to concentrate on the community sewage drain SM15. During the days following the accident controls were made not only on sewage drain SM15 but also on the section drain SM15/3 directly connected to the TDI production department and on the drain SM15/22 of the central biological sewage treatment plant of the installation, which might have suffered consequences from the event.Both drains form the general drain SM15. Moreover, on 04/12/2002 all drains of the installation were controlled. The timing of the controls and detailed data of the samples are annexed. It has to be stated that the sampling method adopted was of instantaneous type and that all sampling operations and analysis were performed in compliance with regulations and in presence of the party.Moreover it has to be stated that the analysis of TDI (toluene di-isocyante) and aromatic amines&nbsp; showed the presence of TDI with concentrations corresponding to 5280 mg/l and traces of aromatic amines (0.2 mg/l of aniline, 0,1 mg/l of p-toluidine). The concentration values of dichlorobenzenes&nbsp; (chlorinated solvents not mentioned elsewhere) and of organic aromatic solvents (toluene)- all compounds used in the production process involved in the accident - were also particularly high.During the inspection on 29/11/2002 two successive sampling operations were performed on the terminal gully of drain SM15/3 with the goal of verifying the characteristics of the effluents discharged in two distinct periods. This procedure was adopted following the observation during the inspection that the characteristics of the effluents varied strongly.Annex 2 of the present report (annex no 2) lists the values of the samples taken during several inspections made on drain SM15/3 resulting above the threshold values defined by D.P.R. 962/73 and D.M. 30.7.1999. Drain SM 15/3 discharges into the main sewage channel conventionally called SM15, which discharges into the lagoon via the Malamocco-Marghera Channel. It has to be mentioned that the sewage discharged by drain SM15/3 is not subject to any additional treatment downstream of the terminal gully from which the samples were taken. Only in one sample, corresponding to record no. 2663 taken on 29/11/2002, were traces of TDI&nbsp; found (15 mg/l), while in the samples taken afterwards the concentrations of the compound were below the sensitivity of the test method adopted.In conclusion it is considered that consequent to the accident that occurred on 28/11/2002 at the establishment Dow Poliuretani Italia Srl drain SM 15/3 caused a temporary but consistent pollution of the lagoon water. The polluting substances were channelled into the lagoon via the general drain SM15 of the establishment, spreading in the aquatic environment and modifying the chemical characteristics of the water in the lagoon up to 1 km from the establishment. #omisis#The characteristics of the fire and the atmospheric conditions characterised by very slight wind and stability probably favoured an umbrella like fallout pattern of the pollutants around the establishment, which resulted quite uniform, with peak concentrations in the SW sector in the direction of the monitoring stations of&nbsp; via Bottenigo and of Malcontenta and with slightly lower concentrations in the opposite sector in the direction of the city of Mestre.The TDI fire and of the other substances present in the installation caused an increase of the substances typical for combustion processes (nitrogen oxides, carbon oxide and hydrocarbons in a minor proportion), even if the absolute values measured are comparable with the values measured during traffic peak hours in stable meteorological conditions.The increase of toluene is much more significant and to a minor extent the increase of Ethyl-benzene and Xylenes; the absolute values were higher, although not much higher, than the values measured at peak hours of days with high traffic rates.It is interesting to note how the concentration ratio toluene/benzene increased by a factor&nbsp; between 7 and 8 with respect to normal traffic conditions, which may indicate the presence of toluene originating from the accidental event.Moreover the values measured for styrene, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, trimethylbenzene do not differ much from the values indicated in literature for highly urbanised and industrialised areas.It is important to note the absence of dichlorobenzenes in all air samples of the urban areas, even the ones taken in the most critical fallout phase, whereas dichlorobenzenes were found in significant concentrations in proximity of the accident place even the morning after the fire.The concentration of hydrogen chloride measured on the over-bridge in Mestre, in the peak fallout time (between 22:00 and 23:00) is also worthy of note; it could no longer be&nbsp; detected the next morning.The concentrations of dioxins, furans, and PCBs similar to dioxins, measured by CO.INCA (Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale Chimica per líAmbiente ñ Interuniversitary Consortium foe Environmental Chemistry) on the total particulate were undoubtedly low, the total values were comparable with the background concentration levels indicated by literature for urban areas.At time of the present report, the research for organic micro-pollutants on the atmospheric particulate and on ash-sludge in the fire zone, was still in progress.","ON SITEConsequent to the explosion and the subsequent fire, in the control room the assistant on duty in department TD1-3 released the general alarm and activated the emergency shut down procedure for securing the plant, while the assistant on duty in plant TD 4-5 put on the self-contained breathing apparatus and performed a series of operations for securing the plant.AT 19:47 hrs the national fire brigade was alerted over the telephone;At 19:49 hrs the preliminary alarm was released in the department; At 19:52 the general alarm was released in the whole installation;In the standard on-site emergency response procedure of the establishment a distinction is made between two failure situations:state of alarm: a situation in which the unfavourable evolution of an emergency in a department appears to be likely.state of emergency: a situation in which the unfavourable evolution of an emergency in a department has the potential to involve entire areas of the establishmentFrom 19:59 hrs to 20:06 hrs the procedure of communicating the event&nbsp; via fax to the public authorities was activated.The extinguishing operations were performed by the fire brigade of EniChem employing extinguishing foam, while the fire brigade of Venice carried out the cooling of the adjoining plants and equipment with water hydrants, the containment of the gas emissions with water curtains and the monitoring of temperatures with infrared-cameras.At 20:45 the fire could be considered as extinguished.AT 22:45 the on-site emergency was called off.OFF SITEAt 20:30 hrs the acoustic alarm for the population was activated&nbsp; over the acoustic system located in Marghera.At 21:30 the off-site emergency was called off.Emergency Measures - Remarks:At 19:47 following the signalling of the emergency by the workers of the Dow plant the shift technician of EniChem in charge of emergency signalling alerted the works fire brigade and then the national fire brigade.All equipment was secured and the fire put under control by approximately 20:30 hrs, thanks to the rapid response of the works fire brigade located inside the chemical pole at a distance of 700-800 meters from the accident place, associated with the intervention of the national fire brigade of Venice and the rapid response of the plant personnel releasing the emergency shut down of the plant over the automatic shut down systems. The members of the fire brigade of Venice equipped with an infrared-camera monitored the temperature of the structures and of the equipment during the fire and at the same time provided the cooling of the structures and equipment affected by the fire.Official action taken - legal action: A penal action was started against some mangers of the TDI plant. Some minor civil actions for biological damage were also started.Official action taken - other official action: SPISAL (Service for the Prevention, the Hygiene and the Safety in the Working Environment) applied sanctions against three managers according to D.Lgs. 626/94 e D. Lgs.758/94. The Ministry for the Environment  requested the conclusion of the assessment of the SMS foreseen by article 25 of D.Lgs. 334/99 and the judicial investigation according to art. 21 of D.Lgs. 334/99
","Measures to prevent recurrence: Risk analysisFollowing the accidental event of November 2002 a thorough safety assessment of the plant starting from the cause analysis has been further developed using different up to date methodologies.The studies and analysis listed below, applied to the high-boiling tars section and to the entire TDI production process, followed by the implementation of technical and procedural changes, demonstrate the high safety standard reached and maintained and in particular with regards to process control, management of failures and accident prevention.The characteristics of the high-boiling tars processing section of department TD5, and particularly concerning the chemical behaviour of the products processed, correlated with the parameter of residence time, temperature and composition, lead to the accident dynamics of November 2002 being considered anomalous, due to the fact that it could not have happened in any other section of the department or in any other phase of the processing cycle. LPP (Loss Prevention Programme) Guidelines for the analysis of the compliance of the process with the accident prevention principles.This methodology was developed by the technological centre of the company based on the experience gained in the establishments of Dow and other major companies operating worldwide.The compliance with these guidelines allows the performance in terms of safety and operating reliability in general to be improved.These guidelines often reflect the entire experience and knowledge gained on the management of process plants and the process anomalies that may occur in any of the activities involved in the management of a chemical plant (design, process control, operation, safety procedures, equipment).Analysis of the management systems of the combustion plants.As for the foregoing guidelines this tool is used inside the company to compare the combustion systems (heating furnaces, steam generators) with the most advanced technologies in the field of safety and reliability.During the audit the problems concerning the management of the furnaces, the safety systems (alarms, shut-down systems), the control systems and the process parameters were analysed, using the most advanced international standards as reference and complying with Italian and European norms.- Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA)The LOPA analysis is a simplified form of risk analysis that analyses the risk of an undesired event over the magnitude of the event frequencies, effect gravity and event probability.The LOPA process builds a risk analysis process using all data available from the Dow technological centre, from the databases of the company, from the plant histories and using the specific knowledge of the process engineers of the plants (from Dow or other companies).The analysis demonstrates that the implemented safety systems are adequate to obtain acceptable risk levels.- Investigation into the problems concerning chemical reactivityAll aspects concerning chemical reactivity of the substances present in the TDI production cycle were examined very closely; product incompatibilities and eventual instabilities were analysed.Chemical reactivity matrices and reference guidelines, based on Dow's experience, have been issued for the personnel of all Dow installations and in particular for those producing isocyanates.A detailed analysis was&nbsp; performed on the reactivity of TDI and high-boiling tar mixtures with respect to different parameters, such as temperature, residence time and composition, referring also to the accident that occurred in November 2002.Paragraph 2.4 lists the studies carried out, these studies have been used to increase the safety of various sections.-Definition of Process Safety Cardinal RulesDevelopment and implementation of the cardinal rules concerning the process safety during production of dinitrotoluene, toluene di-amine, toluene di-isocyanate and phosgene.These rules have been developed based on the experience of Dow and other leading companies gained in plant management; the rules indicate in a clear and concise way the criticality of different process phases, pointing out the operations to be avoided, with the goal of operating at the highest safety levels.- Pre start-up Audit As foreseen by the procedures of the company an audit was performed on the plant to check if there were the necessary safety conditions to restart the plant following the recent shut-down for maintenance.The audit was carried out on the entire plant with particular attention on the high-boiling tars processing section upstream the introduction of chemical reagents in the process; the&nbsp; performance of all foreseen test procedures on equipment and piping subject to maintenance was audited, and adequate training of the operative plant personnel was verified with specific checklists.The implementation of the procedures contained in the operative manual was verified with a particular focus on the safety standards.- Updating of the operative manualThe entire operative manual of the department was revised, not only with regards to the high-boiling tars treatment section, which was the main reason of the revision, but also for all departments of the plant.- Management of change (MoC)All technical or procedural changes have to be assessed through a MoC procedure analysing the consequences of the change with specific checklists with the participation of all roles involved.When the present report was issued, it was foreseen that by the time&nbsp; modifications were operative&nbsp; the operating procedures for the modified plant would also be available and the training of the personnel would have been concluded"

411,843,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Leak of benzene without ignition from a pump of a pipeline connecting a jetty with a hydrocarbon tank farm,1992-11-07 02:00:00,1992-11-07 00:00:00,"ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:
Light wind from jetty to tank farm. Temperature slightly above freezing (around the freezing point of benzene). Ground wet due to recent rains.

ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
At 02:00 hours an operator detected a smell of benzene in the proximity of pump P-104. On investigating, he detected liquid escaping from a hose attached to a valve on the pump (this valve was found to be half open and was immediately closed). A sizeable quantity of liquid, thought to be a benzene/water mixture, was observed in the pipetrack. Management was alerted. No other people were working in the vicinity of the leak. It was found that the liquid was flowing along the pipetrack to the jetty and the jetty manager was informed by telephone. A considerable quantity of liquid was found to have collected in a sump on the jetty premises (this was part of the jetty pipeline containment system but not intended to collect liquid from the jetty tank farm). There was considerable soil contamination round this jetty tank farm pipeline (this pipeline did not have a proper containment system). On investigating, it was found that plant instrumentation detected and recorded a slow leak from the tank associated with this pipeline between 20:00 hours the previous evening and 02:00 hours. The leak was too slow to show up on the control panel display and was also masked by a ship loading benzene for part of the time. No people were affected by benzene fumes and no ignition occurred. It is estimated that benzene levels in the vicinity of the leak and along the pipetrack to the sump were likely to exceed the occupational exposure standard.  An ignition would have had major consequences.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The leak of benzene involved the pump used to transfer benzene from the storage tank to the nearby jetty. Since the valve on a spare pressure gauge of the pump was not fully closed after a sampling operation, about 19,000 kg of benzene were lost over a period of six hours until the leak was detected.
CAUSES:
In order to allow the operators to take a quality control sample of the product immediately prior to ship loading, sampling points were provided on the tanks. For the benzene tank, due to security fencing, the access route to the sampling points was circuitous and the operators had got into the practice of taking a sample at the ""degassing"" point on the pump. This practice was apparently not known to management (probably including foreman). A hose was left attached to the connection point to facilitate this operation. The practice had been on-going for some months. In this occasion the operator failed to fully close the valve. The pump was bunded, but the length of hose extended beyond the bunding and the end was lying at the pipetrack. No equipment defects or failures were involved in the leak. Underlying cause was failure of management control and supervision, together with inadequate training and failure by operator to follow operating procedures.The accident occurred because of an operator error (code 5401) that failed to fully close the valve installed on the spare pressure gauge connection on a pump. The ""cap"" was removed to take a quality control sample of benzene but this procedure was apparently not known to management above foreman level. Underlying causes were therefore the management failure in control and supervision (codes 5301 and 5305), together with an inadequate operator training (codes 5304 and 5303).","ECOLOGICAL HARM:No significant environmental harms occurred, except the soil contamination along the pipeline track containment and in the area where the leak of benzene occurred.MATERIAL LOSS:No data are available about the cost of removal and disposal as a waste of the contaminated soil.People - Remarks: Though it has been estimated that the benzene concentrations in air in the proximity of the leak and along the pipetrack to the sump were likely to exceed the occupational exposure standard, no people were affected by benzene fumes.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:After the valve was closed, the internal company fire services were called out. They covered the spillage with ""light water foam"". Measurements of benzene concentration were taken and the area around the accident was cordoned off. The furnace of a nearby process plant was shut-down. The on-site emergency plan was not activated.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The adjacent jetty premises were informed but the off-site emergency plan was not activated. Arrangement was made to empty the sump that collected the spillage of benzene.The soil will be removed and disposed as contaminated waste (code 7601). Both on-site and off-site emergency plans were not activated. No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, it was established to improve the training of the operators and supervision.Measures to mitigate consequences: Inside the establishment, the soil decontaminate as soon as possible by flooding area with water, draining the spillage into gullies and pumping it out. The soil will be removed and disposed as contaminated waste. Outside the establishment, the pipeline track containment system decontaminated by water washing."

On 28 July 1997, the operator in charge of the plant died as a consequence of severe burns.

The extinguishing water was collected in the installation's own sewage treatment plant and treated with a full biological process.","A helicopter was used to fly the operator in charge of the plant to a hospital with a first aid surgery department for additional medical treatment. The on-site emergency service, alerted by automatic fire warning devices (rate-of-rise heat detector and a flame warning device), arrived at the accident site at 17.06, and fire fighting operations were started Soon (at ca. 17.15) a trailer with 250 kg of extinguishing chemical powder was added to the equipment being used, in order to make a more effective extinguishing effect.
The installation's technical manager, who was present when the accident occurred, shut off the hydrogen supply from the storage tanks at ca.17.06 by closing the shutoff valves.
By 17.44 the fire had been extinguished and the alert state could be terminated.
The professional fire department and the Minden Municipal Voluntary Fire Department were alerted as a precautionary measure; there was however no necessity for their active intervention in the fire fighting operations.

414,578,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Explosion during the charging of a reactor containing a mixture of acetone and methanol,1985-02-12 00:00:00,1985-02-12 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
While two operators were charging fibre drums of a penicillin material into a reactor containing a mixture of acetone and methanol, an explosion occurred at the reactor man-hole. The two operators were blown back by the force of the explosion. They were covered with a wet burnt powder. Two other operators, who were opening the drums 2 metres away, were also blown back and covered with wet powder. Subsequently, all four operators were drenched under emergency showers. They suffered superficial burns to the hands and face and spent one night in a local hospital. They suffered no side-effects.
","CAUSES:
Investigations showed that the incident was initiated by the ignition of solvent vapours, which resulted in a dust explosion of the dry powder. The solvent mixture in the reactor did not ignite. Tests carried out on the polyethylene liners inside the fibre drums showed they were earthed to the reactor at the time of the explosion but they were of the non-conducting type. The most probable cause of the ignition was an electrostatic discharge from the polyethylene bags during the reactor charging. The underlying causes were inadequate process analysis and design plant, together with a lack of safety culture, that allowed to operate with the risk of a dust explosion.
",EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:4 people were injured by the explosion. All were covered with a wet burnt powder and were drenched under emergency showers. They suffered superficial burns to the hands and face and spent one night in a local hospital. They suffered no side-effects.MATERIAL LOSS:The total cost of the material losses has been evaluated at about 0.00648 M Euros. The extents of the material losses were: both front and side pressure relief windows in the process area blown out; one roof vent just above the reactor slightly lifted; the flexible extractor hose above the reactor burnt.Affected Area: installation,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Company personnel put out the fire with fire extinguishers.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:No off-site emergency measures were necessary. The local fire brigade with 10 firemen arrived on-site within minutes after the explosion but no intervention was required since the fire was already put out by the company personnel using fire extinguishers.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the company was requested to:
1- use nitrogen inerting when pouring dry powders into flammable solvents;
2- where possible, use properly earthed metal scoops instead of polyethylene bags to transfer dry powders;
3- use conductive polyethylene bags only;&nbsp;4- avoid pouring dry powders into flammable solvents;
5- carry out an electrostatic review on the whole plant and all the processes."

This accident is notified because two persons were intoxicated in Germany, on of was hospitalised more than three days.The accident is classified at level 2 of the of the accident gravity scale made official in February 1994 by the committee of competent authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive (level two due to the intoxication of 5 persons and level 2 for the economic loss caused by the accident).","At 19:50 a black out in the electrical network released the onsite emergency plan in the different production workshops. The units were shut down at 20:15. In such circumstances, it is foreseen that the workshops transfer the products under process to the two flare units of the site. The diesel emergency generator sets foreseen to Take relief in case of black out did not power up fast enough to assure the cooling of the reactors of line 1 and 2 during the shut down phase of the workshop.","A large smoke cloud formed due to the combustion of the discharged products in the flare system and dispersed in the atmosphere during exceptional meteorological conditions with rainstorms.The meteorological conditions were adverse (low wind speed), the styrene cloud affected 3 neighbours of the municipality of Hopital (France) and 2 neighbours of the municipality of Leuterbach (Germanz), including a child hospitalised during 3 days.Between 7 and 9 p.m., sensors close to the petrochemical plant recorded high concentrations of dust, SO2 (585 µg/m# over a quarter hour) and orthoxylene (535 µg/m# over a quarter hour) probably due to styrene (compatible chemical characteristics). The high SO2 readings may be due to units on the site, as well as to the coke plant supplying the nearby power station. This is because a condensation separator on the coke plant's gas line self-ignited at about 4 p.m. The electricity supply shut-down resulted in production losses of 0.5 to 2 million euros.",The onsite emergency plan was activated. The emergency response services took rapidly control of the situation.,"In compliance with the urgent prefectural decree issued 06/07/05 - a report on&nbsp; the failure cause of the emergency generator sets was submitted,&nbsp; - the start-up sequential of the generator sets was modified- the risk assessment&nbsp; and the Onsite&nbsp; Emergency Plan were completedThis measures have allowed the operator to start up the polymer plant again. DRIRE has proposed to issue an additional prefectrural decree imposing the operator to review all emergency generator sets present on the petrochemical installation and to perform a study identifying all potential release points of hazardous substances in the installation including the nature of the substances and the quantities potentially released.

416,610,Major Accident,Electronics & electrical engineering,HCl cloud dispersion due to silicon tetrachloride release,1998-04-26 20:22:00,1998-04-27 01:00:00,"At 20:22 of 26 April 1998 (Sunday) an operator of the plant saw white fumes (Smoke) in correspondence with the CDI unit, adjacent to the hydrogen compression room and to the refrigeration units. The operator alerted the foreman, then the shutdown operation of the plant being controlled by a microprocessor with display on the control-panel was activated. This shut down operation involved the realisation of a by-pass for the part of the plant involved, operation which was foreseen by the emergency plan, with the assistance of the onsite fire brigade. At the same time the voluntary fire brigades of Merano, Maia Bassa, Maia Alta, Quarazze, Montefranco, Postal, Lana, Lagundo and Marlengo arrived, having been alerted by some person passing by who had seen the fumes (smoke). When the personnel identified the source of the fumes as a release of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) which combined with water (H2O), forms hydrochloric acid (HCl), which actually occurred due to the presence of humidity in the air and in the soil, forming a visible column of white fumes (smoke); the personnel proceeded in realising a vertical water barrier (curtain, in compliance with the emergency plan, in order to avoid the displacement of the fumes (Smoke) due to the  wind, attempting at the same time to avoid the direct contact of the water with the SiCl4 . The fire fighting teams which arrived from offsite attempted, on the command of their coordinators, to abate the fumes (smoke) without any discrimination with water hydrants. This caused the intensification of the chemical reaction described above. Further to the water also a special foam (suitable for non-flammable products) of RID class 8 type was employed. Following the above described facts the fumes moved in direction of the wind (southwards) affecting also residential areas and the National road. The water used by the emergency teams was collected in a extinguishing water collection basin, foreseen for being treated in the sewage plant (with pH correction, etc.)",failure of the safety valveThe gravity of the accident has been increased due to the use of water hydrants in the abatement of the fumes,"Ecological damage: principally concerning the area of ground directly in front of the plant in the area corresponding to the position of the valve (approx. 400 m2) inside the establishment.

417,755,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Explosion of a tank containing sodium borohydride solution,1996-09-02 14:30:00,1996-09-02 00:00:00,"Interest of the accident in which a hydride is involved. Violent explosion took place during the batch production of chlorobenzorex from an aqueous solution of sodium borohydride contained in a feed tank on a movable truck.&nbsp;The sodium borohydride solution (44 kg of powder for 130 kg of solution) was prepared 2 hours before production in a closed 630 litre agitated feed tank. Since dissolving was problematic, the operating mode was recently modified to include prior heating of the solution by hot water surface runoff (45- 55°C). The reactor was placed under nitrogen circulation (N2) at 2h00 and then connected to the feed tank whose heating was stopped. At 2.15 pm, the feed tank's N2 inlet was connected to the supply hose. At 2.20 pm, N2 supply to the feed tank started with the partial opening of the supply valves of the reactor and the valves at the bottom of the feed tank (at a flow rate of 100 l/h - P(N2) = 2.8 bar). At 2.40 pm, the N2 hose supplying the feed tank was abruptly torn out letting the gas escape though the opening created. The superfluous staff was evacuated from the workshop and an emergency team installed a valve on the N2 inlet to stop the leak. The team tired to decompress the feed tank in the reactor by opening the reactor valve to the maximum and then opening the feed tank valve that was difficult to access. At this moment, the feed tank's manhole gave in a few seconds before it exploded.","Post-accident investigations revealed thermal decomposition of sodium borohydride triggered by an excessively high storage temperature (50 °C due to hot water surface runoff). Maintaining the temperature at 50 °C stabilised the decomposition rate in such a way that the small quantities of hydrogen (H2) formed could escape via the leaking feed tank. When the heating was stopped, the system evolved in an independent way: the temperature and pressure increased under the effect of heat resulting from the decomposition causing a thermal explosion. The inspection hole opened under a pressure of 15 to 20 bar followed by the rupture of the feed tank. The depressurisation of H2 in the form of a shock wave was responsible for the damage caused in the workshop.
Lastly, poor knowledge of the properties of hydride and absence of a critical analysis of the process were also responsible for the accident. Modification procedures and taking into account the various productions incidents would have certainly led to the missing critical analysis.","The workshop was devastated: roof ripped out, light walls displaced, solvent pipes ruptured by the projections. The feed tank was destroyed but the remaining process equipment was not damaged. Outside the workshop but near a door, a technician was projected against the containers by the shock wave. He sustained injuries on the ribs and was hospitalised for a month.",The internal fire-fighting service establishes a safety zone and begins with the first investigation (see attached accident report),"Study on the stability and violent decomposition of sodium borohydride, sodium borohydride won't be used in the establishment for time being until new safety measures have not been put into place."

The cause of the accident was that when workers used hydrogen peroxide to handle sulfur-containing impurities of benzene, they poured hydrogen peroxide into the reactor too fast, causing the reactor to explode due to dramatic chemical reactions. After the accident happened, the local government urgently evacuated more than 6,000 students and residents of nearby schools and residential areas. While firefighters put out the fire caused by the explosion, the firefighting water carried unburned benzene (about 4t) into Guixi River in Xinmin Town, threatening the downstream drinking water sources (Guixi River flows into Caojia River which flows into Gaotan River. Although there is no drinking water fetching point along Gaotan River, the river flows into Longxi River, along which a downstream lake called Changshou Lake is the drinking water fetching point of Changshou District of Chongqing. The drinking water fetching point is about 123km from the explosion place).","The cause of the accident was that when workers used hydrogen peroxide to handle sulfur-containing impurities of benzene, they poured hydrogen peroxide into the reactor too fast, causing the reactor to explode due to dramatic chemical reactions. ",In the explosion 1 person died and 5 people injured.,"After the accident happened, the local government urgently evacuated more than 6,000 students and residents of nearby schools and residential areas. While firefighters put out the fire caused by the explosion, the firefighting water carried unburned benzene (about 4t) into Guixi River in Xinmin Town, threatening the downstream drinking water sources (Guixi River flows into Caojia River which flows into Gaotan River. Although there is no drinking water fetching point along Gaotan River, the river flows into Longxi River, along which a downstream lake called Changshou Lake is the drinking water fetching point of Changshou District of Chongqing. The drinking water fetching point is about 123km from the explosion place).
Based on the site pollution situation and the pollution handling progress, the emergency command headquarters took a series of effective measures:
1) It ordered the downstream Changshou District to closely monitor the river water at the point where the river flows into the territory of the district; once an excessive concentration of benzene was found, monitoring workers were instructed to immediately report this to the district government and release information to the public about the situation of the drinking water source;
2) It ordered the government of Dianjiang County to completely isolate the pollutants at the accident site and to handle the isolated benzene;
3) It ordered various levels of local environmental protection departments to closely monitor the environment, to closely track the movement and concentration change of the pollutants, to predict the diffusion trend of the benzene pollutant according to the hydrological parameters of the river, and to timely evaluate the blockade and adsorption effect of pollutants along the river; and
4) It closed the waterlocks of Gaoan Dam and Gaodong Dam in the upstream of Changshou Lake to cut off water flowing into the territory of the Changshou District, ensuring that the pollutants would be blocked within the upstream river of Gaodong Dam and preventing the pollutants from entering the Changshou Lake.
After five days of salvage and adsorption, most of benzene was adsorbed, rescued and evaporated within the Caojia River, and only a small amount (about 63kg according to estimates and calculation) entered Gaotan River; after multiple layers of adsorption and treatment, the pollutants were basically eliminated between the Sanhe Estuary of Gaotan River and Gaoan Dam. As of 4:00 pm on Nov. 29, after more than 40 hours of continuous emergency treatment, no benzene was detected in the entire Gaotan River. The threat of the pollutants downstream of the Gantan River had already been eliminated. The pollutants did not affect the Longxi River and the Changshou Lake, which is a drinking water source for residents of Changshou District. At 7:00 pm on Nov. 29, Chongqing municipal government finally lifted the alarm related to the environmental pollution caused by the explosion accident. Environmental protection departments of both Chongqing Municipality and Dianjiang County responded rapidly, organizing environmental monitoring workers to deploy 10 monitoring points within an about 100km range along Caojia River, Gaotan River and Longxi River to continuously monitor the water quality and to closely track the drift of the pollution belt. The Dianjiang county government immediately set up an accident rescue and investigation group and took effective measures to prevent the diffusion of pollutants. In the 24km-long Caojia River, the group urgently used straw, activated carbon and charcoal to build 9 dams to block pollutants from drifting downstream.
","Avoid ad hoc changes to the formula and follow written procedures, specification of the speed rate to prevent overcharging.Operators have to be aware of potential chemical risks, reactivity and the characteristics of the chemical material they handle.

424,1224,Near Miss,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire in Compressor Unit Methanol Production Facility,2020-12-02 00:00:00,2020-12-02 00:00:00,"

A fire occured in the compressor house of the methanol plant. In this compressor house, in addition to containing equipment for compressing the synthesis gas (H2, CO2 and CO), there was also located a steam powered turbine generator with belonging equipment. When the fire started, the methanol plant was shut down. The attempted emergency stop of the steam powered turbine generator resulted in a total breakdown of the generator. Several components loosened from the turbine, were flung out with great force, and hit pipelines for the lube oil system inside the compressor house. This caused a lube oil leak, which ignited.The fire did not spread to the other systems in the compressor house. The incident had a major accident potential and could have caused serious personal injury or death as well as substantial economic loss.

","Direct cause: The direct cause of the turbine breakdown with subsequent fire was that isolation from the steam network at the intermediate pressure level failed to function as intended during emergency shut down of the system. This happened because a back flow valve did not function as intended. The back flow of steam increased the rotation in the turbine, which again caused that components loosened from the turbine and were flung out with great force.
Underlying causes are: The criticality of the valve was from the start of the plant wrongfully classified as low. This mistake had not been identified in later system reviews of the maintenance system. Due to this, only temporary repairs had been made on the valve that should prevent back flow of steam from the steam pipelines to the steam turbine, even though they had experienced problems with the valve for a long time. Nine corrective jobs had been performed on this valve during the last year, the latest work order on the valve's actuator had not been performed according to the deadline, and because the valve was not identified as safety critical this delay was not evaluated.&nbsp;","Consequences: The actual consequences of the turbine breakdown were that turbine components came loose and caused damage to equipment and the building. Objects struck by components included piping for the turbine&rsquo;s lube oil system. The leaking lube oil ignited and caused a fire which lasted about an hour, but the fire did not spread to other systems in the compressor house. About 1 000 litres of lube oil are estimated to have leaked out. No physical injuries were sustained as a result of the incident.
Because of the incident, production from the methanol plant was down for about 12 weeks. The plant came back on line in week 7 without the damaged turbine.
Potential consequences: In the event of a turbine trip, plant operators are supposed to make a physical check of the turbine generator. Had an operator or other personnel been in the compressor house when the breakdown occurred, they could have been struck by flying components. The latter have also been hurled with great force through the walls of the compressor house and could have hit people outside the building.
Flying components have also hit the synthesis gas plant located in the same building. Had this caused a synthesis gas leak, the outcome could have been an explosion and/or a large fire. On that basis, the company's assessment is that the incident had a major accident potential and could have caused serious personal injury or death as well as substantial financial loss.","Operators in the plant informed the control room about noise and vibrations at the same time as automatic fire detectors and fire alarms were activated. ESD and Internal Emergency plan were activated, and Municipal fire brigade and other emergency- and rescue services contacted. ESD included disconnection of the energy supply to the control room, activation of deluge and pressure relief. In addition to evacuation alarm, sirenes and loudspeakers informed about the situation and asked personnel to evacuate. Two stationary water cannons located 30 meters from the compressor building were activated manually. Two municipal firebrigades, police and other rescue services took part.
Approximately 40 persons were evacuated from the plant.","
Insufficient identification of safety critical equipment and systematic follow up of technical integrity.
Insufficient barriers for reducing the possibility of dangerous situations.
Documentation for mechanical components was not easily available

425,1230,Major Accident,"Waste storage, treatment and disposal",Fire in a hazardous waste warehouse (storage),2020-03-12 18:35:00,2020-03-13 02:30:00,"A fire broke out in an open sided, roof covered storage facility (area of 1560 square meters, hereinafter: Open warehouse) in the northern part of the plant. In the Open warehouse, 252 tons of hazardous waste was stored. The following materials were stored separately, but close to each other around the point of origin of the fire: EWC 06 05 02*; EWC 06 13 02*; EWC 18 01 06*. Based on the industrial camera records, a luminous phenomenon was visible first, then smoke started to spread in the Open warehouse. At that time, the event was discovered by a worker in the area, who alarmed the management by two-way radio. When the fire ignited, 3 workers were presented at the plant. The industrial fire brigade did not manage to take the fire under control, therefore it spread to empties and containers containing combustible materials stored nearby the Open warehouse. As a consequence of the fire, the roof of the Open warehouse collapsed and the fire spread off-site, where vegetation was burned on the territory of the neighboring sites (not dangerous establishments) and railway embankments. On the affected railway tracks cargo trains were lined up with empty uncleaned tanks. The exposed railroad cars were towed from the scene. A secondary fire hotspot was formed at the area of the Open warehouse, because of the stored flammable wastes (eg.: other fuels, including mixtures, EWC 13 07 03 *).","The operator led an investigation (event analyses) following the accident. The most relevant findings were the followings:
A barrel - containing paint-foam waste as an organic solvent - was presumably overfilled by its previous owner before it arrived at the plant and was stored-in in the Open warehouse. The significant temperature rise before the day of the accident led to the splitting of this barrel. Next to that barrel, activated charcoal waste (contaminated raw material) was stored, and most likely spilled to the ground prior to the accident. The methyl-acetate/ethyl-acetate content of the organic solvent reacted catalytically with the activated carbon. This dangerous exotherm reaction generated a local fire, which spread and caused the rupture and ignition of some nearby barrels, containing highly flammable organic solvents. The security system did not indicate any intrusion before the fire.","The incident did not cause any injuries. The generated combustion materials lifted quickly and reached the upper layers of the air, therefore no hazardous substances were detected in harmful concentrations within the site area or at the residential areas. The extinguishing water and foam mixed up with the hazardous materials in the storage facility and overflowed the bund. The mixture spread to the area next to the storage facility and into the rainwater drainage system. Soil replacement was required in the contaminated areas. The operator estimated the financial damage to HUF 180 million (EUR 531 616).","Workers on the site reported the fire to the industrial fire brigade and were able to initiate the internal emergency plan. The industrial fire brigade arrived at the scene 3-4 minutes after the alarm and began extinguishing the fire. Once it became apparent that the industrial fire brigade could not take the fire under control, the professional fire service was alarmed.&nbsp; The industrial fire brigade took part in the operation with 6 fire trucks and 11 firemen, while the professional fire service deployed 14 fire trucks and 36 firemen. During the intervention, 2 mounted and 2 installable water cannons were operated and 4 foam nozzles and 4 water nozzles were used to take the fire under control. 2 CBRN Hazmat Units performed continuous meteorological and concentration measurements on-site and in the residential area to protect the firefighters and the population around the plant.
The operation was hindered because the extinguishing water mixed with solvents harmful to health and dangerous to the environment, and the mixture overflowed the bund so the contaminated extinguishing water had to be pumped during the operation. Also, it was not possible to completely extinguish the fire under the collapsed roof structure until it was removed.
Summary of the extent of the fire as the incident progressed:
- Upon the arrival of the industrial fire brigade, the Open warehouse burned to approximately 600-700 m2.
- The fire spread to combustible materials stored in the vicinity of the warehouse, which meant an additional 200 m2 of fire-area.
- By the time the professional fire service arrived, the Open warehouse and the surrounding area were already on fire at 1,200 m2.
- In total, the fire affected about 6,000 m2, which included the area of the Open warehouse itself, the outside storage area in its vicinity, the greenery within the site area and of the surrounding plants (not Seveso sites).","The most relevant lessons learned are the following:

- Operators should check the filling degree of the containers, containing hazardous waste liquids, prior to receiving.


- Operators should consider and, where appropriate, limit the amount of hazardous waste received and collected at the site.


- The well-known, direct partner's deliveries should be subject to the same examination as the new and unknown deliveries.


- Operators should pay attention to the deliberate design of the storage-procedures where storing together different types of hazardous wastes, considering the amount of hazardous substances at the same time, as well as their potential hazardous reactions with each other.


- To increase safety and prevent the harmful effects of temperature rise of the stored wastes, the practice of controlling the temperature of the stored materials (manually or automated) should be developed.


- Hazardous waste treatment plants should pay exceptional attention to the prevention of spillage and the damage of packaging on their sites.


- In order to detect and extinguish the fires quickly, automated fire detection and extinguishing system installation should be considered for the storage facilities of flammable liquids and solid wastes, even if it would not be mandatory by an official or legal obligation.
&nbsp;
- During the intervention, the possible harmful effects of the extinguishing water must be monitored. Good practices that can be developed with the involvement of the firefighters can have further mitigating effects on the environmental risk of the extinguishing water used.

Second incident: on the base of the available registrations, the cause may have been a series of erroneous consecutive actions by the operator who misinterpreted the instruments indications, and his disposition for the conduction of the process.The consequences of the second incident could have been more serious (not only with damage to structures, but also to people- it needs to be noted that the incident occurred in a zone in which numerous personnel, either internal or external, were present for the modifications going on the near-by plants), if the ""all clear"" internal alarm was given immediately after the end of the first accident; in that case many persons would have returned to their job and would have been taken by surprise by the second accident. This conclusion is supported by the considerable damages received by the materials (crane with extensible arm, van for material transport, hut from sheets of metals, materials for changes of parts, etc...) in a radius of 50 m from the explosion point.","The escape of the hydrocarbons contained in the tank TK103 occurred probably due to 
a human error, during the manual operation of the dilution of the sodium hydroxide 
solution (routine operation), protracted for an excessive time, leading to the overflow 
and emission of hydrocarbons in the canals and their flushing shafts collecting white 
waters. The overflowing hydrocarbons reached the zone in which workers performed 
the welding. The following fire and the extinguishing operations caused the activation 
of the protection devices of the grounding system, which resulted in interruption of the 
electrical supply. Such interruption provoked the gasoil supply loss in the oven F301 in 
which the second accident occurred.  The increase in the temperature and pressure 
inside the pipes in which gasoil + H2 should have circulated occurred due to this 
supply loss, with consequent overheating of the pipes resulting in rupture and 
explosion.  Also in this case, a human error can be reasonably presumed, based on the 
available computerised registrations, consisting of the undue silencing of alarms due to 
insufficient supply and of high temperature and pressure and the subsequent omitted 
interventions as foreseen by the existing procedures.

"," A welder worker received burns in face in the first fire and light trauma to the rear. 
Other 3 workers were presented in the infirmary; some of them showed effects of light 
state of shock or breathing difficulties.  In no case was the doctors intervention 
required but all workers were sent home.  A worker of an external company, escaping, 
received an injury by a nail in the palm of the left hand. In general the cures given 
were first aid, or administration of sedatives or oxygen in the case of respiratory 
problems.
Material damages caused by the first fire around the sodium hydroxide recipient 
(rupture of electrical cables and of the insulation of the pipes connecting to the tank. 
The second event provoked besides the damages to the oven and to the connecting 
pipes, also damages to mobile devices like a crane truck, a light lorry required for the 
modification works in progress and glass breakage and other damages to various 
objects inside a radius of 50m from the point of the explosion.
People - Remarks: The total number of persons at risk in the first event, considering its characteristics  (fire not particularly 
extended) can be quantified to 6-7, the intervention personnel included. In the second event, characterised 
by the potential of greater consequences, also if it was of shorter duration, the persons at risk are not easily 
quantifiable, since in the area there could have been present also people not directly involved in the 
modification operations.
Ecological harm - Remarks: Meteorological data registrations give for the time of the accidents wind velocity of 1,9-3 m/s with variable direction between W-NW and E. The registrations concerning SO2, NOx, NO e NO2 of 6 fixed positions around the establishment indicate an increase of the normal mean value from 9 to 12 hrs. The maximum value of SO2 (282 ug/m3) was registered at about 10hrs at S-SE of the establishment. Max. for NOx (55,2 ppb) at 11hrs at S-SE.
Material loss - Remarks: At the moment of the on-the-spot investigation the costs were not quantifiable, however they refer to the restoration of damaged parts of the plant and limited to the internal of the establishment.Disruption of community life: The news of the incident were reported at a national level by the ANSA agency and by ""Televideo RAI""Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","The internal procedures provided the pre-alarm to the external authorities and their 
intervention only in case of alarm confirmation. At 8.45 the pre-alarm concerning the 
first accident was given (external firemen, ""Carabinieri"", prefecture, mayor, port 
authorities). In the same time the internal emergency plan was put in action with the 
internal fire brigade intervention with foam and water extinguishers of various kinds. 
The emergency procedure required the evacuation from the nearby plants of all the 
persons not involved in the extinction efforts, which resulted in sustaining only 
material damages and no personnel injuries.  After the pre-alarm, the persons assigned 
to the emergency, believing the incident has concluded, gave  at 9:25 an ""end of pre-
alarm"" signal to the external authorities, which in the meantime have not intervened. 
In the meantime, for prudence, the state of emergency was maintained inside the 
establishment.  At 9:45, having verified the 2nd event, a 2nd pre-alarm to the external 
authorities was issued: in this case the fire-fighting forces of Cagliari intervened; 
however when they have reached the establishment the 2nd incident was also 
concluded.
Official action taken - other official action: An action of the judicial authority (taken by from the jurists police on behalf of the Attorneys Office of the Republic of Italy in Cagliari) is on course in order to collect information.
","Immediate lessons: In both incidents the human error was of great importance. A first consideration is to 
make the procedures of the training more stringent, repeating them at regular intervals, 
as well as the updating of the responsible personnel to the operations in the plant, 
even for operation considered ""routine"", emphasising the necessity of following to 
the rule, the instructions received and above all the written procedures.
Another consideration consists of the opportunity of making more rigid the security 
processes prescribed for the modification and /or improvement of the plants, in 
particular when external companies are used, when theses operations take place in 
the vicinity of functioning plants, or with operations under work (routine or not), 
adopting a more stringent system for the working permits.
However, because the experience teaches that human errors can happen, although everything is always possible, it would be opportune that some key interventions at the end of the functioning of the security of the plants can not be bypassed, ignored or silenced by the responsible personnel (blockage devices, alarms of extreme intervention, etc.).

428,664,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Chlorine release due to a chlorine-hydrogen explosion in a chlor-alkali electrolysis plant,1995-03-04 00:00:00,1995-03-04 00:00:00,"During chlor-alkali electrolysis an accident occurred in which chlorine was released due to a chlorine-hydrogen explosion: 

The electrolysis of chloro-alkali was performed, as it had been for the previous days, near to the technical capacity. The plant produced 15.6 tonnes chlorine/h and was in normal conditions. There were no evident deviations from the safe operating mode. At the time of the disturbance (accident, failure, breakdown) the shift was manned with a regular crew of 9 persons. The person charged with the control of the measurements was informed by an acoustic signal that a short circuit had occurred in one of the cells. This occurrence is not exceptional and is generally caused by a slight pressure fluctuation in the hydrogen system, which is passed back through the sloping connection between the hydrogen and the chlorine sections. Searching the cause of the increased hydrogen pressure, the controller found immediately out that the hydrogen compressor, which removes all hydrogen from the plant, broke down. He then tried to restart the compressor, which succeeded in the first instance. But short time afterwards, the aggregate broke down again. It is assumed that the low-pressure blocking system caused the break down of the aggregate. The crew observed at that time that a considerable release of hydrogen occurred from the small pipes of the amalgam decomposers. The reason of it is a not sufficient discharge of hydrogen over roof passing through a hydraulic guard foreseen for such cases. This hydraulic guard was set on 70 mm water level and transports the hydrogen without danger over the roof. The container is laid out in accordance with such cases. On the day of the operational disturbance, however, the function of the safety devices was limited (which was not recognized), because a non-irrelevant dirt deposition had formed inside, which increased the counter pressure. Hydrogen reached the cell-space through the mercury pump, which transfers the regenerated mercury again in the electrolytic cell. This fast and massive intrusion of hydrogen caused at least locally the formation of an explosive mixture. The first heavy explosion destroyed a part of the cells as well as the chlorine collection pipe of the new cell-block passing under the explosion point. The plant was shut down by emergency shut down by the crew immediately after the explosion. The after production of hydrogen due to the automatically ongoing decomposition of the amalgam present during that time was not affected by that. Following that, another heavy explosion occurred, which destroyed the externally passing chlorine collection pipe.","Technical error, equipment error (failure of instruments/ accessories).","Three fire fighting officials and one collaborator were slightly injured (affected by irritation of the superior respiratory ducts), after their chlorine gas masks were broken by the power of the explosion. The exposed staff member was also some days under shock. There was also a large material loss.",The plant was immediately shut down after the explosion by the emergency shut down system.,"The aggregate affected was re-designed, avoiding the deposition of dirt (design change). Further, periodic checks are to be performed on it in the future (change in procedure, change in supervision)."
429,185,Other Event,Production and storage of fireworks,Pirotecnica Morsani s.r.l. (IT/NN090),2015-02-28 10:51:00,2015-02-28 16:00:00,"On 28 February 2015, at approximately 10.50 a.m., an explosion occurred in an area of the plant containing a shelter with a floor area of approximately 40&nbsp;m² consisting of a wooden frame with a covering of asbestos cement sheets. The shelter housed a grinding mill (not in use at the time of the explosion) and a concrete mixer used for fine milling charcoal. Carbon dust is used in the production of the colouring mixtures used to make fireworks. According to the operator's statement, the only operation in progress in the area was the fine milling of charcoal. It is presumed that the explosion occurred as a result of ignition of the carbon dust in suspension in the free space of the mixer.","At approximately 10.51&nbsp;a.m., combustible material ignited by the fire swept through an area about 250 m away from the factory entrance. As a result of this, the roofing in the area was damaged.&nbsp;Analysis of the available evidence indicated that the event may have originated from the ignition of a cloud of combustible dust (vegetal carbon dust).There is still uncertainty regarding what caused the dust to ignite. Ruling out inappropriate behaviour by the operators and taking into consideration the favourable weather conditions: a dry, cold winter's day, one possible scenario is that the accumulated static electricity in the clothing of one of the operators may have generated a spark when he was checking on the fineness of the coal dust, thereby triggering the explosion. There was no formal procedure in place stipulating the use of special specific antistatic clothing for that type of processing or requiring that particular attention be paid to equalising the electrical potential between the equipment and the operator before work was carried out on the machine (loading, checking, emptying operations). Looking further into the security management aspects, it was found that the operation was not considered hazardous. The risk of a spontaneous explosion of coal dust was not taken into consideration in the risk analysis carried out.&nbsp;","The explosion, which occurred in the concrete mixer used for milling and located within the shelter, caused the materials making up the structure to be projected to a radius of approximately 15 to 20&nbsp;metres. The remains of the edge of the drum of the concrete mixer involved in the explosion were found, carried by the blast, approximately 130 to 150 metres away, outside the factory, on an adjacent plot of land.&nbsp;Once fire extinguishing operations had been concluded, the remains of the concrete mixer, which had been entirely ripped apart by the explosion, were found in the vicinity of the shelter: in particular, the frame from which the lower part of the drum had completely separated, which had ended up on an adjacent concrete block wall, some wooden floorboards and parts of the wooden structure of the shelter, partially burnt, and a white van damaged by the effects of the explosion.","Following the call to the emergency services registered at 10.51 a.m., the fire brigade, ambulance service and police came to the scene immediately, given their distance from the plant. The authorities intervening at the scene notified the prefecture and judiciary by telephone. Following the security check of the area affected by the event, the Agency department responsible for safety at work intervened. The internal emergency procedure had not been triggered as, when the event occurred, the only employees in the factory were the two individuals involved in the event.The effects of the accident were essentially confined to the areas inside the factory (the part of the mixer drum thrown outside the factory perimeter by the blast did not cause any injuries or accidents). The administrations involved, working together with the Prefecture, set up two of the five road blocks provided for in the external emergency plan (EEP) to ensure access for emergency vehicles. An air ambulance was used to transport the injured workers to hospital, as they required treatment at a major burns unit.
The technical assistance consisted mainly of extinguishing the outbreaks of fire on the wooden structure of the destroyed roof and the remains of the clothing the workers had left on the spot immediately after the explosion. Fire extinguishing and safety checking operations were completed at around 14.05. Then until approximately 16.05, members of the fire brigade and state police established a perimeter around the area affected for the start of the police investigation.","It should be noted that the event occurred in a part of the plant in which the operator, according to the assessments included in the ‘Information sheet for the general public and workers on the risks of a major accident’, had not anticipated any problems. It should further be noted that the substance processed in the area where the accident happened is not listed in Annex I to the Directive. The analysis of the information collected showed that the accident was possible and identifiable. In fact, explosions of combustible dust are events that have been widely studied and consequently the conditions in which they are liable occur have been officially identified. It is therefore possible to foresee the effects of a potential dust explosion and put specific measures in place to prevent both the formation of clouds of suspended dust particles, and the formation and presence of an active source of ignition. In the light of such considerations, work involving the use of combustible powders should have been included in the ‘Risk assessment report: major accident risks and the consequences of major accidents’. The only major accident risk envisaged in that report appears to be that a hypothetical explosion in building B or G would be fatal (0.14 bar) at a distance of up to 173 m, cause irreversible injuries (0.07 bar) at up to 281 m and cause reversible injuries (0.03 bar) at up to 533 m.  The plant’s Safety Management System was reviewed in 2008, 2009 and 2011.
The 2011 review noted that the plant operator, in response to the irregularities detected previously in 2008 and 2009, drew up and established its own Safety Management System that was sufficient to meet the legal requirements. A subsequent on-the-spot check in 2013 showed that the latest instructions had been acted upon and that the operator had taken care to update the Internal Emergency Plan prompted by changes to the company’s organisation chart. The decision to merge the Safety Management System (SMS) (based on the previous technical legislation) with an Occupational health &amp; safety management system (OHSMS) (based on international standard OHSAS 18001) clearly demonstrates the operator’s intention to implement an overall improvement of the Plan."

431,36,Major Accident,Plastic and rubber manufacture,Explosion  in high pressure (3000 bar) production line for low density polyethylene during the start-up,2002-03-22 00:14:00,2002-03-22 00:36:00,"An explosion occurred in a high pressure (3000 bar) production line for low density polyethylene during the start-up of the line.
A recycle line from the high pressure separator ruptured and about 2 tonnes of ethylene and decomposition products were released. The released ethylene caught fire. The fire only burned for a couple of minutes until all ethylene was released through the 124 mm diameter ruptured pipe. Interlock systems had blocked connections to other equipment immediately after the explosion.
The site intervention team started firefighting and cooling down of the equipment. When the fire brigade arrived (15-20 minutes later) the incident was completely under control and no further interventions were needed.
","The decomposition reaction was caused by incomplete purging of the installation, leaving an air pocket in a line.
The air pocket remained between 2 closed valves. One of these valves normally stays open after shut-down and allows the part to be purged. During the shut-down this valve was closed during an interlock test and left closed. The operator performing the purging operation assumed is was still as left at shut down.
The purging operation was done on the basis of operator knowledge, without an instruction.
No checklists were used to guide the start-up process and to mark the completion of start up phases.

Inadequate training of emergency procedures:
There are different emergency buttons available, an emergency stop which stops the installation and isolates all major inventories of ethylene and a dump system to evacuate certain vessels to the (small) flair.
The difference between the systems and when to use which was not understood properly by the operators.
They used the emergency stop (isolating the decomposition reaction) instead of the dump. Dumping the high pressure separator to the flare could have prevented the rupture of the pipe.","Apart from the ruptured pipe the explosion caused structural damage to the nearby platform and damaged weaker construction elements (doors, plastic wall panels) in a wider radius (100-200 m) mostly on-site.

Parts of the pipe had to be replaced due to the high temperature they experienced during the incident.","Official action taken: The company's accident evaluation was followed up by the inspection team. Causes and actions to take were discussed and proved adequate.The installation was shut down and isolated by the emergency stop and interlock systems. This isolated the ruptured pipe and the connected high pressure separator from other equipment.
After the explosion the site intervention team started the firefighting and cooling of the installation, but basically the fire burnt itself out because only the inventory of the high pressure separator was available and all other sources were isolated.
When the fire brigade arrived 15-20 minutes after the explosion the situation was completely under control and all isolated inventories in the installation were one-by-one directed to the flair.","- better, more detailed start up procedures are needed

High level alarm gave insufficient time warning to avoid the tank overtopping and 81121 litres unleaded petrol was lost into the bund. This was recovered for reprocessing without incident or known damage to the environment.","An undetected failure in the tank guaging system led operators
to believe that the starting level in this receiving tank was
approximately 6 m lower than the lower than the actual level.
Consequently an over large parcel of product was planned for transfer.
The independent high level alarm sounded but gave operators
insufficient time to react to avert a spillage. The high level alarm
was not linked to a trip on the pump on the adjacent refinery site.Current safety report
does not give in-depth consideration to vessel overfilling (but does
deal with the same end result of spillage for a tank failure). A review
of tank high level alarm placement and tripping of pumps is needed.

be appropriate.","No adverse health and safety incident occurred, nor is there known to be any environmental damage.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","Product retained with bund and then pumped via fixed pipework back to refinery for reprocessing.

alarm seems to be too high, giving in this instance at a typical
pumping rate of 8944 litres/ minute only 2 half minutes warning before
tank overtopping. Operators took in fact 11 half minutes to stop flow.
The high level alarm is not currently linked to a trip on the pump
itself. Ideally it should be.Measures to prevent recurrence: Daily manual dipping of tanks is now taking place and less reliance is being placed on tank gauges which, like any piece of plant, are subject to failure.  In any case, it seems clear that the tank's high level alarm should be repositioned to give much more warning of impending overfills.  Ideally, the high level alarm should be capable of tripping off the product pump.Measures to mitigate consequences: Once there, the consequences were dealt with well.Useful references: Information suggests that at least one other site, Kingsbury, high level alarms give much more warning and trip off the pump."
433,249,Other Event,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Release of a pool of unleaded gasoline below a tank,2005-04-15 06:30:00,2005-04-15 15:00:00,"At about 6.30am the tankman went to the tank area and noticed a pool of liquid next to tank 7. He immediately alerted his superiors and fire safety section at the nearby power station. The tank was gradually emptied to other tanks and road tankers and the liquid on the ground was covered with foam. If immediate action was not taken to control the release and take precautionary measures, the consequences might have been much worse.

","The suspected cause of the release is a seam failure in the tank bottom. The tank base is filled with concrete and the petrol probably leaked through the tank bottom and came out from two points at the side of the tank. 

","No adverse effects on site or on the environment were reported. The spill was immediately contained. No one was injured. Total cost of fuel lost amounts to about 2000 euros.

","The operator's (Enemalta) fire section was alerted at 7.45am and a fire engine from Delimara power station arrived on site at 7.55am. The Civil Protection Department was alerted and 4 other fire engines arrived on site at 8.15am. Operators started emptying the tank immediately and the pool of petrol on the ground was completely covered  by a foam blanket by 8.30am to minimise evaporation. Pumping of water from the bottom of the tank started at about 9.00am using the on site fire water pump. At around 10.00am the trickle of petrol from the tank was getting smaller and it eventually stopped. At this point no more water was pumped into the tank. This indicates that the crack was so fine that water could not pass through it. By 3.00pm the situation was back to normal.

","This tank had been recently refurbished by reinforcing the tank bottom, internally lining the bottom with epoxy coating and externally painting the shell. A hydrostatic test was then carried out before filling the tank with petrol. After this incident the tank was put out of service. The tank will be cleaned, repaired, a hydrostatic test will be carried out and then a vacuum box test to ensure that there are no cracks.

In these rooms the foam extinguishing equipment and the electric operation equipment pertaining to the storage of mineral oil products are kept. According to the indications of the operator, chemicals, solvents and similar substances were not stored in the cellar rooms. Investigations on the premises established that between the basement of the office building and the tank storage hollow pipes, housing electric leads for the tank storage, were laid underground. In the particular case there are two lines of several hollow pipes each which lead from the basement of the office-building towards the tank storage and end under a platform. Also several hollow pipes coming from the vault manholes of the underground tanks end in this area. Electric cables are laid too in these hollow pipes to the vault manholes. The inspection established that none of these hollow pipes was sealed. Measurements during the investigation on the premises found explosive mixtures in the connecting pipes between the vault manhole and the platform as well as in the area under the platform even several days after the explosion. It has to be assumed that the explosion was caused by explosive mixtures which could reach the basement of the office-building through the unsealed hollow pipes and ignited there through the burner of the heating-installation. Six persons were injured through the explosion and had to be hospitalised. Consistent material loss was caused. Two persons claimed for damages. Measurement of the Fire-brigade at the fire source indicated higher concentrations of benzene, toluene, and hexane. Toluene and hexane are stored in the tank storage, whereas benzene is not. Due to the dimensions of the explosions it has to be assumed that a large amount of explosive mixture had to be involved. It is not clear which kind of chemicals were released and led to the explosion. However there is no evidence of overflowing or leakage of chemicals. No over-ground leakage could be found in the tank installation. On the basis of the investigations leakages in the underground piping system or in the underground tanks cannot be excluded.","Technical error: it has to be assumed that the explosion was caused by explosive mixtures which could reach the basement of the office-building through the unsealed hollow pipes and ignited there through the burner of the heating-installation (missing seals, design inadequacy).","6 on-site injuries, 2 off-site injuries.

- increased pressure,
- an increased fluorine concentration, and
- a relatively high temperature.

All these factors might have been present on the late afternoon of 22&nbsp;September 2020:

- increased pressure caused by the nitrogen cushion;
- an increased fluorine concentration due to the absence of mixing; and

437,1390,Major Accident,Production and storage of fertilizers,Pipeline explosion in ammonia plant,2021-07-07 01:00:00,2021-07-07 02:45:00,"At 01:02, during the start-up manoeuvres of the Ammonia III plant, near the synthesis column, the weld cord breaks over the entire circumference, made between a section of vertical pipe and a connecting elbow with a horizontal pipe. At the breaking of the welding cord, the pressure of the released gas generated the detachment of some metal pipe fixing parts, generating mechanical sparks that ignited the explosive mixture. After igniting the mixture, the burning rate increased explosively, producing: deflagration in the mass of the cloud, pressure wave and a flame front that affected the thermal insulation of the pipes near the cut pipe and generated a thermal radiative field.&nbsp; After the explosion, the flames remained active at the level of the rupture, where the synthesis gas was still released. The Ammonia III plant was shut down immediately, the synthesis loop was depressurized and inertized with nitrogen.  The fire was extinguished&nbsp;in approximately 2 hours&nbsp;by the prompt intervention of firefighters from the internal Service for Emergency Situations (SPSU) Azomures and external firefighters from Mures Inspectorate for Emergency Situations. Details: Given the specificity of ammonia production technology, restarting the plant after a shutdown for a long period of time usually takes about 3 days, most of the phases of the technological process requiring heating and activation of catalysts in a well-defined sequence and procedured at the level of the economic operator. At the time of the event, the last manoeuvres were carried out to complete the process of commissioning the installation and the resumption of the production process and the installation was within normal operating parameters in terms of temperatures, pressures and flow rates, according to the process diagrams recorded in the control room; the syngas parameters were: 73% hydrogen content, pressure 135 bar, temperature 390°C. ","As a result of research conducted by an external investigation team, it was determined that the explosion was caused by the failure of a portion of welding to the coupling of two pipes g as line connecting start up preheater to ammonia reactor. The pipeline is part of a pipeline system authorised by the responsible authority, being technically checked in early 2019 and due for the next periodic technical inspection in early 2022. The ammonia installation 3 was stopped at the end of May 2021 to carry out the scheduled capital overhaul. The revision works were completed on 2 July, and starting from July 3 began the start up manoeuvres of the installation.
The rupture possible causes:&nbsp;
▪Mechanical vibrations of the synthesis column generated by operation at high temperatures and pressures (about 140 Bar)
▪Damage to the mechanical properties of metal pipes as a result of the action of hydrogen under pressure (passing of hydrogen in the metal structure)
▪Change in welding properties between the two pipe sections as a result of exposure to temperature – a clean separation of the two welded sections was found
&nbsp;▪The rupture occurred at the welding of two different materials
▪During plant startup and ammonia reactor heating, high temperature propagates through the line
▪A safety distance from the welding is included by design for the temperature not to reach the welding
▪It is possible that the safety distance was not large enough",One employee was slightly injured at the site (injury caused by broken window fragments from the blast - no hospitalisation required). There was no environmental damage as there were no releases of hazardous substances. Deterioration of the synthesis gas supply pipe of the ammonia synthesis column. Destruction of thermal insulation of other pipes in the fire area. Destruction of the insulation of power lines and AMC instrumentation in the fire area. Thermal and mechanical damage to heat exchangers and ammonia separators. Destruction of two watch cabins for field operators in the proximity of the column. Breaking the windows of the surrounding buildings (administrative building and CET2 building power generation). The cost of damage on the site was estimated at more than 2M &euro;. The Ammonia III plant was closed for 2 years. There were no off-site effects except for blast noise.,"At 01:02 a.m. an explosion followed by fire was reported on the AZOMURES SA site on the single emergency number 112. At the Ammonia III plant, the emergency shutdown procedure was implemented by activating the ESD system, followed by emergency depressurization, nitrogen inerting and isolation of the affected area. At 01:15 the forces (4 officers and 35 non-commissioned officers) and intervention means (3 fire engines, 1 CBRN, 1 tanker, 1 rescue truck, 1 first intervention and command vehicle) of Mures county Inspectorate for Emergency Situations arrived on the site where the Private Service for Emergency Situations (SPSU) Azomures intervened to extinguish the fire with 12 firefighters, the powder and nitrogen truck and fire extinguishers. The dispatcher's coordinating doctor assigned 5 SMURD(Mobile Emergency, Resuscitation and Rescue Service) and 4 SAJ(County Ambulance Service) teams to the scene of the intervention. Measurements were made by the CBRN crew and it was found that there were no leaks of hazardous substances into the atmosphere. At 01:31, as it was found that there were no particular dangers and the situation was under control, a message was sent to the population to prevent panic. At 02:45 the fire was extinguished.","The importance of the correct identification of accident scenarios in the IEP and of the training exercises (an exercise with a similar accident was played in 2020).
The importance of an ESD system it proved its usefulness by stopping the flow of synthesis gas and isolating the affected pipe portion.
The importance of SOP for emergency situations and field operators training SOP in place and well trained operators very good reaction times.
The importance of high focus on process safety (more focus on the design; check if the material specification fits for all operating modes - including starting and shut down).
Improving the inspections / inernal audit / mentenance of pipelines and vessels.
Communication during emergency situations.
Following the analysis of the intervention mode and other low-probability but high-impact scenarios in the EEP (massive ammonia spills), the intervention of off-site firefighters mode needs to be re-examined and re-thought taking into account that in the worst-case scenario, drivers cannot drive the intervention vehicles using their heavy protective equipment on.

440,826,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Large ammonia release in an ammonia injector installation of an urea production plant in an organic chemical industry,1989-07-06 15:00:00,1989-07-06 00:00:00,"ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:On-site wind speed variable between 12.9-16.4 mph (5.8-7.3 m/s). Wind direction variable between 60°-90°. The atmospheric stability was assessed as Pasquill category ""D"".ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:At 15:30 the crankcase of an URACA horizontal action 3 throw pump, used to boost liquid ammonia pressure from 300 psi to 3,400 psi, was punctured by fragments of the failed pump-ram crankshaft. The two operators investigating the previously reported noises from the pump were engulfed in ammonia and immediately overcome by fumes. Once the pump crackcase was broken, nothing could be done to prevent the release of the contents of the surge drum (10 tonnes were released in the first three minutes). The supply of ammonia from the ring main could only be stopped by switching off the supply pump locally. No one were able to do this as the two gas-tight suits available were preferentially used for search and rescue operations, and thus release of ammonia continued.&nbsp; Ammonia fumes quickly began to enter the plant control room and the operators hardly had the time to sound the alarms and start the plant shut-down before they had to leave the building using 10 minutes escape breathing apparatus sets. During the search and rescue operation the fire authorities did not use the gas-tight suits and fumes entered the gaps around the face piece and caused injuries to 5 men. The ammonia cloud generated by the initial release drifted off-site and remained at a relatively low level.The supply of ammonia from the ring main could only be stopped by switching off the supply pump locally. No one were able to do this as the two gas-tight suits available were preferentially used for search and rescue operations, and thus release of ammonia continued. Ammonia fumes quickly began to enter the plant control room and the operators hardly had the time to sound the alarms and start shutting down the plant before they had to leave the building using 10-minutes escape breathing set. The on-site emergency plan was activated within minutes of the alarm being sounded; a roll call quickly established that only two men were missing. The two gas-tight suits were used to search and rescue rather than to isolate the ammonia ring supply. The isolation of the main ring was achieved 40 minutes after the start of the release: in this period of time 28 tonnes of ammonia (in addition to the 10 tonnes initially released) escaped to the atmosphere.",INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The catastrophic failure of an URACA liquid ammonia pump caused the release of pressurized liquid ammonia. The initial release of 10 tonnes in the first 3 minutes (the contents of the surge drum) was followed by 28 tonnes in the subsequent 40 minutes until the ammonia ring main was isolated.CAUSES:The crankshaft of the Uraca pump failed catastrophically smashing itself through the crankcase. Failure of the crankshaft was due to to the propagation of a fatigue crack through the web separating the first and second crank pins. Metallurgical investigations found no initiating defect leading to crack propagation. It is thought that the failure was due to some overload of the web/crank pin radius at some unknown time. No inspections were foreseen for this component.&nbsp; The pump design was not adequate (code 5308).,"EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:3,000 on-site people were exposed. 2 operators were immediately killed by the toxic release (they were investigating previously reported noises from the pump when the leak happened and they were surrounded by fumes). 5 members of the fire brigades were injured by ammonia because they did not use gas-tight suits and fumes entered the gaps around the face pieces of the suits.About 50,000 off-site people were exposed to the fumes (up to 7 km away) but nobody was seriously affected. Some mothers and children were affected by fumes while making their way home.MATERIAL LOSS:No significant material damages occurred except to the URACA pump.OUTSIDE THE ESTABLISHMENTThe ammonia cloud generated by the initial release drifted off-site and remained at a relatively low-level. On the basis of the described effects and of post accident predictions, it was evaluated that ammonia concentration was about 150 ppm for 10 minutes at 3.5 km reducing to 50 ppm for 15 minutes at 7 km from the leak source. On a map attached to the Original Report is shown the path made by the toxic cloud vs the time from the beginning of the accident.Local radio warnings were given but this was too late for some local schools. Some mothers and children were affected while making their way home (the accident occurred at about 15:30).Disruption of community life: The off-site emergency plan was activated within 5 minutes of the start of the release. Local radio warned off-site population.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The operators of the plant control room, before to leave the building using 10 minutes escape breathing apparatus sets because ammonia fumes began to enter the room, hardly had time to sound the alarms and to start the plant shut-down. The on-site emergency plan was activated within minutes of the alarm being sounded. A roll call quickly established that only 2 men were missing and a decision was made to use the 2 gas-tight suits for search and rescue in preference to isolate the ammonia ring main supply.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The off-site emergency plan was activated within 5 minutes of the start of the release. Local radio warnings were given but this was too late for some local schools and some mothers and children were affected while making their way home.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- existing similar pumps to be thoroughly examined and fitted with crankshaft deflection devices;
2- older design crankshafts to be replaced with new crankshafts (differences in the material of construction and crank pin radius);
3- critical plant machinery to be identified and subjected to a regime of inspection similar to that applied to pressure vessels.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, it was established that automatic remotely operated shut-off valves have to be fitted to liquid ammonia supply systems so that a hazardous piece of the plant can be isolated quickly and the amount of the ammonia (eventually released in case of an accident) reduced."

There was the danger to involve a nearby depot of the Federal Army. very dry weather, sunny day with 30 degrees Celsius, sudden wind, wood fire type IV.
In connection with a technologically suitable burn-up of propellant powder, a wildfire suddenly occurred on a licensed fire place. As a result of the rising wind, the flames spread to the area adjacent to the fire place in a northerly direction. The fire place is permanently equipped with appropriate fire extinguishing tools. As a precaution, pressure hoses with coupled steel pipes are available in front of two hydrants. The fire was reported to the plant security immediately after it was recognized by an operator of the fire site on the basis of the company's fire alarm regulations. Another operators present at the fire site immediately started firefighting with the steel pipes ready. The plant security department alerted the fire department. After the conflagration was under control, the area was adequately extinguished and watered.

The establishment is classified as Seveso Upper Class. The accident is classified as level 4 on the international accident gravity scale.

Considering the material damage, which was high, the criterion in Annex VI is exceeded: the accident has to be notified to the European database (MARS).The accident:A fire associated with muffled explosions started in the refinery at 21:15, involving the desulphurising section of the ""crackert No. 7"". The fire continued until 15:12 of 4 September. The accident chronology was as follows:* 21:12: rupture of a 3/4 inch tapping (connection) on the suction pipe of pump P3B,* 21:12 + 30 s: ignition of the cloud (about 200 kg of the substance) and creation of a (combustible) fed torch fire ,*21:13: rupture of a 3-inch mineral oil pipe which was exposed to the torch fire,&nbsp; creating another fire jet of larger size,*21:18: by domino effect,&nbsp; rupture of the collector of a cooling tower and ignition of the released substance,* 21:22: - by domino effect effect, rupture of the&nbsp; 8-inch head pipe&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; column V3, ignition of the release,&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - by domino effect, rupture of column V3 valves collector, which is connected to the site's flare system, and ignition of the released gas. This caused a partial release to the atmosphere&nbsp; from the site's flare system.* From 22:00 onwards: The ignited releases kept on burning until the material being processed in the unit was exhausted and the flare system could be isolated without risk, an operation which was completed on 4 September at 15:15 hrs.","The causes of the accident are related to a system constituted of ""steam turbine + pump"" (Ref. P3B). Actually, the accident occurred during a periodical test phase carried out with this equipment, which constitutes an emergency relief unit for the P3A pump.Various investigations carried out after the accident, have led to the identification of a complex of factors which may have caused the accident itself. The causes which may have brought about the accident according to the various reports issued on this subject are collected below:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Presence of condensates in the turbine (closed bleeder valve),.....* Inadequate anchoring of the frame to the foundation,.....* Inadequate lubrication of the pump's bearing assembly,.....* Design of the pump rotor,.....* Cavitation phenomena of the pump, the aspiration capacity being inadequate,.....* Anomalies in the bearings' refrigeration system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These factors caused:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - strong vibrations of the pump, which caused&nbsp; fatigue stressing and consequently the rupture of a 3/4 inch tapping&nbsp; (connection) placed just above the pump,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - a misalignment of the turbine and the pump, which caused a fracture of the shaft and a deterioration of the coupling.An event&nbsp; which contributed to the gravity of the accident was identified. An anomalous delay (of about 10 min) in the closing of the block valve of the feeding pipe of the P3B pump. Actually, if the closing of this valve, which was controlled by the automatic safety system, had been completed within the normal time (of about one minute), the domino effects which involved the other pipe networks could have been avoided, substantially reducing the gravity of the accident.","The accident caused minor injuries to one person.There was no significant environmental impact, and the extinguishing water has been stored in a 60.000 m3 buffer tank designed this purpose.The accident has caused a 7-month shutdown of the unit. The material damage amounts to about 13.72 Meuros (13.720.000 euros) for repairs and 68.6 Meuros (68.600.000 euros) for production loss.","The emergency response operations in this accident were carried out by the on-site fire fighting service of the refinery, supported by the neighbouring city's fire brigade.The fire fighting strategy was based on reducing the risk of fire propagation and cooling the structures which were exposed to thermal radiation, in order to prevent a possible collapse. However, at the climax of the fire large water delivery rates were employed (of the order of 2300 m3/h, with a pressure of 7 to 8 bar, supplied by the extinguishing system of the installation).Following the accident, an decree for urgent measures has been issued by the Departement's prefect, on 4 September 2000, requiring the operator to:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; provide a list of the equipment affected by the accident,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; provide an accident report including a report on measures for preventing recurrence of similar accidents,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; provide a report on the operational status of the equipment .The same decree states also that the start-up of the installations involved in the accident has to be authorised by the regional prefect. During the discussions which followed, the following requirements emerged:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * evaluation of the operator's accident report by a third-party expert,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * implementation of a systematic and methodical inspection program, in order to assess the state of the equipment.After an examination of the neighbouring installations, the operator declared that only the ""No. 7 cracking"" unit had been significantly affected.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following method has been chosen to assess the state of the equipment involved:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * As a first step, a (methodical and systematic) inspection plan has been prepared. This inspection plan has been approved by the expert who in this context was employed also by the insurance companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * This inspection plan has been implemented for the totality of the equipment which may have been affected by the accident;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The implementation of this inspection plan has made it possible to prepare a&nbsp; classification of the equipment according to its operability.Taking in&nbsp; consideration the elements mentioned above, the inspectorate has recorded the classification, as submitted by mail, which was obtained by each piece of equipment after implementation of this inspection plan; the inspectorate also reminded the operator that the various construction and repair operations involving the equipment must be carried out in compliance of the rules of good practice and while strictly complying with the relevant regulations.","The following corrective measures have been proposed by the operator: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Change of pump type and modification of the vertical alignement of the column, in order to avoid cavitation phenomena;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Replacement of the motor-driven valves placed in the pipes feeding the P3A and P3B pumps, in order to reduce the shutting delay, the declared objective of Total being a shut-off delay below 30s;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Modification of the turbine's speed regulation system into an ""isochronous"" regulation system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Replacement of the 3/4 inch tapping (connection)&nbsp; of the involved pumps by 1 inch tapping&nbsp; (connection), provided with reinforcement gussets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Modification of the drainage system of the turbines involved;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Implementation of a campaign aiming to increase worker's awareness of the importance of a strict application of operating procedures during the heat-up phase of turbines.These proposals were approved by the third-party expert, who has independently prepared some additional recommendations.With reference to these different expert assessments, the Departement's prefect has authorised the new start-up of the unit, the authorisation being subject to the condition of the operator's compliance with additional requirements (complementary decree of 27 March 2001)."

The liquid gas feed pumps were inoperative too, so that at the external temperature conditions (approx. -5 C°) the pressure on the overflow valve was only the static pressure of the liquid gas pipe. Therefore the overflow valve opening function was not activated.The characteristics of the damage (a crack with a length of 12 mm in the longitudinal direction of the bellows) together with an evaluation of the local situation as well as the situation in the establishment indicate that the most probable cause is a imperfect manufacture or a defect in the material.",A fireman suffered minor frostbite on one hand.,"After the onset of the failure (accident), the shut-off valves were closed and the remaining gas was flared. The defective overflow valve was removed and the pipe was blocked with a blind flange (sealing plate).
Outside of the installation, roads were blocked and gas measurements were carried out; moreover, extinguishing water was prepared.","Since the failure of a  bellows used to seal a valve cannot be excluded, a secondary protection should be present. Such a secondary protection against the release of substances can be realised structurally by a supplementary gasket on the valve spindle (valve shaft) or by a gas-proof spring housing shell.
The required safety and reliability of overflow / control valves could be guaranteed by a component test, similar to a safety valve test."
447,215,Major Accident,Other activity (not otherwise specified int the list),Fire and explosion to warehouse,2010-11-05 13:00:00,2010-11-09 14:00:00,"At about 1pm on 5th November a fire started on a pallet in Warehouse 9. Personnel working in the immediate vicinity attempted to extinguish the fire but quickly realised that aerosol containers were beginning to fail and evacuated the building. The fire was contained in Warehouse 9, although there were some road closures. The main heat of the fire declined by late evening but was not finally extinguished until Monday 7th November. No-one was hurt during the incident and no offsite injuries or health effects have been reported. There were environmental consequences due to surfactant contamination of the River Skerne causing foaming and minor fish death, insufficient in scale to constitute a major accident to the environment. However, it is clear that some organic material was also released to ground during the incident.","Not possible to confirm due to substantial fire damage however most likely explanation for the fire (by elimination of other causes) was a collision from an electrical powered fork truck with a pallet of aerosols. It is likely this involved a FLT reversing into the pallet, although the FLT driver may not have been aware of this due to the size of the truck, which along with the other FLTs operated in relatively narrow aisles. The collision would release LPG vapour which was then ignited, with the FLT potentially acting as a source of ignition. The FLT was not specifically designed for use in hazardous / zoned areas reflecting the fact that the warehouse had not been established as a zoned area. The fire was discovered by a fork truck operator.
Organisational:
The potential risk of operating relatively large FLTs within narrow aisles had not been recognised.
Human:
Not possible to confirm however the most likely explanation of the fire is a FLT driver reversing into a pallet of aerosols causing damage and a release of LPG vapour which was subsequently ignited. Owing to the size of the FLT it could be possible for the FLT driver not to be aware of the damage caused.
&nbsp;",Total destruction of the warehouse.,Full emergency response.&nbsp;On site and off site plans invoked.,"No direct lessons learned by the operator who has withdrawn from warehousing aerosols. They had previously conducted a gap analysis against the accepted industry guidance on the storage of aerosols in warehouses and found themselves broadly compliant. Whilst further risk reduction measures had been identified including caging of aerosols and fitting of a deluge system they had been rejected following a cost benefit analysis. They had however decided to replace their FLTs with ones rated for use in a zoned area when the time came to renew their FLT fleet, which had been planned for a future date. The speed with which the incident escalated was not previously foreseen which highlighted the importance to consider additional control measures in any situation where rapid escape may be difficult e.g. working in raised platforms, scissor lifts, man aloft FLTs etc. This is now reflected in the associated trade industry guidance."
448,871,Major Accident,Processing of metals using electrolytic or chemical processes,Fire in an electroplating plant,2009-05-12 12:15:00,2009-05-12 00:00:00,"The fire broke out as a result of build-up of heat following overheating of part of a high-voltage power cable in a poorly ventilated cable duct.There was a series of individual causes the combination of which resulted in the fire breaking out and propagating. The fire was not caused by combustible liquids (lubrication solvents). There was no short-circuit or failure of or defect in any part of the plant, consequently the plant's control system was not activated or able to resolve the problem.The fire was propagated by certain features of the premises itself (type of air inlet, type of cable bushings, unavoidable fire loads in the form of synthetic tanks and piping, cable ducts and glass-fibre reinforced gratings, a bitumen roofing material which melted with the heat of the smoke being emitted and resulted in burning bitumen being spread around).Clear steam was first noticed coming from the zinc bath area, then dark smoke. The fire then spread very quickly. Much more water than expected was needed to tackle the fire and this water could not be completely retained. Some of the water used to extinguish the fire escaped from the inner part of the electroplating plant into an underground gallery and had to be pumped out.","System faults/Design:It is assumed that the sporadic increase of the transition impedances led to the uneven distribution of the electrical current to the existing power cables and to the partial heating of one cable.In addition to the heat that accumulated in the cable tray, more heat was added due to the structural situation (nearby hot water pipes). This process could already have gone on over a longer period without noticeable problems in the production process and without process variables being exceeded. The long-term heating led to the formation of flammable vapours from the present organic materials until the ignition temperature was reached.",Fire resulting in destruction and severe sooting of a large part of the electroplating facility and roof. Some sooting in the ancillary rooms.,"Affected area and adjacent buildings evacuated: the fire was reported to the Berlin fire brigade by the control office. Automatically by the fire alarm at 12.19, by employees at 12.21 (alert button). ","The accident investigation report noted that the cause of the fire was not a plant-specific problem and that it was not due to a malfunction of the plant. In order to avoid a similar partial heating of a single power cable in the future, among others the following proposals were made which need to be considered particularly in the plant design:* Sufficient dimensioning of cable conduits and their ventilation.* Installation of power cables following VDE 0298 Part 4 “Use of cables and insulated lines for high-voltage systems” in particular in the case of retrofitting.* Sufficient space for retrofitting.* Closure of cable lead-throughs for fire protection.* Respecting of adequate distances between cable conduits and hot-water- and other hot lines, especially when retrofitting.* Monitoring/Checking of complete heat insulation of hot pipes.* Documenting of all changes made to the plant.* Monitoring all connections for unevenly distributed currents in single lines to avoid uneven heating when in operation.* Periodic checking of all connections and sleeves/closures of extended cables for unusual heating with a thermal imaging camera.* Avoidance of additional heat accumulators and fire loads on cable conduits."
449,1126,Major Accident,"Waste storage, treatment and disposal",Fire in a waste recovery and disposal facility,2017-08-08 17:10:00,2017-08-11 08:00:00,"In the evening of 8 August 2017, a fire broke out at a facility for the temporary storage of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and for treatment (in this case transfer of liquid waste only).The response teams of the competent fire brigades attended the scene immediately and were able to bring the fire under control during the night of 8 to 9 August 2017. The remaining ember nests were then monitored.The latter were the cause of a new outbreak of fire on 10 August 2017. However, this incident was very localised and less intense.
In an outdoor area to the northwest of the storage box system, there were containers that were empty but for residue (waste code 15 01 10 – butyl chloride; deposits on the container walls, as they are not rinsed or washed out), which melted due to the intense heat. During the fire extinguishing work on the newly ignited fire, the deposits then reacted with water, resulting in gas formation.
One building was affected by the event, along with the open storage boxes located on the western side and the immediately adjacent outdoor spaces in front of the access routes to each of the storage boxes.The roofing over the storage boxes collapsed due to the intense heat.The hazardous materials store and the office and staff rooms were not damaged.
There were a total of 11 casualties with minor injuries, such as skin irritation/rashes, and significant damage to property. A large amount of smoke was generated.Residents were therefore urged to close windows and doors. The fire brigade then carried out emission measurements over a wide area. It was established that there was no risk to humans and the environment.In addition, the fire brigades involved had only limited operational capability after the major operation, as some of the equipment was no longer usable and had to be replaced.
Safety measures:The fire alarm system was triggered. An employee had already reported the fire by telephone.","According to the Criminal Police, this was a case of spontaneous combustion.",The covered storage box system and two open-air boxes were burned out.Off-site:Contamination of the retention basins in the chemical park with fire-fighting water.,"Measures for the retention of fire-fighting water and fire-fighting.

A composite IBC containing a 90:10 cyclohexane–ethyl acetate solvent mix was lifted by a forklift truck for transfer, positioned above a metallic drum, and the solvent mix transferred from the IBC to the drum by the action of gravity.
Safety measures:

A member of staff pressed the emergency button as soon as the fire broke out.
The incident command of the on-site fire brigade arrived at the site very quickly (after approximately 1&nbsp;minute).
Arrival of the on-site fire brigade after approximately 4&nbsp;minutes and immediate initiation of the firefighting operation; containment of the fire in the ground floor area.
Arrival of the local fire brigade; handover of overall command and continuation of the firefighting work by the on-site fire brigade.
Convening of the site incident command by the duty plant manager.
Closure of the inlet and outlet weirs of the circulation ditch while firefighting foam was being used.
","Ignition source: electrostatic.The fire is very likely to have been caused by ignition of the solvent as a result of electrostatic discharge. During the expert inspection, it was found that, although equipotential bonding had been carried out between the filled drum and the IBC, there was no earthing to the ground/room. As a result, the system as a whole could build up an electrostatic charge. Use was also made of an extension tap consisting of a metallic pipe bend screwed to the IBC by means of a plastic insulating adapter. Here too, a dangerous electrostatic charge could build up.","Damage to the production building and destruction of the production facility. Costs: EUR&nbsp;3,400,000.
Soil contamination.Low-level impact on the unpaved embankment behind the production building as a result of contaminated firefighting foam.","Water:Closure of the inlet and outlet weirs of the circulation ditch while firefighting foam was being used.The firefighting foam used to fight the flames in the production building as the fire progressed flowed out of the building through the entrance doors and into a slotted drain, from where it ran into the underground reception pit. While the firefighting work was still ongoing, a disposal company was brought in for disposal purposes. It pumped approximately 75&nbsp;t of water from the drain and the underground reception pit and collected it in IBCs.Water samples were also taken by the Land Agency for Nature, the Environment and Consumer Protection [Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz – LANUV]. Samples were taken from both the fire-extinguishing water and the circulation ditch. The LANUV laboratory found evidence of perfluorinated surfactant (PFS) / perfluorooctane sulphonic acid (PFOS) contamination in the water samples tested.
Soil:Soil samples were taken in the area around the embankment of the circulation ditch, by the production building. Removal of 20–30&nbsp;cm of the embankment, as a result of contamination with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
Emptying, cleaning and dismantling of the production facility in the production building. Disposal of contaminated raw materials and products. Securing and cleaning of the production building.

Technical/organisational:Relocation of further processing of cyclohexane to another production building, in a mixer with monitored earthing, and dilution with ethanol to increase conductivity.
Organisational:The standard instructions on correct earthing have been completely revised and updated. One shortcoming was that the training documentation on electrostatics in the documentation and training system was flawed and contained a statement that was fully implemented by the member of staff in the production building, namely equipotential bonding of the containers.Unfortunately, however, it was not shown that, as well as being equipotentially bonded, the containers also have to be earthed.A training document has been completely redrafted, clearly showing what correct earthing looks like.
In addition to the training documentation, the operating instructions have also been amended accordingly, e.g. ‘Explosion prevention in packaging’."
451,618,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Rupture of a ball valve shaft installed on the liquid outlet pipe of the tank,2002-02-05 07:45:00,2002-02-05 10:00:00,Rupture of a ball valve shaft installed on the liquid outlet pipe of the tank.,"The valve was old; the wear on  the valve thread caused the release of LPG in liquid phase. The valve had never been serviced.The event was caused by the sudden ejection of the control shaft of the ball valve while opening the valve. The failure was caused by the age of the valve, and the probable wear of the bush thread, the valve was constructed in 1966 (installed in 1967). The rupture of the control shaft caused the release of LPG under pressure (approx. 5 kg/cm2) through the cylindrical opening formed by the control shaft housing of the valve. A total amount of 15,000 to 16,000l of LPG corresponding to approximately 8 tons of product were released.","A gas cloud formed.
There was no immediate effect because the cloud did not ignite.
Area concerned - Remarks: The accident occurred in the East South-East area of the storage installation located between the refinery and the beach.People - Remarks:The worker who was opening the valve was thrown to the ground and suffered bruising without serious consequences.Material Loss - Remarks:Damage is limited to the loss of the product and to loss of production (shutting down time of the installation)Affected Area: installationAffected Area: off-site: local","The on-site emergency plan was activated involving the nearby refinery, with monitoring of the gas cloud, the off-site emergency plan was activated involving the fire brigade, the prefecture, the municipality and the police forces, the personnel not needed for the emergency response operations were evacuated.Emergency measures - Remarks: The first emergency measure taken by the on-site emergency response service and the emergency response personnel of the neighbouring installations Saras and Polimeri Europa was to dilute and confine the gas cloud with water sprays. In particular the personnel of Saras stationed themselves externally on the southern part with monitors and installed water curtains fed by the refinery water network, while the personnel of Polimeri Europa positioned themselves externally on the eastern part of the installation with sprays fed by with a water tender.The first fire brigade team arrived at 8:05 hrs and substituted the personnel of the installation in the response operations.Subsequently water was pumped through the pipe coming from the Saras refinery, usually used for transferring LPG from the refinery into the storage tanks. The water was pumped at a higher pressure than the pressure inside the tank (approximately 5 kg/cm2), so as to displace the LPG in the bottom of the tank and substitute it in the leakage.This measure allowed&nbsp; the surrounding area to be made secure by 9:30 hrs and to approach the ruptured valve and seal it by 10:00 hrs.The LPG remaining in the tank was then transferred to another adjacent tank.The off-site emergency plan was activated.Discussion about response: The environmental conditions in which the accident developed were such that the employment of all foreseen emergency response means was possible, thus avoiding the evolution of the accident event.
The accident analysis showed that pumping water into the tank was a very effective measure. 
The accident was caused by the rupture of a ball valve shaft installed on the liquid outlet pipe of the tank which was ejected from its seat while opening the valve. The valve had been installed at the time the installation was built, 35 years earlier; therefore the substitution of these valves should be more frequent.
","Immediate Lessons: Similar valves were substituted also on the other tanks, the new valves installed have an improved safety design (better technology), the refurbishing operations of the installation were brought forward."

The warehouse houses surface treatment lines and paint booths. The activation of the smoke detectors alerted the fire brigade. A large number of chemicals were present at the plant, increasing the risk of the fire spreading and generating thick smoke which complicated the work of the emergency services. The fire brigade set up two roof-mounted hoses, then two additional hoses and a foam hose. The fire was brought under control at 10:25.
The part of the workshop housing the surface treatment lines and tanks was destroyed. The damage to property is estimated at EUR 11 million. Thirty-five people have been furloughed and the shutdown of the workshop responsible for a key stage of the process could put at risk the entire activity of the site, which employs 10,000 people. 650 m³ of firefighting water was recovered in the basin provided for that purpose. In the evening, when the basin was full, the operator decided to discharge 200 m³ of contaminated water exceeding the zinc emission limit value in order to maintain retention capacity in the event of a failure of the secondary containment for tanks of surface treatment products that presented a much greater environmental hazard. The retention basin was treated by the decontamination station on site. The secondary containment and other polluted areas were pumped out by a specialist company. The operator carried out measurements of hydrocyanic acid every 30 minutes in order to be able to ask the fire brigade to close the area in the event of an anomaly. Piezometric monitoring of groundwater quality was established on site, as well as off-site sampling to assess the impact of the incident (soil and surface samples).
The fire was caused by an electrical fault, either in an electrical control cabinet located near to the treatment chain or directly on one of the treatment lines. That fire then spread to the rest of the installation via the plexiglas anti-splash panels, acid vapour exhaust ducts and bath tanks. It developed primarily by convection, facilitated by the draught caused by the acid vapour exhaust system and the significant fuel potential around it. The absence of smoke detectors in the area of the surface treatment chains, the limited heat and smoke venting in the room and the design of the ceiling were factors contributing to the development of the fire before the alarm was raised.","The fire was caused by an electrical fault, either in an electrical control cabinet located near to the treatment chain or directly on one of the treatment lines.

Once the stock in the buffer tank was exhausted, an operative activated the transfer pump and opened the check valve of the corresponding tank. A hydraulic shock occurred as a result of the vacuum caused by the pump starting before the valve had been opened. A bend downstream of the valve detached from its PVC piping. The tank partially supplied the production line, but emptied partially into the bund via the detached bend until the accident was discovered by the patrol 2 hours later.","Four months previously, the operator had abolished the night team specifically responsible for transferring products between the storage tanks and the packing lines.
Once the stock had been exhausted in the buffer tank, one of the operatives had to go to the building housing the storage depot control station at around 22:00. From the control desk, he started the transfer pump then opened the check valve on the corresponding tank. A hydraulic shock occurred as a result of the vacuum caused by the pump starting before the valve had been opened. A bend downstream of the valve detached from its PVC piping. The tank partially supplied the production line, but emptied partially into the bund via the detached bend until the accident was discovered by the patrol 2 hours later. The bund sensor malfunctioned and did not trigger a visual alarm at the site guard house. The investigation has revealed that there were no operating instructions or instructions for transfer operations, despite the production team not being trained in the use of the transfer control station (a task previously carried out by a specialised team). Once the transfer was launched, no one remained in the building housing the control station to monitor the smooth operation of the transfer remotely. The control station display did not show the position of the valve at the base of the tank, which could have alerted the operative to the risk of water hammer in the transfer pipes. The working of the transfer pump was not linked to the correct opening of the tank check valves nor to the detection of low levels in tanks. Once the leak was detected, staff did not activate the balloon plug for the site’s sewerage systems, contrary to the instructions in place.","The bund was not watertight and 30 l of product accumulated in a trough upstream of the rainwater system. The product remaining in the bund was pumped into an empty container while the leak from the bund was blocked. A small mobile pump was used to pump the product in the network into an empty container urgently retrieved from the refuse.

456,913,Near Miss,Chemical installations - chlorine,Accidental release of phosgene in a chemical plant,2012-05-14 23:50:00,2012-05-14 12:00:00,"Around 10:30 pm in the isocyanate unit at a Seveso-classified chemical plant, a sensor detected a rapid conductivity rise in a heat exchanger, in which phosgene (COCl2) pressurised to tens of bar was being reheated with water vapour at 28 bar before reacting with an amine. Once the sensor alarm threshold was reached (50 µS), the safety controller isolated the drainage circuit for exchanger condensates by closing a motorised valve. A second conductivity meter, which had not been functioning properly and was scheduled for replacement by maintenance staff, displayed a value of 0 µS. Uninformed of this malfunction, technicians decided to shut off the amine intake at 10:40 pm and extract a sample to confirm their suspicions; they notified the on-call operator, who carried out an on-site assessment of the situation at 11 pm. The operator then proceeded to bypass the conductivity meter in restarting production without waiting for laboratory results to be released.
Around 11:30 that evening, external sensors detected a COCl2 concentration build-up. By 11:52, a pressure sensor on the vapour circuit was reading in the tens of bar, triggering shutdown of the unit by closing shutoff valves on both the enclosure confining the unit and the condensate drainage circuit. The quick sequence of these closure steps caused a water hammer that broke a drainage valve at the base of the exchanger; the remaining COCl2 spilled into the enclosure, lowering vacuum pressure and closing the exchanger bypass valves. COCl2 sensors inside the confinement detected a rise in COCl2 content, reaching saturation at 1:10 am (1,000 ppm). A tube opened inside the exchanger and a large quantity of COCl2 spread into the vapour circuit with pressure increasing rapidly. Before the circuit could be closed as a safety precaution, a small amount of gas escaped via the soda tank drainage circuit, whose buffer (lid) had not been sealed following an improper reassembly step. The COCl2 discharged into the atmosphere in the time it took to isolate the enclosure wound up saturating the outside detectors (2 ppm), with measured concentrations gradually declining until 12:25 am","An expert appraisal of the leaky tube revealed the presence of acid corrosion accelerated by Cl- hydrolysis during shutdown periods. A break in the seal on an exchanger tube had caused a small COCl2 leak within the vapour circuit along with a rise in condensate conductivity due to COCl2 hydrolysis into HCl. Unit restart served to accelerate corrosion via HCl from the leaky tube until pressure burst it open: 700 kg of COCl2 spilled into the enclosure and 14 kg into the atmosphere while isolating the enclosure, as well as from the soda tank. Moreover, the sampling system on the 2nd conductivity meter had shown recurrent signs of malfunction subsequent to flow rate interruptions (this problem was known to the maintenance department yet not shared with operations personnel).
Only successful implementation of the 2nd safety barrier (pressure sensor and its safety chain, in addition to integrated enclosure confinement) avoided the discharge of a large quantity of toxic gas outside the site boundary (with dwellings as close as 260 m).","Between 1 and 3 am, 4 technicians of the unit working outside experienced a slight intoxication and were sent to the site's infirmary.",The confined gases were neutralised on a scrubber column until the enclosure was free of all COCl2 during early afternoon,"The 2nd conductivity meter was repaired and a flow alarm installed on the sampler; also, the condensate drainage circuit was inspected and all equipment damaged by the acidic atmosphere (caused by COCl2 hydrolysis) in the enclosure was replaced. The seal on the soda tank lid was checked and the tank pumping procedure modified to avoid the opening of the lid. Other procedures were formalised or consolidated, namely:
- instructions in case of activation of the unit's technical safety barriers: conductivity meter, pressure sensor, etc.;
- Bypass of the unit's technical barriers: awareness-building for both technical staff and managers, definition of each team member's roles and responsibilities, clarification and restriction of authorised bypass conditions;
- Conditions applicable to unit technician certification regarding both process safety and equipment inspection;
- Frequency of conductivity meter calibration (shortened from 6 to 3 months);
- Formalisation of information/feedback loops among operations teams and the online analyser maintenance department.
The Classified Facilities Inspectorate asked the site operator to review the criteria adopted for activating the internal emergency plan and better inform staff of the role played by technical safety barriers, as even backup barriers did not justify bypassing a barrier without first analysing the compensatory measures that would eventually need to be implemented."

The electro-plating plant is located on the ground-floor of the hangar whereas a transformer-room (switch cabinet room) fed by a 20 kV line is located on the second floor. A fire spread from the low voltage switch cabinet over to 9 other low voltage switch cabinets. A series of high voltage cabinets located in the same room were partially damaged. Alarm was triggered by the fire alarm system. Fire extinguishing operations could be performed only after shutting down the high voltage feed.
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Initially fire fighting operations started from outside of the room. Penetrating the room at that time was not possible due to the fact that the high voltage power supply to the room still had not been shut down.

Factors such as operating and maintenance competencies, introduction of new technology (in this case automation of the de-waxing cycle) and human error (unfamiliarity with new equipment). The importance of following prevention procedures relating to control incidents is also reinforced (in this case equipment preparation for maintenance).Further measures:A comprehensive incident investigation was conducted with a representative team comprising a senior engineer, operations supervisor, health and safety representative, project engineer, safety management system coordinator and lead by a trained incident investigation leader. Refresher training was provided to project and surveillance technical support personnel on project changes and documentation requirements. Additional training was provided for personnel operating and maintaining the new prover. The training refreshed aspects of the prover operation and provided additional details for the automatic de-waxing cycle sequencing which is an aspect of the operation not immediately apparent to users of the equipment. Refresher training was provided to technicians on work management practices, including equipment preparation for maintenance, job planning and hazard assessment.
Previous risk assessments were reviewed and found to be appropriate. The project risk assessments had identified the potential for a spill (low likelihood) but took a conservative approach in any event by providing a concrete bund although it was not mandated. The project implementation system was reviewed to ensure provision of training to address secondary components (those not obvious) prior to commissioning equipment. The following company controls worked well:

Basic Technician competencies in operating process equipment when managing the incident response.
Design, risk assessment and controls (layers of protection) for the new prover, which provided for the installation of a bund.
Workforce involvement and consultation during project development and incident investigation.
Incident response, containment and clean-up.

460,838,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Release of natural gas occurred in a low pressure 4 lift water sealed holder,1991-12-14 10:00:00,1991-12-14 00:00:00,"No 5 gas holder was commissioned on December 3, 1991 to allow for winter demand patterns. On December 12, the steam antifreeze system was commissioned to prevent cup water seals freezing in cold weather. Cup water levels were checked and found satisfactory. Personnel visited the site on December 13 and checked the antifreeze boiler and pipework. Reported as satisfactory at 16:16 hrs. On December 14, the cup seal of the top lift of No 5 LP Holder blew. Personnel arrived on-site on December 14 to carry out the daily check on the antifreeze steam boiler. They found a large escape of steam at the base of the riser leading up the side of the holder, and called out maintenance assistance. When the steam supply was isolated, a further noise was heard, which was traced to the top cup seal on No 5 gas holder (from holder height telemetry records, it was subsequently shown that a sudden increase in rate of stock loss occurred at about the time that personnel arrived on-site but no connection exists). Gas was being boosted from the LP Holders and the rate of stock change was inside those of previous winter patterns. Further personnel were called to site, including management, and the Off-site Plan was initiated resulting in fire brigade and police attendance. Despite using fire tender's assistance, water could not be re-introduced to the cup seal and the holder descended until the seal was immersed in the holder water tank when all gas leakage stopped. The gas cloud dispersed without igniting.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
Natural gas release due to loss of water in top cup seal. The gas cloud dispersed without igniting.                                                                                                                                 
CAUSES:
When the Original Report was prepared, the causes of the accident were not fully identified. It is believed that a combination of freezing overnight temperature, followed by temperature rise, and the steam leak forming condensate in the flexible hoses leading to the top seal (which in turn produced a syphon as the gas holder was elevated towards full stock) were the causes. No other causes were found (a split in the cup holder bottom has been estimated less likely). Subsequent checks showed no leakage from the cup itself. Safety system (low level alarm) did not intervened.","Material Loss:No material losses occurred except the escaped natural gas.Disruption of community life: Though the Off-site Plan was activated, in the Original Report there is no evidence of significant effects outside the establishment.Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The adjacent gas holder was shut-down and the leaking holder was emptied.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The external emergency services were informed.

467,1157,Major Accident,"Waste storage, treatment and disposal",Explosion during discharge of liquid waste,2018-09-13 14:35:00,2018-09-13 14:50:00,"On 13 September 2018 at around 14.37, an explosion took place, followed by a very brief localised fire at the North discharge pit. The explosion took place during the discharge of liquid waste from a tanker into the North discharge pit. The discharge pit is a concrete underground tank covered with a concrete lid. The remains of a previous discharge were present in the discharge pit. When the waste materials mixed with each other, a reaction occurred leading to the generation of oxygen, which formed an explosive mixture together with the solvents contained in the discharge pit. Further investigation showed that 3 possible scenarios regarding the ignition source can be considered. It is not possible to say with absolute certainty what the actual source of ignition was.","During the transfer from the tanker into the discharge pit, at the time of the accident, an explosive atmosphere formed. The investigation into possible ignition sources shows that there are three possible scenarios.

— Ignition source in the discharge pit
— Ignition source in the vicinity of the discharge pit
— Ignition from the furnace

The various scenarios and their likelihood are briefly explained below.
Ignition source within the discharge pit. 
Gases having a self-ignition temperature of around 200 °C were present in the discharge pit. &nbsp;However, the self-ignition temperature lowers in an oxygen rich environment. &nbsp;Assuming a halving then the self-ignition temperature may have been lowered to 100 °C. &nbsp;However, the temperature switch present in the discharge pit, was not activated before the explosion, which implies that the temperature in the discharge pit remained below its setpoint of 90 °C. &nbsp;
Due to the oxygen formation, foam was generated in the discharge pit, which could have led to an electrostatic discharge. Due to the higher oxygen concentration in the discharge pit, also the ignition energy of the products is lowered. &nbsp;If this is being considered a possible source of ignition, it remains unclear why the explosion occurred 10 minutes after the discharge started, while after 3 minutes the oxygen concentration already represented more than 50% in the discharge pit. &nbsp;Furthermore, the foam is formed by a product with good conductivity.
This scenario is considered unlikely.
Ignition source nearby the discharge pit
Hereby the possibility is investigated that the explosive mixture ignited outside the discharge pit. It should be noted that the zone surrounding the discharge pit is classified as zone 2, which implies that the installations present therein, do not constitute an ignition source during normal operation. &nbsp;From the pressure measurements, it appears that the pressure in the displacement gas network remained below 16 mbar. &nbsp;This pressure is too low to open the pressure relief valve on the discharge pit. The pressure relief valve is set to 18 mbar. &nbsp;At some point, a pressure decrease is observed, but this is too slow to be due to the venting of the pressure relief valve. &nbsp;The pressure profile of the pressure reduction, with a pressure decrease which is slower at the beginning than at the end, also does not indicate the venting of a pressure relief valve. &nbsp;On the other hand, one can think that a pressure increase in the displacement gas network has caused one rusted section of the pipework to fail. &nbsp;After the explosion indeed, at some places in the displacement gas network holes were found in the pipes. Further metallurgical investigation showed that the piping still had a sufficient thickness to resist against the pressure increase before the explosion.&nbsp;
This scenario is considered unlikely.
Ignition from the furnace
The pipeline to the furnace, during the minutes before the explosion, was filled with a mixture that systematically has become richer in oxygen. &nbsp;In addition, at the time of the accident also a discharge was ongoing on discharge pit South. While pumping from the discharge pit into tank V11010, &nbsp;vapours from this tank, containing toluene vapours were pushed in the pipelines of the displacement gas network. &nbsp;As this is the same pipeline, it is certainly possible to have formed a flammable mixture. &nbsp;This mixture could have been ignited in the furnace, so it is possible that the flame ran against the flow back. &nbsp;&nbsp;
However, the flame arrestor, present in this pipe should have ensured that the flame was stopped. &nbsp;According to the company, there are two scenarios that can explain why the flame arrestor may not have worked:

Such flame arrestor may fail when the oxygen concentration is higher than 40%. &nbsp;Higher oxygen concentration will increase the flame speed.
A flame arrestor ensures that the hot combustion gases cool down within the fine mesh of the flame arrestor. &nbsp;If this occurs several times then the flame arrestor can become too warm to function properly

When the flame has passed the flame arrestor it can further propagate towards tanks and discharge pits. &nbsp;Because of the high oxygen concentration, the flame speed can reach more than 100 m/s, and will travel in a short time to the intersection of the pipelines to the tanks and the pipelines to the discharge pits. &nbsp;In the pipelines to the tanks, the flame will extinguish due to lack of oxygen. &nbsp;The concentration of oxygen that has flowed previously from the discharge pit North towards the tanks is rather limited.&nbsp; The flame will propagate further towards the discharge pits. &nbsp;Here is a higher oxygen concentration and probably sufficient combustible gases. &nbsp;Due to the increased oxygen concentration, the flame propagation will be very fast.&nbsp; In the pipeline to the discharge pit South, the flame will extinguish due to a lack of oxygen (analogous reasoning as for the tanks), but in the discharge pit North, on the contrary the flame can cause an explosion.&nbsp; The rise to 3 mbar at the level of PT901 (furnace), about 10 s before the explosion which can be caused by a first ignition in the displacement gas network line, stopped by the flame arrestor. Also consistent with an ignition from the furnace is that pressure gauge PT90009 which is the furthest from the furnace in the lines, doesn’t show the same pressure increase as the other pressure gauges during the explosion.
So ignition from the furnace is considered the most likely ignition source.","The explosion destroyed the discharge pit and caused enormous damage to the transfer station. Moreover, one operator died as a result of the explosion and four other persons were slightly injured. These slight injuries were caused by a pressure wave and by flying debris. The slightly injured persons have fully recovered. One of the persons who was slightly injured is the operator who helped the person who was killed to perform the operations for connecting a pump. He was injured by flying debris. The other victims are drivers who were present in the vicinity of the discharge pits. Two discharge pits (North and South) are present on the site and are located close to each other. Two of these drivers were by their tanker, which was being unloaded at that time. Each tanker is unloaded into a different discharge pit. In addition, another driver was passing by the discharge pits at the time of the explosion. He is thought to have been carrying his papers and passed by just as the explosion occurred. The drivers involved suffered temporary damage to their hearing as well as injuries caused by flying debris.
4 persons who suffered hearing damage and slight injuries from flying debris.","The explosion was followed by a short fire, which was extinguished by the company’s intervention team. The cut-off supply of nitrogen to the transfer station was also sealed off. The slightly injured victims were taken to hospital for examination.The firm’s intervention team carried out the intervention.Injured victims were taken to hospital.","Even if a substance is not classified as oxidising, the presence of peroxides, even at low concentrations, can lead to the formation of oxygen during reactions with other substances.
After the accident, the firm tightened up its acceptance procedures for waste products. This includes more extensive mixing testing of all waste products that are discharged together into a storage tank.
Following the accident it was decided to stop using the discharge pits. Waste products that are still authorised to be stored in tanks after the stricter tests are discharged directly into tanks. If an explosion occurs in a conventionally designed vertical storage tank, normally only the cover becomes detached due to a weak weld between the wall and the cover. The risk of someone being on the cover at that time is much smaller.
A flame arrester is not a suitable means for preventing re-ignition in the event of continuous or repeated ignition. The flame arrester must therefore be equipped with a temperature detector. If the flame arrester heats up, the pipe can be shut off by a valve to prevent the flame reigniting.
The flame arrester must also be periodically inspected, as contamination can also cause flames to pass through a flame arrester."

There had been no movement of product on this tank since 02/07/2007, the date filling ended. Tank level records showed abnormal variations since 05/07/2007. The level of the liquid in the tank was 14 m when the roof sinking was detected and a surface area of 3,850 m² of crude oil was in direct contact with the ambient air.Hydrocarbon concentration sensors located in the area around the town recorded very high concentrations (from 10,000 to 25,000 µg/m3) for an average ambient noise of 1,500 µg/m3.The inspectorate of classified installations recorded the facts. The operator transferred the contents of the tank to the other tanks of the refinery by gravity until the level of the liquid was close to that of the roof, which stabilized at 2.8 m. The tank shell wass then perforated under high pressure and water was injected into the tank so that the hydrocarbons could then be removed by pumping. The operations continued for several weeks to drain off the fluids and sediment at the bottom of the tank.The plan was to repair the tank and bring it back into service by end of August 2009.","Pending the results of ongoing investigations while the tank was emptied and the roof is stabilized and then dismantled, the operator's initial observations leaned towards the scenario of a loss of buoyancy through overload, due to accidental filling of an unsealed buoyancy tank with crude oil and the accumulation of rainwater on the roof.&nbsp; The valve at the bottom of the rainwater draining tank was effectively closed, as hydrocarbon leaks had been detected in the rainwater discharge drain for several months.","No victims among the personnel of the site and no immediate impact reported on the populations surrounding the site. Only the sensors measuring the concentration of hydrocarbons installed in the town of Petit Couronne recorded very high concentrations (from 10,000 to 25,000 &micro;g/m3) for an average ambient noise of 1,500 &micro;g/m3. ","The operator monitored the power feeds of the tank and checked the concentration of hydrocarbon vapour in the draining tank every two hours. A vehicle from the refinery's fire brigade was parked next to the tank ready to intervene.The operator transferred the contents of the tank to the other tanks of the refinery by gravity until the level of the liquid was close to that of the roof, which has stabilized at 2.8 m. The tank shell was then perforated under high pressure and water was injected into the tank so that the hydrocarbons could then be removed by pumping.

469,955,Major Accident,"Waste storage, treatment and disposal",Explosion of tank truck with chemical waste,2016-02-26 15:30:00,2016-02-26 17:30:00,"A runaway reaction in a tank truck which was being processed by means of direct injection into a rotating drum furnace caused pressure to build up in that tank truck. That build-up of pressure caused the bursting disk to burst, the safety valve to open and then the tank truck to split open. As the tank truck split open, the gas cloud which had been released via the safety valve was ignited. The force with which the tank truck split open caused other tank trucks nearby to move and some of them to be torn open, resulting in a pool fire. Account of events before the accident - On 25 February at 15:50 the processing of the product started. A temperature of 55 °C was then measured in the line from the truck to the furnace. The tank was delivered on 25 February at 10:00 and the delivery temperature was 35 °C. The aim was to start processing at 12:00, but this could not be done because the product was too viscous and the tank was warmed up with steam (6 bar - 160 °C). At 15:50 it was decided to try again to start the processing and from that time the temperature in the feedline was logged. The temperature in the tank itself was lower than the temperature measured in the feedline because the measurement was taken in the feedline to the furnace, where the product had been additionally warmed up through tracing. - On 26 February at around 10:00 (the steam (heating) to the tank was still on) it was noted that the N2 flow, press the tank empty, dropped, but the supply to the furnace remained the same. This indicated that a different mechanism (see below) was causing pressure in the tank. - On 26 February 2016 at around 11:00 the steam heating of the tank was stopped after inspecting it and checking the temperature gauge on the tank, which read 45° C at that moment. The log shows that at that moment the temperature in the feedline was 124 °C.
- On 26 February between 11:30 and 12:00 there was a brief standstill in the direct injection owing to the normal operation of the incineration process in the oven itself. During that standstill the gas release outlet from the tank to the furnace was opened automatically because of high pressure in the tank. This was not noticed by the operators.
- On 26 February at 12:00 the direct injection was started again. After that start N2 flow was no longer required in order to feed the furnace (the pressure in the tank itself was apparently sufficient). The feed flow to the furnace fluctuated a lot after the stoppage. This was possibly attributable to gas bubbles in the product being fed into the furnace. Those gas bubbles posed a problem for the flow gauge. Later on, the pressure built up more and more: The gas release outlet to the furnace was more and more open, the tank’s bursting disc and safety valve opened and finally the tank burst at 15:33. The operators present at the tank truck fled when the safety valve opened. Therefore nobody was injured.
","Cause of the build-up of pressure in the tank: - Build-up of pressure resulting from a (runaway) decomposition reaction: At laboratory scale the waste flow showed an exothermic polymerisation reaction at a temperature of 129 °C (in practice 120 °C). At higher temperatures a decomposition reaction takes place. For ACA itself that decomposition temperature is 157 °C, but for the waste flow it is lower. - The tank was heated with steam for 20 hours. During the inspection visit on 3 May 2016 the firm explained that the log showed that this was the first time that the heating on the tank itself stayed on for so long. There is no rule for tank heating time because this was not regarded as critical before the accident. It is a mere coincidence that on previous occasions the heating had never been on for so long. Although there is a concern to prevent blockages in the feedline to the furnace and therefore the heating is left on for long enough. The handling fiche for direct injection states that the tank should be additionally heated to 40 °C. This temperature should be checked during inspection rounds. This would show that the temperature measurement on the tank itself read 45 °C at the moment when the heating was turned off. - Calculations made by the firm show that, in view of the heating method (halfcoil connected to 6 bar steam), the heating period, the reduction of the quantity of product in the tank as a result of the feed and the properties of the product, it is possible that the temperature at which the decomposition reaction starts was in fact reached in the tank. Those calculations also took into account the product’s viscosity, which hampers heat transfer such that in places higher temperatures could be reached. - This information was not known to the firm before the accident and so no attention was paid to this aspect when the firm accepted the product for processing or when changes were made to the processing.
","Truck parking for direct injection completly destroyed.All rotary kilns out of service due to fire damage for about a week, one month and 4 months.","Evacuation of the site went smootly.Fire's were put out by the public fire brigade. Additional fire water supply was necessary.A large part of the site was flooded by fire water, hindering fire fighting.","The properties of the most hazardous product in a waste stream are insufficient to determine the properties of the whole stream. In future the customer will be asked to provide more information on the properties of the actual waste stream. The firm itself will analyse these data more thoroughly.
- For streams which are being heated it is important to know the SADT (Self Accelerating Decomposition Temperature). The firm’s experience shows that this is not always known by the customer. In order to determine the SADT, the firm has bought apparatus in order to be able to carry out these tests. The tests show that at present the firm cannot process the ACA waste stream. The firm explains that a possible solution might be to thin the stream, but this needs to be assessed further."

By having in the sebum, the oxygenated water added decomposed giving oxygen gas. The presence of oxygen generated at 73-74 ° C (which was the temperature of the reactor at the time of the accident) caused the self-ignition of the isopropanol vapors. The reactor cover was open, but if it had been closed in the place of a blast, an explosion could have occurred, if possible with worse consequences.2: It was peroxided at 42%, which did not meet the 30% concentration requirements.3: The manual of the peroxide of violent form, managed to arrive at the electrostatic charges when falling the liquid in the interior.4: There is no work procedure for the transfer","This door was open and 3 operators of the plant itself were in the vicinity of the reactor, one on the left side (did not suffer major damage), another front (fatal damage) and third in the table of electrical controls on the right reactor (he suffered serious burns).

474,940,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Six workers injured due to ammonia intoxication.,2012-07-29 12:20:00,2012-07-29 00:00:00,"Due to leakage of process solution emission of ammonia occured. The detailed course of the accident was as follows:About 7:00 a.m., after regular check of the installation, a worker reported to his superviser emission of the process solution (containing ammonium carbonate). The emission occured in the upper part of the exchanger. The person responsible for maintenace works was called in deal with the damage. In the meantime the affected exchanger was being prepared for the examination and repair. The exchanger was rinsed/washed with water. This task involved opening and closing the proper valves on a pump and injection of water. After the exchanger had been washed, the process solution was added to the installation but with omitting the damaged exchanger. This allowed the maintenance staff to remove the isolation of the exchanger in order to examine it. After the examination of the exchanger was performed, it was decided that leakness would be temporary stopped with a caulker band. In order to do this the internal recue unit was called. They noticed punctual leaks in a few places. Before they started sealing operation it was decided to rinse/wash the exchanger again (doing this twice, in the same way as for the first time). Whille the caulker band was installed inside the exchanger there was water at a low preassure. After installation of the band it was decided to check the tightness using water. It appeared that it was not tight enaugh becasue water was leaking. The worker closed one valve to stop the water flow. At the same time he also opened another valve allowing the process solution to get into the system. The other worker, not being aware that process solution was being injected, thought the tightness tests were going on so he cut (with the valve) the flow of the flow of the process solution. This caused the process solution to go the broken exchanger. Suddenly the upper part of the echanger ruptured causing the emmision of the process solution. Due to its evaporation toxic claud was formed. One warker fell down because of the gust that appeared. The other five workers were intoxicated. All of them were injured and taken to the hospital. The analysis of the caourse of the accident showed that together with the emission of ammonium carbonate also ammonia was released, most probably from the absorption column due to the fact that one volve was partailally opened. ","The accident occured because of the aging of the equipment.Direct causes were as follows:- technical failure of the exchanger due to thining of its sides/walls caused by corrosive impact of ammonium carbonate (the deatiled examination showed that the content of oxygen in th process solution significantly infuenced the corrosion rate/speed). - lack of a coordinator of the maintenance works,- lack of communication beetwen the workers operating the valves,- limitted possibilities for efficient protection (the workers did not use the gas masks eventhough they were available).", Due to the leakage of the process solution and ammonia 6 people were intoxicated. The injured people were hospitalized from 9 to 41 days. ," On site emergency measeres were applied immidiately. The activities taken involved the following:- the operation of the installation was partially stopped and emptied,- activation of the water sprinklers in order to limit the danger area.No negative effects reported beyond the establishment. The temporary stop of the exchanger on one of the sections did not interrupt the installation's operration and did not require stopping of the production. ","In order to prevent such accidents in the future the following activities have been taken:1. The accident was discussed with all the workers of the urea unit2. For the works in which more than one person is involved, obligation for appointing a responsible for switching/changing procedure. 4. Undertaking technical and organizational activities in order to limit the danger from working factilities/devices within the urea unit i.e.: measure of the thickness of the pipelines, monitoring of the pipelines and devices during planned stoppages (annually), analysis of the possibility of the current evaluation of passivation efficiency, updating the technological instructions and elaborating new ones.5.

The outage was linked to the malfunction of 2 pieces of electrical distribution equipment owing to high temperatures (summer season). The polymerisation unit’s reactors and detectors were supported by 1 of 2 back-up generators, the other being out of order.
The reactors’ air network and water/ammonia (NH3, toxic gas) cooling network were no longer powered as the ‘utilities’ unit supplying them had just lost its back-up generator. The extended shutdown of the NH3 compressors caused internal excess pressure of 15.2 bar. A leak occurred in the safety valves set to 15 bar in the compressor room.",The operator launched an investigation to examine what caused the generator backing up the ‘utilities’ unit to break down.,"The release of NH3 through the roof of the building was suspected, access to the site was blocked by the gendarmes.

This resulted in EDA leaking onto a ‘WHG surface’ (a surface compliant with the requirements of the Federal Water Act [Wasserhaushaltsgesetz – WHG]) and forming a localised pool of liquid. Vapour clouds then formed due to the immediate reaction of the hygroscopic EDA vapours with the high levels of humidity in the air. This triggered the automatic fire detection system (smoke detector) and activated a water curtain on the southern wall of the building. The water from the water curtain precipitated the vapours and diluted the leaked EDA (high water solubility).

The bursting discs' had not been included in the sites planned preventative maintenance programme and evidence suggests that they had not been changed in over 11 years. It is believed that the bursting disc probably failed due to fatigue. The manufactures of the bursting disc confirmed that this type of disc is now obsolete.

This was caused by an aerosol can which had fallen earlier and was crushed, with subsequent ignition of the gas.
Moreover, the aerosol cans returned by customers had leaks.
The fork-lift truck was not a priori of an appropriate type for this area.
","One employee and 4 firemen were injured, the firemen while firefighting. Fire-fighting water was contained within the site's retention system, so there was no release to the environment.","The detection and alarm system worked.
About 140 firemen fought the fire for 4 hours.
About 100 people were evacuated, since the factory was in an urban area.

485,1205,Near Miss,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Release of gas from tank with recovered oil from water treatment plant,2019-11-22 23:30:00,2019-11-23 01:00:00,"On 22 November 2019 at 23:28, alarms signalling a high level in a tank for recovered oil were received in the offsite control room.The tank contains recovered oil from the facility's water treatment plant. Shortly after, alarms from gas and hydrogen sulphidedetectors were received from a biofilm plant, located approximately 70 metres from the tank. The gas readings quicklyincreased to 100% of the lower explosion limit and up to 40 ppm hydrogen sulphide. The experience in the control roomwas that the situation developed very quickly, was difficult to understand and that it was out of control. The firstassessment was that the tank was overflowing, but&nbsp; no pumps delivering to the tank were running at thetime. The evacuation alarm was activated. Within three to four minutes the gas alarms cleared, and the tank level wasnormalised. Emergency preparedness personnel were quickly mobilised. Smoke divers did not find any traces of oil spillwhen searching around the tank. The temperature in the tank was examined using a thermal camera, and smoke diversturned off the steam supply using valves at the tank. The thermal camera showed gas/steam rising upwards from thetank. The situation gradually normalised, and the ‘danger over’ signal was sounded at approximately 01:00 the nextmorning.","The direct cause was sudden boiling with phase transition and foaming (slopover) in the tank due to overheating. Parts of an emulsion layer in the tank was dissolved due to&nbsp; high temperature&nbsp;in the underlying water zone. A rapid transfer of heat took place as oil and water from the hot emulsion layer and from&nbsp;the water zone mixed with the oil layers resulting in boiling in the oil phase. This initiated foaming and release of gas. This&nbsp;is a process that can occur in oil tanks containing a water phase and heat supply.
There are many underlying causes:

Lack of barriers. Some barriers (for example automatic temperature control on the tank) had been removed without proper MOC in earlier modifications. Inadequate risk assessment of changes&nbsp; and inadequate hazop and follow up of hazop.
Loss of competency, knowledge and understanding of risks associated to the specific operation.
Personnel acceptance of deviations as being ""normal"" (temperature alarms in control room not trusted, believed to be unreliable)
Introduction of new type of waste to the water treatment tank (containing more lighter hydrocarbons than before) without&nbsp;assessment of the increased risk.
","The incident resulted in a release of approximately 1100 kilos of process gas.
The investigation team classified the incident with the highest actual degree of seriousness Actual Red 1 - Oil / Gasleakage and highest potential degree of seriousness under slightly different circumstances Possible Red 1 - Death.Slightly different circumstances mean that it is only by chance that alternative outcomes of the incident did not occur, andnot what could have happened in a worst-case scenario. It was only by chance that the spill did not increase or ignite.The classification is based on the emission rate, presence of ignition sources and estimated consequences if personnelhad been exposed to ignition of the gas. The incident is classified with the highest degree of severity Red 1.Experience from events referenced by Shell documents the potential of similar events. In the investigation team's opinion,it was pure chance that the incident at Mongstad did not have a more serious outcome in the form of a major accident.There were no technical barriers that could have prevented a further increase in the tank temperature. If the temperaturehad been a few degrees higher, causing boiling in the water phase, the outcome would have been much more serious.Gas detection was very limited in the offsite area. Road traffic, streetlights and unprotected buildings would be potentialsources of ignition for a large gas cloud. The outcome with regard to personal injury in such an event would have beenaffected by the time of day, activity level and the number of people at the facility.","The area was evacuated according to internal procedures. Internal&nbsp; emergency preparedness personnel were quickly mobilised. Fire fighters provided with special equipments to dive into smoke did not find any traces of oil spill&nbsp;when searching around the tank. The temperature in the tank was examined using a thermal camera, and&nbsp;fire fighters turned off the steam supply using valves at the tank.&nbsp; The ‘danger over’ signal was sounded at approximately 01:00 the next&nbsp;morning.","Based on the cause of the incident, recommendations&nbsp; have been given:
- Need for improved Process knowledge,&nbsp;improvements in training of personnel,&nbsp;updating of documentation,- Improvement of technical safety barriers to prevent similar incidents,- The need for gas detection in the area in question,- Zero tolerance regarding acceptance of deviations as being ""normal"",- Risk assessment of operational changes,- Increased quality in HAZOP reviews and closure of findings."

The wind velocity was about 5 mph (2.2 m/sec). It was a sunny day.An iron-chlorine fire developped during stress relieving by heat treatment at 400°C of a tanker padding line. As a result of the iron-chlorine fire, the pipeline was destroyed and a few hundreds kilograms of chlorine were released to the atmosphere.The chlorine detection system warned operators who put on self-contained breathing apparatuses and isolated the storage tank using remotely operated shut-off valves.","CAUSES:The release of chlorine occurred because of the damage of the padding line from chlorine bulk storage tank to road tanker unloading. The line was damaged by an iron-chlorine fire developped during the stress relieving by heat treatment at 400°C. The accident is mainly attributed to the confusion in the issue of permit to work. The issuer thought that another pipeline was to be heat-treated, whereas the counter-signer assumed that isolations instituted earlier for pipeline replacement were still in place. The system of work-permit was, in any case, inadequate (code 5303).","MATERIAL LOSS:A piece (12"" long) of the 2"" pipeline from the bulk chlorine storage tank to the road tanker unloading point was destroyed by the iron-chloride fire.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX DENSITY OF POPULATION:A chlorine concentration of 0.3 ppm in air was detected at 500 metres to the West from the establishment (on a map attached to the Original Report is shown the wind direction when the accident occurred).

This is where the impregnation of power and telephone poles normally takes place. The automatic fire alarm went off to the SOS Alarm Centre who alarmed the emergency response. Approximately 200 (metric) tons creosote oil was stored in the impregnation plant together with equipment for running the impregnation process such as (pressurized) impregnation cylinders,  transport pumps, vacuum pumps, pipes etc. The fire was extensive and the whole creosote impregnation plant burned down. Parts of the building connected to the impregnation was also ruined and other parts were demolished in order to prevent spreading of the fire. The emergency response services called in several emergency response teams and when the most, there were 35 rescuers from 5 different teams. The fire was fought with water and foam additives. All the water from fire fighting  was left in the concrete kasuns/pools that were casted under the impregnation impregnation cylinder. This fire fighting water, totally 841 tons, and 220 tons with unspecified environmentally dangerous building material, was later sent for destruction. An investigation including soil samplings has been made.

489,849,Major Accident,"Power generation, supply and distribution ",Natural gas released during a pigging operation in a pipeline bringing natural gas on-shore,1994-02-09 14:15:00,1994-02-09 14:30:00,"During a pigging operation, a 30"" pipeline, bringing natural gas on-shore, failed between the emergency shut-down (ESD) valve and the pig trap. The intervention of the ESD valve from the control room failed and it had to be closed locally. Released natural gas did not ignite, but was a serious risk to personnel.","CAUSES:
When the Original Report was prepared, the causes of pipeline failure were not fully identified. It may be linked to pigging operation that was underway, with the pigs possibly entering the on-shore section of pipe at high speed and then sticking, causing stresses in the pipe. The ESD valve failed to operate because, before the accident occurred, it had been isolated from the control room for maintenance work but the need to de-isolate had been overlooked.Failure of pipeline at latent defect when subject to stresses well in excess of those experienced during normal operations. Design of plant not adequate to cope with this although such stresses are not foreseeable.","MATERIAL LOSS:No material losses occurred except the natural gas released at 130 psi for 10 minutes. Actual costs not obtained. However, no offsite losses occurred. Main
onsite losses have been a result of loss of production rather than
material lost. Figures of 20 - 30 millions euros lost production have
been talked about.People - Remarks: Since the release was controlled relatively quickly, only those persons in and around the immediate area of the pipeline failure were at risk. If ignition had occurred, it is likely that these numbers could have increased.Ecological harm - Remarks: The natural gas released, predominantly methane, dispersed to the atmosphere and therefore did not threaten any serious ecological harm.Disruption of community life: Since the ignition of the release gas did not occur, the incident did not escalate to have offsite consequences. As a result, there was no offsite disruption and the incident did not become public knowledge.Affected Area: installationThe actual consequences of the incident were not addressed in
the various aforementioned items since more serious consequences had in
fact been taken into consideration. The safety of the tasks being
undertaken at the time of the failure was controlled by written
operating procedures."," INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:On-site emergency procedures were activated and all on-site personnel (approximately 70 people) were evacuated to muster points. The intervention of the ESD valve from the control room failed and it had to be closed locally. It took about 15 minutes to manually close the ESD valve.EXTERNAL SERVICES:Police was alerted about the accident but off-site emergency plan was not activated because it was controlled in about 15 minutes.
Official action taken - legal action: None taken although very serious consideration was given to prosecuting a middle manager, for allegedly, deliberately defeating the permit to work system.Official action taken - other official action: Offshore Safety Division, Pipelines Expert Team, imposed conditions with respect to assessing the fitness for purpose of the pipeline prior to it being brought back into use.","Measures to prevent recurrence: Plant-re-HAZOPed. Improved work instructions have been developed, a reassessment of ""fitness for purpose"" of all onsite pipework has been conducted. Competence testing in use of permit to work system to be introduced.Measures to mitigate consequences: Emergency shut down system to be tied into fire and gas detection systems to allow automatic activation.Useful references: Report no. 620551/1/94, ""Investigation of a failure associated with a sphere T at the Phillips Petroleum Bacton Gas Terminal"", The Welding Institute, Cambridge."

This arcing for 29 seconds pierced the stinger cooling water circuit. The water poured into the furnace and evaporated on contact with the metal, producing hydrogen. The pressure in the furnace rose. The steam and hydrogen were evacuated through the valve from the furnace’s air pumping circuit, but the pressure continued to rise. The portholes of the furnace give way in turn. When the water circuit was shut off by the foundry worker, the pressure decreased and air entered the furnace. The mixture of hydrogen and air became explosive, resulting in the first explosion and the destruction of the furnace casing and crucible cooling circuit. The crucible cooling water poured onto the molten metal on the ground, generating steam and hydrogen. Mixed with air, the hydrogen caused the second, more violent explosion. The secondary arcing could have been the result of a problem of geometry, surface condition and/or quality of the fitting of the parts (stinger, stub and tip). The stinger secondary arcing scenario was not considered in the hazard assessment.","Two explosions. The first explosion occurred at 21:33 and the second, more violent one at 21:36. The damage to property is estimated at EUR 13 million. The furnace was destroyed. The roof and cladding of the workshop were damaged, a load-bearing wall was cracked, the windows of the maintenance building opposite the site of the explosions were broken. The remelting workshop is out of operation for a minimum of 3-4 weeks.","Two explosions. The first explosion occurred at 21:33 and the second, more violent one at 21:36.

491,1127,Near Miss,Chemical installations ,"Explosion, fire and release of substances at a caustic wash in an acetylene plant",2017-08-10 09:00:00,2017-08-10 10:00:00,"Upon opening/lifting the retention cover (installed in the column flange of the hand hole), the staff at the scene noticed a crackling or hissing noise. The work area was evacuated as quickly as possible and the staff left the platform via a stairway. Even before the staff could reach the ground, around 09:01, there was an explosion-like bang at the open manhole followed by a fire ball. A fire then broke out.The subsequent root cause analysis revealed the following sequence of events:- The introduction of impact energy at the start of the work when opening the retention cover of the column filling initiated a reaction of the polymers.- Decomposition reaction of the stored acetylene compounds and terminal triple hydrocarbon bonds.- Reproduction of the decomposition reaction in the polymerisate (‘deflagration in solids') within the column, resulting in the formation of combustible gases (including H2 and other volatile aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons), soot, and reaction heat.- reaction heat (= decomposition energy) resulted in the evaporation of the residual moisture (water) and hydrocarbon compounds included in the polymerisate.Evaporated substances escaped from the column as white vapour and formed a flammable/explosive atmosphere outside the column.- Build-up of pressure in the column from the vapours and gases formed.- Pressure in the column causes the retention cover to come loose with a jolt and fly out.- Spontaneous release of pressure as the vapours streamed out from the column, taking with them the aggregate from the filling.- Ignition of the gas cloud outside the column due to sparks from the flying filler debris.- Fire outside the column fed/maintained by continuing flow of combustible gases formed by the ongoing (decay) reactions inside the column.It is assumed that there was no fire inside the column because:- Flames were coming out from/at all openings of the column so that no oxygen could enter the column;- the jacket of the column is undamaged; in the event of an internal fire, at least the external corrosion coating (zinc epoxy resin) would have had to show signs of melting.- Deposits taken from another manhole are still combustible.Safety measures:Immediately after the explosion and outbreak of fire, the fire brigade was called and further action was taken in accordance with the site emergency plan and the company emergency plans.Water was also sprayed into the head of the column through the existing condensate feed in order to dissipate the energy being released in the column.","The process deposits (so-called polymerisates) have molecule groups with terminal, unstable carbon triple bonds. The polymerisates also contain highly volatile, flammable hydrocarbons. This includes unstable higher acetylene compounds such as vinylacetylene and diacetylene. Safety studies have shown that the deposits (polymers including the unstable acetylene compounds deposited) show sensitivity to decomposition when exposed to impact energy and release large amounts of energy on decomposition.This explains why the application of energy during the lifting of the retention cover was sufficient to initiate a decomposition reaction and subsequently generated sufficient energy to allow the decomposition reaction to continue in the form of a deflagration in solid.","Seven people were indirectly affected by the event and attended the works medical service.Damage to insulation, EMR equipment and grate platforms.Costs: &euro;500,000","During the event:- Launch of the rescue chain in accordance with the emergency plan.- Evacuation of the plant.- Transport of the affected persons to chemical park medical service and subsequent examination.- Closure of ducts (production waste water duct and rainwater duct) to retain fire-fighting water and to prevent contamination of wastewater systems.- air quality monitoring by measuring vehicles outside the chemical park.(No elevated concentrations of pollutants were measured.)After the event:- Cordoning off the surroundings of the area affected by the fire.- Closure of all the grate platforms on the columns, as their stability could no longer be guaranteed.- Sampling of the fire-fighting waters in the plant collection basins and release of the water to the production waste water duct after negative results.- Declaration of the area as a contaminated area due to possible fire residues; including continuous sampling and analysis of components for contaminants.",Increase in alkali concentration in the normal process to reduce the formation of reactive polymerisates.Extension of the cleaning process as follows:-The column remains under nitrogen until the fillers are removed in order to prevent an explosive atmosphere in the column.- Steaming of the column with low-pressure steam to expel hydrocarbons stored in the polymerisate structure so as to reduce the decomposition energy and the proportion of decomposable and/or combustible gases.The steaming also reduces unstable terminal triple bonds in the polymerisates.The effect of steaming has been proven by chemical analysis and safety studies.- Flooding of the column with water for at least two days in order to allow water to be stored in the polymerisates and thus reduce the decomposition energy. The water is not drained until just before the fillers are removed in order to prevent the polymerisates from drying out.- Connection of the column’s recirculation pipe to the water network in order to pour up to 20 t/h of water into the head of the column immediately any decomposition reaction begins. This can reduce or completely prevent the spread of any decomposition reaction that may occur.- Evacuate and cordon off the area around the columns for the duration of the cleaning work.- Inform the fire brigade of the time and duration of the cleaning work in order to minimise response time.
492,827,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Fire of wooden pallets in another area of a storage plant for ammonium nitrate fertilizers,1989-09-01 00:00:00,1989-09-01 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION::Although the storage installation was submitted to article 5 of Directive EEC/501/82 because of ammonium nitrate fertilisers, the fire was confined to a large store of wooden pallets in another area of the site. No dangerous substances were involved and the incident was not a Major Accident as defined in article 1(2)(c) of the Directive. Cable carrying the main 132 kv electricity supply to a large industrial and residential area passed immediately over the site where the fire developped and heat, flames and smoke caused repeated arching between lines carrying separate phases. The power supply became erratic for 30 minutes, was then lost completely for 15 minutes and a restricted supply only was possible during the following 2 days.As part of its article 7(2) inspection duties, the Health and Safety Executive (H.S.E.) decided to carry out an enquiry in each affected installation (submitted to article 5) to establish how they had coped with the loss of power supply. The installations included two major oil refineries. The following potential serious deficiencies were identified:1- Several manufacturers had stated in their Safety Reports that they had alternative source of mains electricity supply to their sites but they had failed to identify that both sources originated from a common supply to the area.2- Major manufacturers such as oil refineries have on-site generation capacity which can also been used to export electricity to the local supply company. They had failed to foresee that on disconnection of the external grid the internal generators would trip on overload as they tried to feed in to the external load. When the generators tripped out pre-scheduled load shedding and shut-down was triggered.3- Some automatic emergency generator start-up devices failed to operate. In one instance, the on-site generator tripped in and out rapidly and frequently as a result of the erratic nature of the public supply and the starting battery was flat by the time the supply was totally lost.4- Several manufacturers had failed to foresee that problems with so called Unintetruptable Power Supply (UPS) could result when the public supply was restored if the supplies were running out of phase.5- Several manufacturers found that they were unable to reach full deluge rates for firewater when their stand-by generators fail due to inadequate capacity of diesel driven fire water pumps.","CAUSES:When the Original Report was prepared, no information were available about the causes of the wooden pallets fire. The inquiry carried out by Health and Safety Executive allowed to identify some problems (such as sources of common cause failure from power supply, unforeseen trip of on-site power generation, inability of emergency power supply systems to cope with an erratic public power supply, phasing out of Uninterruptable Power Supplies, inability to reach full deluge rates for firewater) in process analysis and plant design of the installations in case of loss of public power supply.","COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:Cable carrying the main 132 kv electricity supply to a large industrial and residential area passed immediately over the site where the fire developped and heat, flames and smoke caused repeated arching between lines carrying separate phases.

During this maintenance work a smaller flare was used which was sufficient because a large portion of the installations wasn't operational because of maintenance. During the test of the main flare the operator by accidently closed the main valve of the natural gas supply instead of the valve on the supply branch for the main flare. As a result the plant was tripped because a number of devices (such as compressors) didn't function any more and was then shut down completely. As a result of this a large quantity of process gas was sent to the flare but the smaller flare's pilot flame was extinguished because of the lack of supply of natural gas. So a large cloud of process gas could leave the installation unburned through the smaller flare. The cloud contained among other gases 32 tonnes of ethylene and 4 tonnes of propylene. The whole company had to be evacuated. The accident ended after the cloud was dispersed.,An operator closed the wrong valve at the natural gas supply station.There was no instruction for the test of the main flare he was performing.,Evacuation of the plant and stop of the production during several days.,Evacuation of the plant.,Better training of the operator and better procedures for this type of activity were needed.A back-up for the natural gas supply to the pilot burners of the flare is needed.

substance in the contact with tyres caused a fire.  ","The main causes of the accident was the human factor - allowing the unauthirized person to open the valve resulted in the fact that the deaeration (vent) valve was not opened before the loading process started.

499,1290,Major Accident,Processing of metals using electrolytic or chemical processes,Release of chlorine gas in a surface treatment plant,2021-08-13 17:20:00,2021-08-14 06:45:00,"An evaporator had to be taken out of operation because of the crystalline deposits inside it.A decision was taken to use the time when the evaporator was out of operation to also remove the deposits accumulated in a refilling container (in the basement).Over approximately 10 years, the concentrate from the vacuum evaporator (evaporator used to concentrate electroplating wastewater) has accumulated in this refilling container.
Since water failed to dissolve the hard residue, together with a waste management facility, we initially considered using mining techniques to remove the sediment from the container. The waste management facility took a sample of the sediment and analysed it.The result showed that this method of removal was possible, but difficult because of the spatial constraints, and would be dangerous for the waste management facility staff.As a result, the search for products which could dissolve the sediment began.
Laboratory scale experiments showed that the sediment could be dissolved with sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), this was likewise discussed with the waste management facility.H2SO4 did not come into consideration, as it would generate significant amounts of foam and gas.Dissolving the sediment with HCl would not generate foam or lead to a discernible gas formation. Moreover, this mixture would not generate heat.
The waste management facility was then provided with a sample of the waste product, the sediment with HCl in liquid form. The waste management facility was able to treat/neutralise this liquid without any problems.Then, a plastics engineering company was consulted in order to check whether the container would be able to withstand HCl. This was confirmed.
In order to make this procedure (not part of normal operation) safe, a further experiment was carried out.2 kg of the sediment from the container was mixed with approx. 1.5 litres of HCl (sediment in a container, addition of acid, leave to stand without mixing). This experiment likewise did not generate foam, discernible gas or heat.
The timetable was set as follows:Addition of HCl on 13 August 2021.Pickup of the mixture by the waste management facility on 19 August 2021.
No anomalies were detected after the addition of HCl on 13 August 2021 ([completed] at approx. 07:00).Around noon, a chlorine-like smell was perceptible in the building.The room where the refilling container, and therefore also the container with the mixture, were located, was then checked. An open manhole was found. The manhole was sealed and the exhaust air system of the container (with a built-in scrubber) was turned on.This took place around 14:30, and the maintenance staff had already finished work for the day. Before leaving, they had turned off the exhaust, because they didn't think it still had to be on.The staff working on the ground floor, near the basement exit, had been told to keep an eye out for how things develop. At that time, it had been assumed that the smell was due to the exhaust air system being switched off and the failure to close the manhole.
Following an error message in the fire alarm system, the guards notified the alarm service. The alarm service inspected the room again. By that time, the maintenance foreman was on site, and he discussed the clear deterioration with the plant operator on the phone.
As a result, first the fire brigade and then the competent authority within the LANUV (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, State Office for Nature Conservation, Environmental Protection and Consumer Protection) were notified.The staff were brought to various hospitals in the area as a precaution.Around 01:15, it was decided to evacuate the residents and then continue with the removal of the mixture.After the evacuation, around 05:15, the container emptying process began. It was concluded within minutes.After re-measurement at the exposure site – 3 ppm, the all-clear was given and the emergency personnel began the clean-up.
After removal of the mixture, the fire brigade measured a value of 3 ppm at the source location – 14 August 2021 around 06:00.In the region of the entrance into the source location (central section/ground floor height difference approx. 4 m), a concentration of 1.4 ppm was measured on 14 August 2021. After closing the entrance and waiting approx. 1 hour – 0.2 ppm.Furthermore, a distinct smell was still perceptible at the external door of the source location.
In the view of the operator, this means that a reaction was still ongoing in the source location itself (according to the waste management facility, approx. 1 cm of sediment was left in the container). We believe that the gas formation was caused by a reaction of HCl with components of the deposits.Because of the continuous chlorine emissions, the police initially blocked off the area.After the readings within plant premises fell below the exposure limit values, the plant could be entered again – with the exception of the basement, which remained closed off. The basement was temporarily closed off with foil and tape, to prevent chlorine gas from spreading into the other parts of the plant.The remaining sediments were removed by a specialised company.This scenario cannot happen again because the installation which had caused the sediments has now been permanently shut down.
Safety measures:Evacuation of staff from the plant, notification of the fire brigade and the LANUV.","Probable reaction of sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid.
Cause could not be established at the end of the investigation.","Customer parts, machine equipment.

The accident occurred during the distillation of crude ortho-nitrobenzaldehyde. Six months prior to the final processing the material was oxidized with nitric acid and the products set aside. This led to the formation of appreciable amounts of thermally unstable ortho-nitrobenzylnitrate being formed. This was not recognized and resulted in an earlier exotherm and more vigorous acceleration than had been anticipated. However, immediately prior to distillation, a sample of the crude product was tested using a differential scanning calorimetry method to determine the temperature at which an exothermic reaction would begin. The crude had been washed with water, toluene and caustic prior to testing but the test equipment differed from that specified, and the condensation of water within the equipment masked the identification of an exothermic reaction in the sample. With the information from the test indicating that there was no exotherm likely at and around the operating temperature, the process of distillation of the bulk material was started. At about 140",INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:An exothermic reaction accelerated to deflagration shattering the distillation vessel and causing widespread damage to the premises and some damage to the surroundings.CAUSESThe explosion of the vessel was caused by an exothermic runaway reaction accelerated to a deflagration. The runaway reaction occurred due to the formation of appreciable amounts of the thermally unstable o-nitrobenzylnitrate during the storage (6 months long) of the crude material (o-nitrobenzaldehyde). The formation of o-nitrobenzylnitrate was unexpcted due to an inadequate process analisys and the risk of a runaway reaction was not recognized because the laboratory analysis on a sample of the crude product were carried out in a wrong way.,EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 2 out of 4 people exposed to the explosion were hospitalized.MATERIAL LOSS:Complete destruction of the factory. The windows and the roofs of the neighbouring premises were damaged up to about 400 metres from the plant.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA:The extent of the effects of the explosion is shown on a map attached to the Original Report. In that map the estimated over-pressures and the related effects to people and to structures are shown.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Immediate evacuation of the premises and making safe of other hazardous materials.EXTERNAL SERVICES:Immediate attendance by emergency services but no assistance external to the establishment was required.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established: 1- no further processing of this substance;2- a review of the management system and control of processes.Useful references: The effects of the deflagration of the distillation vessel was equivalent to those of an explosion of about 200 lbs of TNT."

On
wednsday Dec. 3 2008 an explosion occured in
Yaras Fertilizer Production plant in Porsgrunn Norway. 

Three days before, the production in the fertilizer plant had been stopped, due
to maintenance work in the ammonia storage area which caused no supply of
ammonia to the plant. &nbsp;Feedstock to the NP - buffer tank was stopped, and
to avoid chrystallization the buffer tank was continuosly heated with steam
(according to normal procedures). In the stop period a lot of alarms kept
coming, most of them not safety related. Late evening monday december 1. a high
alarm for temperature went off, but was signed out without any further checking
out. Tuesday, december 2. the temperature was still on the high side, but since
the PH-measurements were high, and the steamvalves were shut, it was concluded
that the temperature measurement was wrong. Wednesday dec. 3, 10 minutes before
the explosion, an automatic&nbsp;fire detector&nbsp;directly connected to the
controlroom of the local emergency preparedness unit and to the plant
controlroom, went off. Gas was also observed by the operators in the factory,
the building was evacuated and the operators gathered&nbsp;at the designated
meeting point. Shortly after the evacuation, the
explosion&nbsp;occurs.&nbsp;The pressure from the explosion causes window
damage in the meeting-place area, and five&nbsp;operators are injured due to
glass fragments. The explosion caused a fire in the third floor of
the&nbsp;building, and the fire was&nbsp; extinguished by 14.03.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;","

Decomposition
of ammonium nitrate in NP buffer tank due to high temperature and low pH in the
tank. This caused huge gas formation and rupture of the tank due to
overpressure. The overheating was a result of a leaking steam valve on the 20
bar steam supply to the tank.&nbsp; The indirect causes were that no hazards
for the NP buffer tank were defined in the Hazop study or the risk analysis and
that the tank was not equipped with any automatic safety functions, only
alarms. It is also concluded that there&nbsp;was insufficient follow up of the
plant at shut down conditions.

&nbsp;"," 5
operators with minor injuries caused by fragments of glass
5,5 mill Euro damage to plant
Production loss estimated to 150 000 tons of NPK and 60 000 tons of calcium
nitrated fertillizer

&nbsp;","

&nbsp;A
soon as the automatic fire alarm in the third floor was activated, the fire
brigade and ambulance from Herøya Industrial Park was sent out to the factory.
At the same time, a heavy smoke was detected visually by an operator, and the
local plant alarm was initiated and evacuation of the building started. 10
minutes after the evacuation, an explosion occured, and five people at the
assembley area&nbsp;got minor injuries from glass fragments. &nbsp;Porsgrunn
Fire Brigade was callled in shortly thereafter, and worked together with the
industrial park fire brigade to extinguish the fire. The ambulance transported
2 persons to the industrial park medical unit, and they were transported to the
local hospital for further treatment. 3 other persons with minor injuries were
treated at the&nbsp;industrial park medical unit.&nbsp;

&nbsp;","

This
plant has been running for more than 40 years, and such a risk of explosion
during a stop of the plant was never encountered nor identified. No hazard was
defined in the hazop, neither in the risk analysis nor in the TOPS ( Yara
Technical and Operational Standard), for the neutralization section. 

This incident may be a lesson of learning for all fertilizer production plants.

Over time, this becomes enriched with phosphoryl chloride and is replaced at regular intervals. The only explanation for the intense gas build-up observed is hydrolysis of the phosphoryl chloride with water or alcohols.
An inspection of the substances handled at the facility found that, irrespective of the product/formula, there was no sign of any other critical interactions/reactions. This also applied to the case of cross-contamination between formulae. An inspection for potential water contamination in the ring water found the following possibilities:

Leakage into the heat exchanger, which is operated using cooling water;
Reverse flow of moisture from the waste gas collection system;
Insufficient emptying of residues from the IBCs.

Re 1: Apart from the cooling liquid in the heat exchanger, no water or alcohol is handled at the facility. An inspection of the heat exchanger found increased roughness on the upper surface, but no leaks were detected during pressure testing.
It must also be assumed that, in the event of a small leak in the heat exchanger, the small current of escaping water would react in the liquid-ring pump. The resulting HCl gases would be removed via the exhaust system, and would therefore not lead to an increase in pressure.
Re 2: The waste gas collection system is decoupled from the facility by a non-return valve. An inspection of the valve found no defects. Also, the limited amount of moisture expected in this event is considered to be insufficient to produce the amount of gas observed. It must also be assumed that in such an event, the moisture would react in the liquid-ring pump. The resulting HCl gases would be removed via the exhaust system, and would therefore not lead to an increase in pressure.
Re 3: Once the IBCs have been emptied of residues, they are visually inspected for any remaining liquid before being made available. Despite this visual inspection, however, liquid residue may still be present. Even small amounts of water (e.g. 10&nbsp;l) cause a considerable build-up and release of HCl gas (e.g. 10&nbsp;m3), which can compromise the integrity of the IBCs.
Before the incident, the ring water had most recently been purged and collected in three IBCs on 5&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015. As the hydrolysis delivery pump was malfunctioning on 5&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015, the phosphoryl chloride in the ring water could not be promptly hydrolysed or destroyed, and the IBCs had to be stored temporarily. On that day, one of the three IBCs was emitting HCl, for which the on-site fire service was called and the HCl that had escaped was immediately successfully suppressed with water curtains. For this reason, the IBCs were stored in the chlorine tank wagon shed. From there, on 17&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015 the IBCs were returned to the chlorination building to be prepared for destruction. By 17&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015, no critical situation had occurred in the other two IBCs, which is perhaps due to the fact that, up to that point, the IBCs had experienced only the slow formation of a two-phase system, resulting in a slow reaction only at the phase threshold, or that only a small quantity of water was present in these IBCs. As the IBCs were closed during transportation to the chlorine tank wagon shed, and were otherwise stored there with only a lid placed on top, the HCl gases that were most likely already being released were able to escape via the lid due to the slow speed of the reaction. Therefore, no critical build-up of pressure was observed.
Only when the IBCs were closed or insufficiently opened when transported back for hydrolysis in the chlorination building was it possible that the HCl gases being created could no longer escape, which must have led to the build-up in pressure in the IBCs in the chlorination building. Furthermore, transportation may have led to an increase in the phase threshold, resulting in an increased rate of gas release. This caused the loss of integrity of the IBCs associated with the release of HCl gas, as observed on 18&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015. Up until the day of the incident, the aforementioned mixture was handled openly and sent for correct disposal. The procedure has since been changed.","Outside the operating area, one person was injured and to be treated on an outpatient basis.","Population alerted by sirens and loudspeaker announcements, escaped gases suppressed using water curtains.","Change in procedure:According to the new procedure, the mixture of 3-chloro-o-xylene and phosphoryl chloride arising from the process is no longer handled openly and sent for correct disposal, but instead is distilled within the enclosed facility. The recovered phosphoryl chloride is then fed back into the process, and the 3-chloro-o-xylene is sent for correct disposal."

In accordance with the programme, solid rocket propellant was first to be incinerated, followed by emulsion explosives, and finally the batteries which were incinerated alternately with airbags. Video footage of the feeder unit and hopper chute revealed that during the feeding period, from 00:55 until the incident at 00:59, the maximum feed volumes established under the programme were not exceeded erroneously. Data curves do not suggest the occurrence of any relevant procedural or technical faults. According to the power input to the rotary cylinder, the rotary kiln was operating normally. The incident was triggered at the point at which explosive substances (approximately 2 kg) began to accumulate in the discharge hopper of the annular chamber.
Retrospectively, it is impossible to say which substances and materials were present in the discharge hopper at the time of the incident, and in what volume and composition.
A possible cause may have been emulsion explosives, airbag parts and lithium batteries. The discharge hopper, which was reinforced with refractory material, was destroyed by the explosion. The steel casing (approximately 10 mm welded steel) was ruptured at the weld seams and pressed or propelled against a nearby girder (steel, concrete), which was partly damaged in the process. Parts of it shot through a metal grating on the second level and struck the guide rail carriage.
The inspection flap on the discharge hopper was propelled 7 m across the hall. Electrical cables, control circuits and utility pipelines were damaged and partly destroyed by fragments of projected material. The blast wave damaged much of a non-load bearing partition wall (lightweight construction, insulated trapezoidal sheet metal). Parts of the discharge sluice system and refractory material torn from the ruptured kiln hood landed on the level below the kiln hood. The chute feed tube was apparently pressed upwards by the blast wave and torn from the flange joint.","It is no longer possible to establish the cause of the explosion.
A possible cause was the fast tamped combustion of explosive substances. However, it may also have been an exploding lithium battery which was projected, e.g. by an exploding airbag.
The last item to enter before the explosion was an airbag.",s. Accident Description,"- Fire alarm activated by smoke detector due to steam and dust.
- Automatic alert sent to fire brigade.
- Coordination centre telephone information: ‘no fire’
- Alert called off (fire brigade not yet dispatched). It was not necessary to deploy protective measures and/or rescue services.","The reconstruction of the kiln hood also included structural changes ensuring that no unincinerated explosive material can accumulate in the technically unavoidable annular gap between the rotary cylinder and the hood. This eliminates the cause established in an expert report, i.e. the accumulation of explosive material in the discharge hopper at the kiln hood. Consequently it is not possible for such damage to the plant to occur again.
The new design provides for a plug inserted approx. 250 mm into the front rotary cylinder. The gap between the rotary cylinder and the plug is only approx. 20 mm wide.
The high temperatures in the combustion zone in the rotary cylinder ahead of the plug and the small gap will almost certainly prevent unincinerated material from passing through the gap and entering the discharge hopper area at the kiln hood. In addition, the gap at the hood discharge hopper is reduced from 250 mm to approx. 50 mm.
Additional organisational measures will ensure that no material can accumulate in the hood discharge hopper. Control and cleaning cycles will be laid down to match the material being handled. The volume of material discharged will be monitored and the discharged substances checked for unconverted waste and explosive material.
To monitor the condition of the rotary cylinder as regards wear and deposits during plant operation, the new kiln hood design provides for suitable means of inspection. This ensures that the condition of the rotary cylinder is checked regularly.
The risk assessment for the necessary checks and the procedure for emptying the discharge hopper have been adjusted accordingly. The damage was mainly confined to the secured, physically separate kiln area. In future this will continue to be secured by means of technical and organisational safety measures such as a ban on entering the kiln room when discharging waste, defined safety times on completion of waste discharge and securing the kiln room with light barriers to switch off kiln feeding."
511,597,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of  aqueous ammonia solution flowed in river due to overflow from an amination plant out of operation,1988-08-23 04:00:00,1988-08-23 00:00:00,"On August 23, 1988 during a period in which the plant was out of operation as requested by the authority the 23/07/88, a certain quantity of an aqueous ammonia solution flowed in the water drain network of the establishment and through it to the Bormida's river. The overflow occurred in the storage tank SR-41 collecting a 3% aqueous ammonia solution from the amination plant. At 04:30 a.m. the high level alarm of tank SR-41 sounded. The operators intervened and identified the cause of the malfunction, eliminating it at about 06:30 a.m. The overflow of ammonia was caused by the opening (it is not yet fully clear how it could had been happened) of the pneumatic valve FV-1 that was feeding with water the scrubber tower which treats releases from the safety valves of the amination autoclaves. During the event neither gaseous release nor damage to people and properties occurred. Ammonia levels of 25 mg/l (maximum allowable value was 15 mg/l) were measured by U.S.L. No 7 in the effluent of the plant. Probably, these levels should had been higher because in the Bormida's river (where the effluent of the plant was diluted in a 1:1 ratio) have been measured concentrations of ammonia up to 70 mg/l. The effects on the aquatic life and on the use of contaminated water have not been evaluated because a continuous monitoring has not been carried out.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The accidental opening of the pneumatic valve (air-open type) with emission of water in the scrubber tower which collected the releases of the safety valves of the amination autoclaves, led to the release of an ammonia solution from tank SR-41.

CAUSES:
The water feeding to the scrubber tower was controlled by the pneumatic valve FV-1 that received the opening signal by the flow and pressure sensors positioned on the draining pipes to the tower. As the water gathered on the bottom of the scrubber tower reached a pre-fixed level, the electrical pump PC-2 started sending water into the tank SR-41 via the intermediate tank SA-11b. When the accident occurred, the valve FV-1 was positioned on ""AUTO"" and the autoclaves were opened and empty. A flow meter set-point was wrongly positioned to the maximum sensitivity and it could have caused, for a not clear reason, the opening of the valve with emission of water in the scrubber tower.  Due to an inadequate process analysis and plant design, the overflow piping from tank SR-41 was connected to drain network of the establishment and the ammonia solution, through it, was released into the Bormida's river. About 30 m3 of ammonia solution overflowed during two hours. It was not possible to evaluate the concentration of ammonia released into the river because it was unknown the quantity of 3% solution diluted with water initially contained in the tank.","ECOLOGICAL HARM:Ammonia levels of 25 mg/l (maximum allowable value was 15 mg/l) were measured by U.S.L. No 7 in the effluent of the plant. Probably, these levels should had been higher because in the Bormida's river (where the effluent of the plant was diluted in a 1:1 ratio) have been measured concentrations of ammonia up to 70 mg/l.The effects on the aquatic life and on the use of contaminated water have not been evaluated because a continuous monitoring has not been carried out.OTHER:No material losses occurred except the released ammonia solution.People - Remarks: No people were injured because the leakage of the ammonia solution did not occur in a gaseous release.Disruption of community life: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant effects outside the establishment, except the release of the ammonia solution into the Bormida river.

No 7 in the effluent of the plant.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- to convey into a biological well the overflow piping from the tank SR-41;
2- to convey into a biological well the delivery side of the pump PC2B in case of intervention of the flow and pressure sensors installed on the discharge piping of the safety valves.

This situation only occurs during shortage of EO , e.g. during turnaround phases. Normally railcars are not discharged, but loaded, however the most of the EO is used internally. Prior to the unloading, a cooling unit in the storage area was taken out of production for cleaning and was re-commissioned. This operation included isolating this unit by means of ‘blinds’. After applying startup procedures the operator started the discharge operation. Such operations for safety reasons are exclusively carried out during night shifts. Initially a small batch for quality assessment was discharged into a dedicated tank without any problem. Shortly before the incident, the transport line was rechecked by the operator, valve settings were adjusted to facilitate transfer to the main spherical storage tank. Upon commencing transfer, the operator encountered problems generating a sufficient flow from the pump. Several re- checks of ( valve, pressure etc.) settings and lineups, and confirmations were carried out. After restart attempts, and increasing (nitrogen) vapour pressure in the railcar, an apparently normal pressure gradient and fluid flow was monitored. Sometime later, EO gas alarm was triggered, that shortly thereafter ceased an next was interpreted as a ‘false peak alarm’. Shortly after shift switch, the EO transfer operation was halted as a normal safety precaution. The day shift crew in the daylight discovered signs of EO leakage underneath a manifold, and discovered a blind flange that had not been discovered during the night. This obviously alerted senior management, and soon it was concluded that the entire transferred volume ( 32,5 tons) had found its way into cooling water discharge point via a Pressure Relief Valve. Immediately, the local emergency team was established and started the impact assessment. Simultaneously, local authorities as well as the AKZO Nobel Corporate Emergency response team were alerted, and a independent investigation of the incident by corporate and independent experts with support of the Board of Management was initiated. Important to mention is:","The following conclusions are drawn up on account of the investigation: Operating error plus incomplete application of Management of ChangeCombination of an operating error (leaving a blind flange in place) plus an incomplete application of a Management of Change procedure (maximum allowable operating pressure not in line with the pressure relief valve settings) led to over pressurization of the EO transport system. As a consequence EO material found its way through the relief valve into the cooling water system and finally to sea water. Cleaning the EO Cooler was executed not following a work permit nor was it planned and controlled in the strict turnaround regime.Isolating the cooler in the EO transport system by own personnel for cleaning, remained outside the turnaround (plant maintenance stop) work scope and did not trigger inclusion of these activities into the strict turnaround control routine, nor was it included in a work permit routine. Work permits are issued only for contractors working on the installations. This was one of the causes that contributed to the error in the blind flange procedure. Informal shift handover at operator level and deviation from standard operating procedures.Coordination and handover of activities to be carried out by different operators is informal and the assessment and response to operational deviations is largely delegated to operators, with no stringent requirements to involve line management. This was one of the main causes that contributed to applying higher than normal pressures on the system and not discovering the fact that an additional blind that was put in the system.","The potential consequence of the main event is in this case EO toxification (poisoning) of surface water. Ethylene Oxide is toxic to microorganisms and fish. The LC50 value for fish is 84 mg/l (exposure time 96 hrs.) However, in free flowing water the EO concentration decreases continually due to a combination of evaporation, hydrolysis and biodegradation, as is underpinned by a diagram showing the EO concentration pattern in the affected Askeröfjorden.","Shortly after shift switch, the EO transfer operation was halted as a normal safety precaution. The day shift crew in the daylight discovered signs of EO leakage underneath a manifold, and discovered a blind flange that had not been discovered during the night.

The investigation team would like to stress that these observations are of great value, because they could influence a wide area of the organisation. During the investigation the following observations have been made.  During the investigation the team observed room for improvement in the field of housekeeping,  Examples being:  Absence of signage, welcoming documents and related instructions in the reception area in other than Swedish (i.e. in English)  A reasonable level of tidiness in the reception building with unfixed repairs waiting  In the plant:  Missing valve tags, obstacles on the plant floor that could/should have been removed previously, tools/instruments, hoses and other obstacles in installation landings  From a series of incidents including the subject one in Stenungsund it appears that alarm architecture and –management is an ongoing dilemma.  It would be worthwhile considering a review of Control Room Alarm Architecture comparing critical process conditions -as derived from risk analysis with the way the same conditions are presented in a(ny) control room in a distinctly differing format from status (change) information. Without such distinction, alarms threaten to become ‘information noise’ between (hundreds of) status notifications."

A resulting increase in pressure in a hydrogen fluoride (HF) drum to over 10 mbar led to the release of HF in the production hall. This was condensed using a deluge system (inside the production building).
Taking into account the effectiveness of the exhaust gas scrubber and the exhaust gas fans – which could be kept powered and in operation throughout the incident apart from the short interruption between the central power failure and the manual switchover to the emergency diesel generator – as well as the monitors (outside the buildings), the additional water curtain installed by the plant fire service and the readings of the emission measurement device before the stack, the total amount of HF emitted to the atmosphere can be estimated at 2.6 kg.
The emission measurement device can display four digits, up to 9,999 mg/m³, with deviations of less than 10%. Between approximately 5:00 and 5:30, staff read values between 700 and 800 mg/m³. Taking into account the fall in HF release of approximately 18% within the first hour following the production stop, it is possible to calculate maximum HF concentrations of approximately 1,040 mg/m3 at the start of the power failure. Based on this, a conservative estimate of the amount emitted from the start of the power outage until the end of the water deployment inside and outside the building would be 4.1 kg HF (1,040 mg/m3 x 1,500 m3/h x 2.6 h).
The transfer of the power supply for safety-critical power units and equipment to the back-up power supply (diesel generator) was delayed due to a parallel failure of the UPS (230 V). The UPS would have been necessary for the automatic transfer of consumers to the emergency power supply. Instead, this had to be done manually. In addition, the manual switch for the emergency coolant supply failed. The continuous HF vapours (up to 2,700 kg in total over approximately 4 hours following the cut-off of the raw materials) had to be absorbed in the operational exhaust gas scrubber in the end, as the emergency scrubber installed for such an event did not work due to the non-opening butterfly valve in the inlet pipe.
The spread of these HF vapours was prevented by condensing using stationary process water monitors and water curtains provided by the plant fire service. The water used to condense the HF vapours was all sent to the internal waste water treatment plant and treated in accordance with the approved discharge parameters.",Power failure caused by a hardware error in a remote control system (see trigger).,"Survey of damage / inspection, water damage, corrosion, cleaning; The material damage caused by the release of the HF and the use of the deluge system inside the production hall was recorded separately and, according to current estimates (not all invoices are available yet), is approximately EUR 100,000.","Condensing of vapours inside the building, supported by monitors and fire service water curtains from outside.

518,582,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion of a reactor  used to oxidize a pyridine compound with release of the whole contents,1985-10-23 00:00:00,1985-10-23 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
The accident involved a reactor used to oxidize a pyridine compound with hydrogen peroxide using a maleic anhydride catalyst to form a pyridine-N-oxide. The reaction was recognised to be exothermic; therefore, hydrogen peroxide was added at controlled rates. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide plug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For 
further peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was emitted into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area when the accident occurred, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident.
The oxidation reactor was located in a process room dedicated to the synthesis of 2-chloropyridine with 70% hydrogen peroxide using a maleic anhydride catalyst to form a pyridine-N-oxide.&nbsp; The reaction was recognized to be exothermic. It was controlled by the rate of addition of the peroxide to a well stirred mixture of the catalyst in pyridine compound. The required peroxide for each batch was transferred from bulk storage to an intermediate holding tank. This tank was located on the ground floor process area and the peroxide was pumped into the reactor via a flow meter. The pyridine was pumped into the reactor from 200 litres drums. The catalyst was added from 50 kg bags through the man-hole. The safety features for this exothermic reaction included: circulation of the reactor contents through two heat exchangers during oxidation; a 200 cm pressure relief line to atmosphere with a 0.7 bar bursting disc; a water quench tank located 3 metres above the reactor, which would automatically dump its contents into the reactor should a sudden temperature increase (&gt; 3°C) occur. The peroxide addition pump would not operate if: the quench tank was not full; the circulation pump was not operating; the reactor's vent was not open to the atmopshere. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide slug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For further peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly and resulted in a runaway reaction. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was released into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident. The investigations carried out by the company after the accident showed that approximately 115 Kg of peroxide were added to the reactor over a 3 minutes period instead of the normal 4.5 kg/minute. The subsequent company investigations found valves 4 and 5 closed on the peroxide transfer line and valves 1, 2 and 3 opened just after the accident. For the above accelerated rate of peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 must have been opened. It is thought that an operator failed to close the valves 4 and 5 and opened valves 1, 2 and 3 following the operating instructions. Just after the explosion, he must have realised his mistake and reset the valves in accordance with the correct instructions before the accident investigations.","CAUSES:
The investigations carried out by the company after the accident showed that approximately 115 kg of peroxide were added to the reactor over a 3 minutes period instead of the normal 4.5 kg/minute. The subsequent company investigations found valves 4 and 5 closed on the peroxide transfer line and valves 1, 2 and 3 opened just after the accident. For the above accelerated rate of peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 must have been opened. It is thought that an operator failed to close valves 4 and 5 and opened valves 1, 2 and 3 following the operating instructions. Just after the accident, he must have realised his mistake and reset the valves in accordance with the correct instructions before the accident investigations. The accelerated rate of peroxide addition resulted in an exothermic runway reaction. Besides, the process analysis and the design plant were not adequate.
The explosion was caused by a runaway reaction (code 5106) that occurred because of an addition rate of hydrogen peroxide higher than that expected. It was caused by an operator error (code 5401) in following the operating procedures. Besides, the process analysis and the design plant were not adequate (codes 5307 and 5308).","OTHER:The effects of the explosion were negligible (no plants were damaged by the accident).People - Remarks: As no operators were working in the process area when the accident occurred, no one was injured by the explosion but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects.Affected Area: installation","Emergency measures - Remarks: Although the quench system was immediately activated (code 7102) when the reactor's temperature suddenly increase, the runaway reaction resulted in an explosion. No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the Industrial Inspectorate required the company to:
1- close the reactor man-hole during oxidation;
2- remove the by-pass on the peroxide transfer line;
3- provide an emergency dump tank on the reactor 200 cm vent line."

The total amount was 20 mton and was caused by a wrong connection of a hose. One of our distillation-columns was in start-up mode. The bottom stream was recirculated over the tank farm back to the feed. The morning of August 22nd, the panel operator instructed one of the operators to change the hose connection to a different line in order to run off to a tank. The operator isolated the circulation, blew the hose empty and disconnected it. He then moved the hose under the manifold and picked it up on the other side to connect it to a different line. From what we now know, he must have picked up another hose and connected the wrong hose to the line and left the hose from the bottom stream of the column on the floor with an open end. He gave the all clear signal to the panel operator to start running off to the tank. He walked the line from that point to the tank and found no leaks. The heptane was in the meantime running off towards the sewer system, which was only detected several hours later. The initial volume increase in the receiving tank is not measured as this has a dead volume of 20m3. When the LOPC was detected, the night shift informed all people on call and a cleaning company was called in to start cleaning the sewer system. The morning of August 23rd we had heavy rain-fall and decided to close the site for all transport and any other work as at several places we saw heptane appearing on the surface. We kept production running. ","The company uses a lot of flexible hoses which often leads disorderly situations.
In such a disorderly situation an operator made an error and connected a wrong hose, leaving an open end on the ""right"" hose."," The product was contained in the sewer and waste water system, no emission outside the company.
Risk for major fire if leak had ignited.Affected Area: Affected Area: installationAffected Area: Affected Area: establishment","Spill was collected in the sewer and wastewater system and removed from there by a treatment company.

Since there was a heavy rainfall before all product was removed, the heptane floated out of the sewers when these filled with rainwater. This created a dangerous situation throughout the plant. All personnel was forbidden to enter the installation until the spill was removed.","Good management of flexible hoses and open ends is needed.

At 11:33 PM additional filling of holder commence when inlet valve opened by grid control. Only small increase in quantity of gas stored occurred. Between 11:30 PM and 3:15 AM the next day, when the volumetric governor for the site was shut off, despite the fact inlet valve open and holder should have been filling. Grid control did not notice this although instrumentation showed this to be the case. At 2:00 AM, 5.2.96, members of public reported gas escape. Emergency response team arriving at site found only 5-7 cm of water in cup and grid seal instead of the standard 45 cm's.",At present it appears release of gas was due to the failure of the cup and grip seal seems to have come about due to an insufficient depth of water on the cup. The reasons why this may have occurred are being investigated. Suspected shortcomings with remote filling and emptying procedures for holders may have played a role.,"None, the gas dispersed harmlessly.People - Remarks: There were no injuries or effects on people of any sort. The site is unmanned and relatively remote from surrounding residential areas.Ecological harm - Remarks: No ecological harm of the above types occurred because the gas was non-toxic and lighter than air and escaped upwards being ignited.","The site is normally unoccupied local residents smelt gas before the gas operator were sent to the site. They lowered holder into tank until the seal was remade. Holder then re-inflated to test seal which was found to be good.Emergency measures - Remarks: When grid control became aware of gas release, emergency response team sent to site and volumetric governors for site shut-off plan initiated.Discussion about response: Routine weekly dip-checks on the water seal had never indicated any problem with it. Examinations and tests carried out during attempts to reproduce conditions that could have given rise to the seal failure failed to identify any faults with the cup and grip seal and the small quantity of water found in the seal cup after the incident suggests that the incident may have occurred due to either a leakage of water from the seal cup or a failure to adequately replenish water in the cup at the time the cup and grip mechanism was dipped in the ground water tank. The fact that no obvious leakage could be detected from the cup after the i","Reasons for incident not fully identified at present. The need for
careful control of remote filling operations was identified as being
necessary to prevent the phenomenon of ""false-cupping"" occurring which
could easily lead to a similar release of gas.Measures to prevent recurrence: Though not full explanation of the seal failure has been discovered in the investigation, the introduction of procedures to ensure cup and grip seals are adequately replenished with water before holder filling takes place would help reduce the likelihood of such an event occurring again."

For about 3 hours before and whilst raking was taking place heat was applied through an internal steam battery that was submerged below the tarry residue. The steam supply was at about 135 psig corresponding to a steam temperature of approximately 180°C.When the jet flame erupted it impinged on a nearby control building of wooden construction and a large brick built office behind. The jet consumed the control building in its path killing 2 employees instantly. Two others in the control building later died from burns. The jet caused a fire in the office block which produced smoke and fume. A young female employee was found in the building approximately 30 minutes after the initiating event. She had been overcome by fume and had suffered a hearth attack from which she did not recover. 3 other employees sustained reportable injuries. One was detained in hospital with 15% burns and a number of other employees suffered psychological effects resulting from trauma and shock. Fire damage was confined to the site and water used to extinguish fires at the still base, control cabin and office block were contained and did not contaminate the river and canal which run through and around the factory site. There were no injuries to persons or damage to property off-site. The HSE investigation concluded that the incident resulted from self heating and runaway exothermic decomposition of thermally unstable residues in contact with heated steam pipes. This led to a jet flame with a surface emissive power of about 1000kw/m2 which lasted approximately 25 seconds.","Management failure to provide a safe system of work for removal of potentially unstable highly energetic residue from a vessel which had not been opened and cleaned for many years. These failings were characterised by a number of errors including:-i) Failure to test the residue and atmosphere inside the vessel;ii) Application of heat to the residue;iii) Use of a metal rake;iv) Failure to blank off an inlet before the work commenced, etc.",Approximately 200 persons were exposed- 5 persons killed by fire;- 1 was hospitalized;- Material damage: total loss of the control building. Extensive fire damage to the&nbsp;&nbsp; internal fabric of the main office building. Amount: 1.25 millions Pounds.,"Internal fire crew responded to extinguish fires at the still base and the control cabin after the jet had subsided. The on-site fire alarm was sounded, the emergency services were called and employees followed the company's fire evacuation and assembly procedure.Roads around the factory were sealed by the police and 22 units from the Fire Service attended. They concentrated on the office block fire and carried out a search and rescue for missing persons. After the female casualty was found she was transferred to hospital by a police helicopter. The fire service took water from the nearby river to fight blazes on site. Within days of the incident a significant number of fire service personnel reported sick with a variety of symptoms including eye and skin irritation, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.The public Health Department investigation that followed looked at 2 possible causes, ie toxic and gastro intestinal effects. No evidence was found to implicate toxic chemicals arising from the fire but a viral source was identified for the outbreak of gastro intestinal problems. This may have been associated with food and drink consumed at the site.",Immediate shutdown of the Meissner Plant. The new operations director strengthened area production management to ease the workload of middle managers. Risk management consultants were brought in to review changes proposed to the Meissner plant before start up. The main office block was taken out of use.The implications with regard to off-site emergency planning have been reviewed.External to the Establishment:As above. Risk assessment consultants have also been commissioned to review all other chemical manufacturing processes on the site.

The reactor was put out of service and a slow pressurization with process gases (hydrogen and nitrogen) was carried out at ambient temperature. It was necessary to carry out many pneumatical cycles of pressurization and depressurization because of leaks from some flanges. After any cycle, the bolts of the flanges were tightened and a purging with nitrogen at 8 ate was carried out. Finally, a slow pressurization (20 minutes before the explosion occurred the internal pressure was about 250 kg/cm2 at a temperature of about 20-30°C) with process gases was in progress at ambient temperature when, suddenly, an explosion occurred. 3 people were operating inside the plant when the explosion occurred: 1 of them was killed and a second one was in a state of shock. The explosion destroyed the upper part of the column and metallic parts of the reactor were thrown in a radius of many metres around it.

Immediately after the bromine release, a watchman activated the emergency stop. The shut-off valve closed within approx. 3 s. Only that part of the bromine was released which had already passed the highest point of the pipe.The bromine was collected by bottom containment system. After 30-40 s the fire fighting team could stop the evaporation of the bromine by covering the bromine with a layer of water.At 13:46, another alarm was released.The pipe section between the highest point of the pipe and the rail tanker was still filled with bromine. It is not known whether at this time any bromine had already penetrated into the double wall jacket. The leak check pipe ruptured. The leak was sealed with a blind flange (seal plate). 5-10 l of bromine were released, while due to the immediate measures taken by the fire fighting team abatement of the vapour) only a small fraction of the bromine was dispersed in the air.The released bromine was caught together with the water in the rail spill-containment system and in the containment system of the neighbouring hydrochloric acid tanks, so that it was not absorbed by the ground.In the meantime, the pressure in the rail tanker was reduced using a gas washer of a lithium bromide installation. Almost no bromine was released during this process. Subsequently, the remaining content of the inner pipe of the double wall pipe was transferred into the rail tanker. This reduced the hazards. According to a worst case scenario, at his time there were still ca. 30 l of bromine in the double wall jacket.The bromine inside the wagon was strongly heated by the sun shining on the black PE (polyethylene) double wall pipe. There was the risk of a rupture of the PE box near the shut-off valve. An attempt to reduce the pressure on the emptying valve before a receiving arm by shortly opening was aborted, because of the high temperature of the bromine a strong spontaneous evaporation occurred. Massive use of water avoided the diffusion of bromine vapour. After this emptying through a pipe connecting piece was chosen. Since mechanical strength (resistance) was not granted during the whole duration of the operation, additionally a funnel was placed underneath. During opening of the valve the pipe connecting piece broke off. Subsequently, the double jacket was washed with sodium sulphate solution. During this operation, there was a minor release of bromine, because a blind flange (seal pipe) had to be opened.","Off-site the concentrations were in the limits of the MAK- values and were therefore not critical for the population. A smell nuisance occurred and some persons suffered from inflammation of the eyes and the mucous membranes.
Material loss  was quantified in 1500 EURO.","The bromine was caught over a bottom containment system. After 30-40 s the fire fighting team could stop the evaporation of the bromine by covering the bromine with a layer of water. Another leak was sealed with a blind flange (seal plate). 5-10 l of bromine were released, while due to the immediate measures taken by the fire fighting team (abatement of the vapour) only a small fraction of the bromine was dispersed in the air.

During a storm at the end of the working period (most employees had already left the plant), two very powerful, successive explosions occurred in less than 5 seconds in the fusion cavity of the furnace, causing extensive damages to the foundations of the furnace. The first explosion, undoubtedly in the form of a detonation equivalent to 200 kg of TNT, fractured material, destroyed the casting frame and caused the essential part of the damages noted. It also caused the break of a cable in an ingot lowering machine and caused plates and aluminium alloy not dispersed by the electric arc to fall into the casting pit. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two second later. The first explosion could have generated a pressure of 10 to 20 bar on the sides of the pit, and the generated seismic wave was recorded by several seismographs in the region and furnished an energy undoubtedly at least 1,000 times greater than that of the electric arc produced in the building.An inquiry commission was rapidly formed after the accident and worked in close contact with and under the supervision of administrative and judicial authorities. It made use of the services of experts in the following fields: explosions, use of natural gas, prevention, meteorology and storms, metallurgy, civil, mechanical and electrical engineering, combustible dust. The analysis of statements and interviews indicated that a luminous phenomenon in the foundry, followed, almost immediately, by the first explosion and 2 seconds later by a second explosion. The examination of material in the foundry shop near the presumed starting point of the explosion showed that the motor of a mobile hoist located 15 metres from the supposed point of explosion presented indisputable traces of the passage of lightning-related current. In addition, it was possible to determine numerous possibilities for the routing of the current leading to the starting point of the explosion. In particular, the casting pit itself, where the explosion started, was the best grounding point in proximity to the motor. It was supposed that the molten aluminium alloy could have led to: either an explosion of aluminium alloy droplets dispersed in air (which involves a suspension process) or a reaction of molten aluminium with water. The first was opted for. The molten aluminium was suspended in air by the action of the shock wave produced by the electric arc. The shock wave dispersed 150-300 kg (of a total of 1,200 kg) of molten aluminium alloy around the casting frame in the form of a fog of fine droplets. Only a part of the energy of the shock wave was used in this dispersion process. The fog then exploded (as a detonation equivalent to 200 kg of TNT) as a result of the droplets/air reaction. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two seconds later, as a result of the rapid vaporization of cooling water in contact with the molten metal, which fell from the upper part of the casting pit. The first explosion fractured material, destroyed the casting frame and caused the essential part of the damages noted. It also caused the break of a cable in an ingot lowering machine and caused plates and aluminium alloy not dispersed by the electric arc to fall into the casting pit. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two second later. The first could have generated a pressure of 10 to 20 bar on the sides of the pit, and the generated seismic was was recorded by several seismographs in the region and furnished an energy undoubtedly at least 1,000 times greater than that of the electric arc produced in the building. Even if the foundry was equipped with natural gas piping for heating the furnaces, the hypothesis of the formation of a flammable mixture with air was excluded because of: the large volume of the flammable mixture necessary to explain the magnitude of the damages (no major leak was noted), the fact that the mixture would have accumulated in the upper part of the building (whereas damaged were on the ground) and the absence of heat effects resulting from a gas explosion.","CAUSES:

539,975,Near Miss,Chemical installations - other fine chemicals,Acetic acid and acetic anhydride leak at fine chemicals plant,2012-02-29 18:15:00,2012-02-29 00:00:00,"On 29 February 2012, an operating fault occurred during the manufacturing of a new product, resulting in one member of staff sustaining serious injuries. A new product was due to be manufactured for the first time at the plant according to a new production specification. After separating acetic acid and acetic anhydride by distillation in accordance with the new production specification, a controlled chemical reaction occurred whilst draining the acetic acid + acetic anhydride mix from a distillation condenser into an intermediate bulk container (IBC) for disposal. As a result of the uncontrolled reaction, the IBC was destroyed and approximately 200 l of acetic anhydride evaporated or formed a fine spray. A member of staff who happened to be in the affected area of the plant was seriously injured (eye and leg burns. First aid was administered. The district coordination centre was immediately informed and medical first aid was organised. The member of staff was taken to hospital). At the plant, the feed tubes to the distillation condenser were destroyed, as were the fluid pipes (nitrogen, control air, exhaust air) located near the feed point.
In the adjacent stairwell, a temporary window was broken.
Due to the disruption to liquid and gas supplies, production in the affected part of the plant and the rest of the plant had to be stopped. Continued operation at the plant was prohibited by the competent monitoring authority. Immediately after the incident occurred, first aid was administered to the injured member of staff and the district coordination centre was informed in accordance with the Operating Alarm and Security Plan (Betrieblicher Alarm- und Gefahrenabwehrplan, BAGAP). An associated member of staff was able to find a way to condense the leaked acetic acid + acetic anhydride vapour after donning the necessary personal protective equipment.
","The operational fault was not caused directly by the synthesis process but by shortcomings in the safe management of waste disposal. The following course of events was deduced based on current information:
- A replacement IBC was provided containing a sufficiently large quantity of contaminants (probably aniline compounds and water) the presence of which was not noticed when a basic visual inspection was carried out owing to its high viscosity or relatively firm ‘skin’ and its colour which resembled that of the IBC.
- The viscosity, poor miscibility with the distillate and/or firm surface of the contaminant prevented the distillate from mixing quickly when drained.
- The resulting heat of the reaction in the IBC enabled diffusion to take place in the reaction system.
- Once the activation energy/start temperature was exceeded, a compound in the reaction mixture catalysed the chemical reaction between the contaminants and acetic anhydride.
- The heat could not be sufficiently dissipated, leading to a runaway reaction which caused sudden vaporisation of the contents of the IBC (thermal explosion).
- The pressure and temperature in the IBC increased very quickly. The IBC was destroyed due to pressure and thermal overload.

543,111,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Release of blast furnace gas at a blast furnace,2016-09-06 20:27:00,2016-09-06 20:31:00,"On 6 September 2016 an automatic system opened safety valves (‘bleeders’) at a blast furnace at around 20:27 for a period of approximately 4 minutes. The bleeders are located on a 86&nbsp;m platform and are the safety devices provided for in the blast furnace as described in the Partial Safety Report, which prevent and safely release an unacceptable overpressure in the blast furnace. This measure resulted in an emission perceptible from outside the factory (discharge of dusty blast furnace gas with audible flow noise).
Safety measure:Due to an as yet unidentified error within the redundant programmable memory controller (SPS) of the pressure measurement in the blast furnace’s risers, there was a fault in the process control system, which resulted in a system reset for pressure measurements being carried out in the measurement system. The previous fault had reduced the counter-pressure on the blast furnace to around 1 bar. The set point was 2.4 bar. As a result of this very large system deviation, the annular scrubber units in the gas purification process slammed shut. As a result, pressure built up in the upper furnace and the built-in safety features were triggered in the correct order:

The Snort Valve opened several times to reduce wind pressure.
The first bleeder opened when a pressure of approximately 3.1 bar was reached.
The opening of the bleeder released the furnace pressure safely into the atmosphere as expected.
The triggering of this safety system eliminates a serious risk for staff and local residents. When the bleeders closed at 20.31, the furnace pressure was again in the controlled range and the system was again in normal condition.

The safety system in place functioned correctly and without errors.","The pressure build-up in the blast furnace gas system and the response of the PCE monitoring device were caused by the failure of both logic modules of the redundant programmable memory controller. According to the manufacturer’s investigations, the cause of failure lies in errors in the internal address of the logic modules.&nbsp;
The reason for failure is, in the expert’s view, accidental errors.",External impacts: Audible flow noise for four minutes and soiling (of cars) causing &euro;500 in damage.Audible flow noise for four minutes.,"
The on-site fire brigade and relevant on-call teams were informed;
Issue of a D2 message by the on-site fire brigade, downgraded to D1 after a short period of time;
Press release;
Immediate report by telephone to the local government.

The soiling caused by falling dust was subsequently dealt with.","In particular, in comparable situations in future, the existing back-up system will be used until the SPS becomes available again after a restart. This has already been achieved by implementing an automatic switch to the back-up controller (with appropriate visualisation) in the event of an error in the standard system as an ad hoc measure.&nbsp;
During planned standstills in summer 2017, two additional pressure transmitters will be installed on the blast furnace gas risers. Their analogue readings will then be transmitted directly to the back-up controller as a 4-20 mA signal. The back-pressure can thus be controlled by the back-up controller independently of the SPS on the basis of separate measurements of the pressure in the risers.
The analogue data signals from the four existing pressure transmitters on the risers will also be routed via four independent isolation amplifiers in order to decouple the signals."

At the time of the accident, there were exceptionally high concentrations of highly inflammable ether in the atmosphere, which suddenly burst into flames. During the accident, which occurred in May 2012, two workers were injured, one of whom sustained severe burns. Tukes’ accident investigation detected deficiencies in the company's ability to assess chemical risks, implement changes and comply with instructions. ","The ignited material comprised ether/an ether-air mixture and recycled material. The gravity of the accident was increased by the high ether concentration in the air in the mixer room. No definitive reason for the fire was established in the investigation. The fire was caused either by static electricity or a hard bump which caused sparks.Factors having an impact on the high ether concentration in the room:• In the risk assessments carried out, the hazards of vaporized ether had mainly been regarded as a disadvantage in terms of occupational hygiene.• No attention had been paid to the ether content of the recycled material, and the risks involved were assumed to be similar to those of pure nitro-cellulose.• No efforts had been made to reduce the volume of ether in the gelatinization of the recycled material in connection with the filling of the mixers.• No efforts had been made to reduce the vaporization of ether in the recycled material barrels during their storage.• The ventilation operating principles in the gelatinization building were not fully understood.• The exhaust ventilation in the mixer room was not switched on while the mixer was being filled.• The ether contained in the recycled material had not been taken into account in the area classification of the mixer room.Factors having an impact on the fire:• Only conductive barrels should be used when handling the recycled material. A serious error was made in the introduction of recycled material barrels as a non-conductive barrel had been taken into recycled material use at some stage.• After modification work, problems were experienced in keeping the lid of the mixer open, and the barrel lifter structures may have bumped against the edge of the mixer.The organisation has solid traditions of carrying out risk analyses, but there is still room for improvement in risk assessments related to chemicals. In the risk analyses, fire risks had been identified, but the fire extinguishing systems were regarded as adequate for extinguishing a possible gunpowder fire. The volume of ether and the possibility of a quick, explosive fire as a result of the ether-air mixture had not been identified.The hazards related to the machinery and equipment used in the gelatinization process had been assessed from the viewpoint of machine safety, and decisions on remedial measures had been made on the basis of the hazard assessments carried out. The impacts of the changes on process safety had not been assessed. The company guidelines had been deviated from to a certain extent in the planning and implementation of the changes. As a result of the changes, the mixer encountered usability problems, which had not been fully repaired during the past year. Repair measures were delayed by a lack of clarity in the flow of information between employees and supervisors and ambiguity concerning repair measures between the client and the outsourced maintenance staff.In the past few years, there have been many personnel changes in the organization and maintenance has been outsourced. These have had an impact on the functionality, expertise and flow of information in the organization.The organization has a management system along with guidelines. As a rule, the system and the guidelines function well. However, the guidelines are not fully observed at all levels of the organization, and this deficiency has not been tackled. In safety-critical operations, this is a serious shortcoming that undermines safe operations. In an operating system based on quality, environmental and occupational health and safety standards, there is also scope for specifying the industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and process safety. ","An explosive fire producing extremely high temperatures broke out in connection with the gelatinisation of recycled material in gunpowder factory. The fire was put out quickly once the fire extinguishing system was activated. Two employees were injured in the fire, one of whom sustained serious burns. ","The fire was put out quickly once the fire extinguishing system was activated. Simultaneusly automatic alarm was sent. Fire and resque services, ambulance and police like represetants of the company arrived. Workers gave first aid by undressing the victims and rinsing with the water.","The investigation team proposes the following measures to prevent similar accidents. The recommendations are general, concerning the entire industry and similar projects.Recommendations for the purposes of supervision and the industry:• Guidelines should be observed. Regular training on the operational guidelines should be organized and it must be supervised so that the employees become acquainted with and comply with the guidelines. Important operational guidelines in terms of safety include organizational responsibilities, identification and assessment of hazards, change management, work instructions and management of deviations.• Procedures and guidelines based on quality, and environmental and occupational health and safety standards presented in the operating system should be specified from the viewpoint of industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and process safety. The (major accident) hazards related to them should be identified and managed in a systematic way. The functionality of the management system should be ensured and the development needs should be systematically identified also in terms of the industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and process safety.• The organization's functionality should be ensured in connection with organizational, personnel and process changes and when responsibilities change. The operating system should be kept up-to-date.• The persons in charge at the production plant and those planning and implementing the changes should be acquainted with the organization’s change management procedures, which should be followed when changes are made in the production plant.• The protection plan should be developed in line with preventive risk management; the current nature of the protection plan is to react strongly to accidents.• In hazard identification and risk assessment, chemical safety should also be taken into account with the same degree of importance as explosives safety. The assessment team must include members with expertise in chemicals and the production process, and employees at the work site must be consulted.• It must be ensured that the employees are familiar with the work instructions and risk factors in their workplace and are able to identify them. Guidelines should be provided for the supervision of compliance with the safety and work instructions.• The processing of safety observations must have a follow-up procedure that motivates the employees to make safety observations.• Guidelines are to be drawn up for health and safety know-how and training procedures, and it should be ensured that the training needs for the personnel at the production plant are identified and determined in safety-related issues as well. Safety training should also be maintained and recorded.• The flow of information between contract partners operating in the plant area and the plant’s personnel should be ensured.• Guidelines concerning the reaction to alarms are to be specified further. The causes of and reasons for alarms and the measures carried out should be recorded. The frequency of alarms should be monitored and the reason for recurring alarms should be tackled.• The monitoring of ongoing requirements by the authorities should be included as part of the systematic monitoring of deviations so that the requirements issued by the authorities are met within the specified time, or additional time can be applied for if necessary. Recommendations for the inspection body:• The validity of the area classification should be verified in connection with electrical inspections.Recommendations for focusing and developing Tukes’s supervision and communication:• During periodic inspections, the functionality of the operating system and the awareness and observance of guidelines should be verified at all organizational levels.• Risk management regarding the industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and the special characteristics of process safety compared with the safety systems related to quality control, environmental and occupational health should be emphasized in supervision and communications.Recommendations for the development of legislation:• The application of chemical legislation in the manufacture of explosives is to be clarified. The legislation should also support chemical safety in the explosives industry.• The area classifications concerning explosive air mixtures and explosives applied in the explosives industry are to be clarified."
545,60,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Gas plant explosion,1998-09-25 12:30:00,1998-09-27 00:00:00,"​A major explosion and fire occurred at Esso’s Longford gas processing site in Victoria, Australia. Two employees were killed and eight others injured. During the morning of Friday 25 September 1998, a pump supplying heated lean oil to heat exchanger GP905 in Gas Plant No. 1 went offline for four hours, due to an increase in flow from the Marlin Gas Field which caused an overflow of condensate in the absorber. (The plant was complex and the hot oil pump was only one component involved in the accident process; why the pump shutdown is complicated and important.) A heat exchanger is a vessel that allows the transfer of heat from a hot stream to a cold stream, and so does not operate at a single temperature, but experiences a range of temperatures throughout the vessel. Temperatures throughout GP905 normally ranged from 60 °C to 230 °C (140 °F to 446 °F). Investigators estimated that, due to the failure of the lean oil pump, parts of GP905 experienced temperatures as low as −48 °C (−54 °F). Ice had formed on the unit, and it was decided to resume pumping heated lean oil in to thaw it. When the lean oil pump resumed operation, it pumped oil into the heat exchanger at 230 °C (446 °F)—the temperature differential caused a brittle fracture in the exchanger (GP905) at 12.26pm.
About 10 metric tonnes of hydrocarbon vapour were immediately vented from the rupture. A vapour cloud formed and drifted downwind. When it reached a set of heaters 170 metres away, it ignited. This caused a deflagration (a burning vapour cloud). The flame front burnt its way through the vapour cloud, without causing an explosion. When the flamefront reached the rupture in the heat exchanger, a fierce jet fire developed that lasted for two days.
The rupture of GP905 led to other releases and minor fires. The main fire was an intense jet fire emanating from GP905. There was no blast wave—the nearby control room was undamaged. Damage was localised to the immediate area around and above the GP905 exchanger.","The fire and explosion was caused by a cold brittle fracture of a heat exchanger. The immediate cause was a process upset in which the temperature of the heat exchanger dropped much below normal levels. Operators had no idea of any potential dangers associated with such low temperatures and their actions led to thermal shock and catastrophic failure.This failure mechanism came completely unexpected.The official commission of inquiry criticised Esso, in one of its key findings, for not having carried out a systematic hazard identification of the plant.","The incident caused the destruction of Plant 1 and shutdown of Plants 2 and 3 at the site. Gas supplies were reduced to 5% of normal, resulting in 250,000 workers being sent home across the State as factories and businesses were forced to shutdown. This left the State of Victoria without natural gas supply for 9-19 days affecting millions of people, closing businesses and causing serious economic disruption.","The fire, which broke out following an explosion at 12:30 p.m. on September 25, burned for over two days before being declared extinguished on September 27.",Develop procedures for forseeable failures with significant consequences and train operators in these procedures Hazard identification and detailed study of failure types essential Safety Management Systems must be implemented and audited effectively Design alarm systems so that the number of alarms is appropriate (stop crying wolf) Control of escalation 
546,251,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion and fire from the release of a bursting disk of a polyethylene plant,1988-04-07 09:00:00,1988-04-07 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:During the start-up procedure after maintenance of the two stage compressor unit at the feeding section of a polyethylene plant, the pressure at the primary compressor discharge&nbsp; reached a value of 310 bar. Owing to pressure build-up, a bursting disc, located at the primary compressor discharge, burst at a somewhat lower pressure than expected (possibly owing to fatigue). As the bursting disc discharge piping had not been designed for the resulting dynamic pressure, it was torn from the collector release line. The released gas ignited, resulting in an explosion followed by a fire. The causes (a sketch of the system affected is also included in the original report) that led to the accident were:- the alarm signal was activated at approximately 265 bar and the primary compressor was stopped manually (about 300 bar);- the high-pressure switch at primary compressor discharge, which was supposed to cut off the primary compressor at 279 bar, failed;- the safety valve at primary compressor discharge worked as designed and opened gradually (between 297 and 328 bar) increasing its capacity with the pressure, but the full capacity was reached too slowly;- the bursting disc at primary compressor discharge burst at somewhat lower pressure than expected (possibly owing to fatigue);- the bursting disc discharge piping had not been designed for the resulting dynamic pressure and was torn from the collector release line.",The causes of the accident were:- failure of the primary compressor to shut-down when manually stopped;- failure of the high-pressure switch to operate at 279 bar;- failure of the pressure safety valve to reach the full capacity in a short time;- failure of the bursting disc discharge piping to withstand to the resulting dynamic pressure the disc burst.The underlying causes were an inadequate design plant and an insufficient testing procedures of the high-pressure switch.,"MATERIAL LOSS:The cost of the structural damages to the plant caused by the explosion and the fire has been estimated at about 40,000 euros. The production losses has been estimated at several millions of euros.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The emergency shut-down of the entire system was activated and the fire alarm was sounded. The company fire brigade intervened and cooled the unit by means of fixed extinguishing installations.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still necessary, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- redimensioning of the pressure safety valve and discharge lines of the safety devices;
2- improved testing about the performance of the high-pressure switch;
3- practical tests of a new design using nitrogen."
547,805,Other Event,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Fire and explosions occurred in a soluble sulphur production plant,1999-06-14 18:15:00,1999-06-14 20:15:00,"A fire and 2 explosions occurred in a soluble sulphur production plant, caused by successive ignition of powder clouds created by local overheating. The drying vaporiser and silo caught fire, and the washing water pipes were destroyed.","The accident happened as follows: the primary material, which contains sulphur, was stored in iron vats, thereby creating iron sulphites by reaction between the sulphur in the product and the iron in the containers. These substances are normally recycled in the plant's washing water, and an aerosol liquid is prepared by drying. The drying phase was very long, and an aerosol outlet nozzle was blocked, causing local overheating. All this, combined with a build-up of the substance at the base of the fluidised bed vaporiser, led to a large amount of substance, including iron sulphites, catching fire. The dust cloud, being within the vaporiser, then caught fire, and the fire spreads to the water washing equipment. The overpressure from the explosion damaged the water pipes. Among the equipment overheated was the valve nearest the water washer, which fell into the silo creating a dust cloud which then caught fire.",8 firemen were slightly affected by fumes during the extinction of the fire. There was damage to the  production unit.,"The plant firefighters started to work as soon as the fire was detected, but given the scale of the accident, the plant operator started the internal emergency plan (POI), and then subsequently the Departmental Prefect set into action the external emergency plan (PPI). The workers were evacuated as soon as the fire started. In total, 70 members of emergency services were involved.","The prevention and detection measures to be implemented aim at removing ignition sources and at detecting them as soon as possible if they should appear:1) more frequent cleaning of the vessel walls to avoid the formation of encrusted material2) installation of a filter on the fluidised bed heating equipment to avoid generating hot particles3) although the mechanism is not fully understood, the principal parameters governing the risk of exothermic reactions are the temperature, the amount of substance present, and the presence of iron. The preventive measures are therefore: reduction of temperature at start-up, detection of accumulation of substance by installing sensors, not stocking the product in iron vessels, and avoiding the re-injection into the process of recycled water, which can have a high sulphur content.The protection measures rely on the materials used in the installation being non-inflammable. It is therefore proposed:&nbsp;- that the first stage of the water washer and the ventilation ducts be built of non-inflammable material&nbsp;- that rapid-closing valves be installed between the fluidised bed vaporiser and the water washer (this is also to be applied to other vaporisers connected to the washer)&nbsp;- to review the location of the final product storage silos in relation to the water washer."
548,1210,Major Accident,"Waste storage, treatment and disposal",Fire and release of raw biogas from a fermenter at a biogas facility,2019-11-20 14:20:00,2019-11-20 17:15:00,"Two reports conclude that repair work on an agitator that was carried out by an external firm triggered a fire on the fermenter, which also spread to the adjacent secondary fermenter.Significant material damage resulted, though no-one was injured.
Sequence of events from expert reports:After checking and inspecting the technical components for defects/deficiencies of a material nature or that could cause a fire themselves, and after inspecting external influences, these could be excluded as a cause of the fire.
This leaves human error as the possible cause of the damage. According to the workflow outlined, the service technicians should have detached the connecting cable from the traction cable in order to replace the defective traction cable with a new one.This would have detached the cable of the agitator from its fastening/mount.After the traction cable was replaced, the agitator’s connecting cable should have been attached to the traction cable again. It seems that was either not done or it was not done correctly. The photos of the damage do not show the connecting cable reattached with the safety lock. This fastening of the connecting cable appears to have been forgotten after the replacement of the traction cable.This would explain how the connecting cable could get into the propeller of the agitator and be severed by it. The resulting severing of the connecting cable led to a short circuit that generated sparks. The resulting sparks ignited the gas in the fermenter. The oxygen concentration of the air/gas mixture in the fermenter was high enough at the time to ignite the gas and thus trigger the fire.
The connecting cable is secured to the traction cable with a stainless steel safety lock, which cannot become detached on its own. Likewise, the nature of the material rules out ageing or corrosion.
Safety measures:The fire brigade, police and ambulances were on site within a few minutes. According to the fire brigade, when they arrived the roofs were burning in just a few small places.A little extinguishing work put the fire out within a few minutes. Two of the fire brigades remained on site until around 17:15 to put out any subsequent fires if necessary (which proved not to be the case).So that was just a precautionary measure.",Repair work on an agitator (see trigger).,"Damages to the fermenter and the secondary fermenter.Material damages of around &euro; 200,000.","Road closed by the police; ambulances on site; fire brigade carried out firefighting and safety measures; incident notified to the State Office for Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Areas (Landesamt für Landwirtschaft, Umwelt und ländliche Räume - LLUR).The external company took an inventory.The works were carried out after consultation with the LLUR, the nature conservation authority and clearance from the consultant.","The above analysis of causes suggests that the existing precautionary measures are as effective as possible. We still cannot completely rule out the risk of human error in the future.Additional checks on the final assembly would further reduce the risk. The high level of specialisation of the contracted assembly company means that the top priority is in improved quality control within the assembly company, which is largely outside the control of the facility operator. The facility operator has indeed increased its general vigilance with regard to work done by external companies. The staff’s long years in the job should be particularly helpful in allowing them to use their experience to prevent risks in the future.Measures were taken to limit the impact, but it was not possible to prevent injury to the secondary fermenter. The materials used have now been given a fire-resistant finish (films) where possible. This is another constructive safeguard that may limit the effects of damage in the event of a future incident."

It was used in an air separation plant and for many years had only been used occasionally as a back up to the turbo compressor during peak load. The piston compressor had been switched on the previous day at 7.45 pm. It had therefore been on for approximately 16 hours at the time of accident. &nbsp;At 11.48 am strong vibrations were first observed, directly followed by an explosion at the compressor with a secondary fire. The machine shop was damaged as a result of the shock wave, projected parts, molten material, heat and fume condensation. There was no personal injury.","Compression of O2 from 150 mbar to 18 bar
 Temperature: inflow: 20 °C, discharge: 90-100 °CCause description:
The incident began inside the cylinder on stage 3 (most heavily used) most likely via the piston in the top  compression space. This is clear from the damage: dismantling of the system confirmed the first impression.
A metal fire must then have developed inside which spread by exploding outwards having melted the top wall of the cylinder. The fire was then apparently further fed by the oxygen flowing back out of the pipes until the stop valve of the pipe system was closed manually. There was evidence that the piston in stage 3 had jammed (piston rod twisted). It is likely that this seizure was a result of the primary cause, i.e. the piston got stuck and the piston rod was twisted as a result of the continued running (or trail ) of the machine.
The presumed cause is that parts inside the compressor broke up or off and then gathered on the piston. These broken parts were then beaten against the cover of the compressor compartment and consequently became warped, or alternatively got into the gap between the piston and the cylinder liner (also possible for parts bigger than the width of the gap around the valve opening) and were ground there. Both of these processes produce friction heat which ignited the fire.

This disproportionated slightly on heating above approx. 100° C and phosphine was formed. This escaped from the collecting tank via the air vent pipe and immediately combusted.Because of the methane that had likewise entered the condensate collecting tank, the fire spread to the plastic ducts of the air extractor fan.Owing to the increasing pressure in the collecting tank, this could no longer be removed via the air vent pipe, and the syphon of the collecting tank emptied into a reception pit in the production building.This resulted in phosphine and the contained methane being released from the syphon pipe, which ignited and set on fire the building's waste air duct, made of highly flammable polypropylene, close to the reception pit.The fire then spread along the entire waste air duct.&nbsp;Procedures were followed in accordance with the company’s alarm and hazard prevention plan (BAGAP) for the plant protection products facility and the corresponding plan of the chemical park.- Alert issued to the plant's fire service, and other fire services were also contacted.- Removal of production waste water and fire-fighting and surface water to a water-treatment plant;- Central Command notified, D3 notification, broadcasting in the chemical park, alerting with the use of sirens, press releases, environmental measurements, etc.",Technical failure of a heat exchanger owing to a manufacturing defect.,"Damage to the production building and the production facility.

Locking of the feed unit for phosphorus trichloride upstream of the heat exchanger in the event of the overfill warning alarm going off at the existing flow measuring point.
Enhanced quality assurance in future procurement of comparable heat exchangers.
Increase in the diameter of the vent line at the condensate collecting tank in order to prevent the syphon from emptying there and thereby to avoid any intake via the building’s air extraction system and prevent the possibility of fire breaking out and spreading in the exhaust duct.
Additional monitoring of the filling level in the syphon of the condensate collecting tank for improved detection of the syphon emptying.
Additional monitoring of methane in the vent line of the condensate collecting tank.
Installation of additional fire-protection equipment in the building’s air extraction system.

The fire, which broke out at 00.50 on 27 September 2014, developed like a pool fire, i.e. like a fire in a pool of fuel, and was therefore confined to the area of the tank roof that was in contact with the fuel. In the safety report, an accident of this kind was considered to be possible. The fire continued throughout the night and was extinguished at about 10.30 on 27 September 2014.","Malfunctioning of the floating roof, which failed to ensure the required leakproofness, thus allowing the substance to spill out onto the roof. It is not known what caused the virgin naphtha vapours to rise even though the control procedures had been activated.
&nbsp;","The accident resulted in damage to the plant as it involved TK&nbsp;513, the virgin naphtha it contained, the ducts connecting other equipment in the accident area to the tank, as well as the tank's containment and extinguisher systems.As the fire was a pool fire, the fuel&nbsp; was contained wholly within the area of the roof and thus burned solely on the floating caissons, the fire being confined within the internal walls of TK&nbsp;513. There were no spills or leakages into the containment basin, and no fire outbreak was recorded there.The company&rsquo;s statements and the measurements and inspections carried out by the local Environmental Protection Agency branch indicate that there was no immediate damage to the environment or to persons. The air quality monitoring units did not record significant variations in the pollutant concentrations measured.&nbsp; This accident resulted in over EUR&nbsp;2&nbsp;million worth of material damage within the plant. The material damage was inspected within the refinery and was due to:&nbsp; - the loss of 6&nbsp;000 tonnes (company estimate) of virgin naphtha in the tank, - the total destruction of floating-roof tank TK&nbsp;513, - damage to the tank&rsquo;s containment and extinguishing systems and to connecting pipes, - damage to one of the company&rsquo;s own firefighting appliances,&nbsp; - the clean-up and refurbishment of connecting devices, - the costs to be incurred in rebuilding the tank. According to the company, the consequences of the accident in terms of cost amount to about EUR&nbsp;14&nbsp;290&nbsp;000.00, including: - approx. EUR&nbsp;4&nbsp;500&nbsp;000.00 for the 6&nbsp;000 tonnes of virgin naphtha that burned;&nbsp; - approx. EUR&nbsp;9&nbsp;790&nbsp;000.00 for the decommissioning and subsequent rebuilding of TK&nbsp;513.During the fire, fire brigade and refinery staff attended to the tank and the tanks close to it, and these were monitored by checking the critical temperatures of the materials. Therefore, the tank did not collapse and spill its contents into the containment basin, but it buckled on one side at about 10&nbsp;m, of the initial 19&nbsp;m, from the base.The tank-roof fire developed despite the measures taken, but the accident did not affect other installations or persons. It is clear that, although functioning, the fixed and mobile firefighting systems used during the accident did not enable the emergency services to keep the fire under control and/or to extinguish the fire immediately after its outbreak.The Prefecture did not consider it necessary to put the external action plan (EEP) into action.","From 13.50 on 25 September 2014, the tank was being filled.
At about 9.30 on 26 September 2014, during a patrol they were making owing to the presence of odours, the operations staff detected the presence of virgin naphtha in a limited area of the tank roof. Checks were made immediately and showed that the product was escaping because the western side of the roof was starting to sink as it was taking in liquid from the pontoon sections on the same side.The filling of the tank was interrupted at about 9.40 on 26 September 2014.At about 10.30 on 26 September 2014, the refinery’s management decided to empty the tank as per the operating manual, in addition to implementing all the necessary preventive measures to ensure safety, namely: continuous attendance of firefighting vehicles; preventive covering of the product on the roof with a foam extinguisher; presence, in continuous shifts, of firefighting and technical operations teams for the emptying operation.The layer of extinguisher was applied to the product on the roof at about 10.45 on 26 September 2014.The operations staff started emptying TK&nbsp;513 at about 12.20 on 26 September 2014.In the hours that followed, the transfer of the product continued, whilst the layer of extinguishing foam was maintained by means of successive top-ups that were needed both to cover the product on the roof and owing to increased wind intensity.At about 0.45 on 27 September 2014, the fuel was found to have started leaking and then the fire to have broken out on the tank roof. The level of the tank was estimated to be about 5.5&nbsp;m (it had not been possible to gauge the level for several hours), corresponding to a volume of virgin naphtha of about 30&nbsp;000 m3. The internal emergency plan was put into action. The municipal and provincial fire brigades were notified.The tank’s fire protection (cooling and foam spraying) systems were activated immediately. The cooling systems of three adjacent tanks were turned on. The cooling systems of two tanks located further to the south, beyond the embankment of a former railway, were later also turned on. It was possible to keep tank shell temperatures under control with the aid of a thermal sensor. Firefighting equipment and perimeter hydrants were used to protect the lines of transfer of the product in TK&nbsp;513 from irradiance (north side), as was the rack to the south of the tank so as to prevent fire spreading to the vegetation on the trackbed of the former railway.The fire brigade arrived on the scene. At about 2.00 on 27 September 2014, transfer of the product in TK513, interrupted when the emergency arose, was resumed in order to minimise the quantity of product burned.At about 10.00 on 27 September 2014, the most intense phase of the fire seemed to have ended; there were far fewer flames but there was still some smoke activity. The tank's firefighting systems were found to be still active. The on-site and external firefighting teams remained in attendance and monitored the situation.The end of the emergency was declared at about 17.30 on 27 September 2014.On 28 September 2014, the situation was stable, with just one spot fire in the south side of the tank. In the meantime, the cooling of the tank shell, using the cooling ring and monitors, and the removal of the product both continued, although the pump was activated discontinuously by the operator.Traces of smoke could still be detected in the air.From 04.00 to 09.00 on 29 September 2014 there was a resurgence of smoke due to a number of residual spot fires.There was another resurgence of smoke at approx. 9.00-14.00 on 30 September 2014, again due to a number of residual spot fires.&nbsp;In response to this, action is being taken, together with the provincial fire brigade HQ, to put in place fixed foam spraying systems with mounted monitors (including two high-power (7&nbsp;000 and 10&nbsp;000 lt/min) systems) in order to extinguish residual spot fires more quickly.It was then decided to revert to cooling the shell and draining the tank.At about 23.00 on 3 October, all the spot fires had been extinguished.The company stated that the internal emergency plan (IEP) had been put into action immediately and had dealt with the emergency. As decided by the Prefecture, the external emergency plan (EEP) was not put into action.","The refinery’s February 2015 analysis of the incident highlighted the need to reassess the frequency of potential accidents arising in the storage tank area when updating the safety report.Following the accident, the control authority has imposed the following measures on the plant operator:- installation of suitable detection systems capable of promptly alerting the control room to tank roof anomalies (installation on all floating-roof atmospheric tanks of a floating roof monitoring system capable of assessing the slope of the roof),- checks on roofs, caissons, ladders and tank drainage systems,- development of a special monitoring plan for floating-roof tanks with reference to standard API 653, check list appendix C- regular planning of dimensional measurements,- revision of the procedure for inspecting and maintaining tanks for hydrocarbon products"

A man was found lifeless outside near the factory buildings 15th March 2012. The exact time of the event is unkonwn, but the worker was found at 9:20. Accident had no eye witnesses, but it is assumed that the worker had died because of breathing hydrogen sulfide. Elevated concentrations of hydrogen sulfide were detected in the area after the accident in the yard at the plant. Casualty had not use a gas gauge or a gas mask.",The accident investigation revealed deficiencies in the company's process safety management.The technical cause of the accident was the reaction caused by limestone slurry which was automatically pumped to the storage tank resulting in a discharge of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide into the air.A valve was left open and limestone slurry was leaking to the floor. Slurry ended to the floor drain from where it was pumped to the storage tank. Alkaline slurry and acidic solution in the tank reacted and carbon dioxide was released. Carbon dioxide filled the gas space of the tank and carbon dioxide with hydrogen sulfide were released into the air. Weather was calm and the concentration of hydrogen sulfide remained high. The worker without gas mask died. ,One worker died. The accident had no effects on the environment or property.,"The company had an internal emergency plan. Rescue operations were practised systematically, but the focus of the exercises was not on hydrogen sulfide accidents. The main responsibility for emergency response is on the company's fire department, because the distance to regional rescue service is long. Contractor's workers saw the casualty lying on the ground at 9.20 am. They moved the casualty further away and started to give first aid. Company's fire department got the emergency call at 9.30 am and they arrived at the scene of the accident at 9.35 am. Company's fire department continued first aid but finally found casualty dead.

This option is based on a historical risk analysis and without experience of the valve opening accidentally. Congestion formed as a result of the humidity in the distribution system of the valve and a temperature of -3°C, thereby limiting the passage of air.&nbsp; The operator had not realised that the valve could cause releases of VCM into the air, except as part of its safety functions.
The release continued for 5 hours, because the valve responsible for it was not identified immediately. This valve is not equipped with a discrepancy alarm (difference between order and actual status). Furthermore, its exhaust is not fitted with the means to measure outgoing VCM. The operating team assumed that leaks from the valves of two autoclaves were the cause of the release of VCM. They interpreted the low readings on the gas meter as being caused by failure of the compressor by-pass valves. The operating team misinterpreted the incident because of incomplete instructions and a lack of information on the screens in the control room and on the schematic diagrams available on the process monitoring software.
Furthermore, the site’s standby staff was not immediately informed of the ongoing incident. The risk analysis for the site does not identify a scenario in which VCM is released on the degassing line.",It is estimated that 3.4&nbsp;t of gaseous VCM leaked over a period of 5&nbsp;hours. The east-to-west direction of the wind directed the VCM plume towards the inside of the site.,"Between 02:45 and 09:00, at a plastics factory classified as an upper-tier Seveso establishment, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) was released from a VCM degassing and condensation circuit. At 02:25, a valve in the degassing circuit opened. Between 02:45 and 04:45, the low-level alarm of the gas meter was activated and the compressors shut down. At the same time, the VCM readings on the chromatography detectors in a workshop where the degassing reactors are located showed concentrations of between 5 and 10 ppm. The operators noted that the valves of 2 autoclaves were leaking. They tightened the valves and made a request for maintenance. Around 08:00, a spike of 12&nbsp;ppm of VCM was detected in the roof area of a laboratory near the condensation unit. The control room was confined. At 08:50, the day shift noticed billows above the degassing section. At 09:00, the teams on duty manually closed the valve in question, which had been left open. The release of VCM was stopped.","The operator will make all the operating teams aware of this incident and of the action plan prepared on the basis of the cause-consequence analysis made after the incident. In particular, it intends to:

check ‘sensitive’ equipment capable of causing VCM to be released into the atmosphere, carry out a HAZOP analysis of the systems in which they are integrated, set in place specific monitoring of this equipment and systematically launch an incident report if there is a malfunction involving this equipment. Additional actions may be identified on completion of the HAZOP analysis, such as checking that the equipment is used in accordance with suppliers’ recommendations;
make the operating teams aware of the need to carry out incident reporting and use the lessons learned from this incident to make recommendations for the future;
add alarms on valves that may lead to a release of VCM;
review and create different ‘alarm data sheets’ to cover situations that, until now, have rarely or never occurred on the site.
standardise the process monitoring software in order to identify potential failures more easily;
add information on the schematic diagrams and on the screens in the control room;
update the procedure for alerting the site’s standby staff.

As a result of this incident 16 people suffered from irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract.Cause/sequence of events: 
power failure resulting in a fault in conventional operation.
&nbsp;Description of incident: 
&nbsp;On 17/03/2004 work was carried out in the 220 kV REW transformer
station. Following completion of this work, there was a 3-pole earthed
short circuit at 4.14 pm due to a mistake by a REW worker whilst
reconnecting disconnected components. One of the three power supply
networks in the plant failed as a result. Gas turbine 1 in the south
RWE power station, which is necessary for establishing an insular
supply within the plant, unexpectedly failed 180 milliseconds after the
short circuit. This was the result of a malfunction in the regulatory
auxiliary supply. The automatically activated isolated operation
crashed a few seconds after the failure of gas turbine 1 as a result of
overloading. This caused the dependent auxiliary energies (compressed
air, nitrogen, cooling water) to break down. The plant's third network
was not affected.
The power supply was restored after approx. 10 minutes and the procedure was completed another 15 minutes later.
The emergency shut-down of the plants obliged to activate the flare
systems producing noise and soot plumes, although this did not have any
other external harmful effects on the environment.
When the installations started up again, there were unpleasant
ammonia/armine odours for a short period of time in the vicinity. 16
people sought outpatient treatment as a result. Two residents
complained of feeling unwell and received medical advice.
","Cause status: following inspection of the 220 kV transformer station, the earthing was not removed by RWE's service team;
Cause classification: earthing not removed from 220 kV transformer station.
","Material damage inside the installation: the damage caused by the emergency shut-down of the processing installations is estimated to be over 2,000,000 euro.","Safety function: the safety systems reacted as planned;&nbsp;Emergency shut-down secured the processing plants, flares started up and systematic shut-down of installations;&nbsp;Emergency measures: Safety measures:&nbsp; the emergency shut-down procedure secured the processing plants;&nbsp;Damage repaired:&nbsp; repair of the damageSafety measures by ext. emergency services: public in neighbouring areas alerted by fire brigade.","Measures to prevent recurrence: Immediate measures:- It was agreed with RWE that on-site switching operations and safety measures in the 220 kV transformer station are to be performed by two RWE workers. In addition, for the time being a company employee will be present to observe these measures. The work to be performed will be defined in a checklist and documented immediately after completion of the work..- The communication system between RWE and the company's power control room has been further improved.- RWE has technically modified the excitation equipment regulator for the gas turbines in such way that brief voltage drops in the generator should no longer cause blackouts.Further measures:- The availability of the cooling water supply is to be improved, and in particular the capacity to start up more quickly after a blackout. The same goes for the compressed air and nitrogen supply.- Further consideration is being given to improving the breathing air supply network, but no conclusion has yet been reached. The current system has a reserve of approx. 10 minutes. - Possible improvements to the compressor cooling system in the air separation plant are also to be investigated.- Regulation of the safety setting of flares in the event of power failures must be reviewed. It may be necessary to fit manual valves on certain flares to manually regulate the air/vapour supply. "

Probably the leakage started on the 19th of February 2005 and increased up to an amount of approximately 200 kilograms an hour on the day (27th of February) the leakage was discovered. On the whole the leakage was 120 kilograms an hour resulting in a loss of 22 tons of highly flammable hydrocarbons. The amount of highly flammable substances is the reason to report this accident.
","Probable cause is condensation of water in the transport gas. The transport gas that contains CO2, reacted with the water forming CARBON DIOXIDE. The CARBON DIOXIDE damaged the inside of the pipe. Most locations had been equipped with steel to prevent the erosion. In this case they had not expected the damage to take place on that exact location.",The pipe is situated rather high above the ground level. This part of the pipe is not inspected during the regular internal inspections/checks.Affected Area: installation,"As soon as the leakage was discovered it has been solved with placing a temporary leak repair pipeline enclosure (clamp). As it did not completely close the pipe later on that week one placed a custom made pipeline clamp. Afterwards extra checks were undertaken in which the company monitors the clamp placed around the pipe. Official action taken - other official action: Preliminary research by the Labour Inspectorate has been undertaken. Further research is considered not to be necessary at this point.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Working procedures can
take a focus on: Regular check ups of the equipment in the plant is
necessary, also if that equipment is placed high above the ground.

573,45,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Operator killed by explosion in a batch reactor  while filling through open manhole,2006-06-02 00:00:00,2006-06-02 00:00:00,"The accident, its development and consequencesOn the 2nd of June 2006, an operator was killed by an explosion in a batch reactor. At the time of the accident, he was closing the manhole of the reactor after loading solid raw materials through the manhole. The manhole lid was blown off by the explosion in the reactor and hit the operator in the face. The operator died instantaneous. The manhole was found several meters from the reactor. The sprinklers in the production building were automatically activated by the fire in the reactor. Neighbouring equipment was slightly damaged due to projectiles from the explosion. The accident had no consequences for the environment or for the surroundings.Process descriptionThe reactor is the first step in the batch production of polyesteracrylates. In the reactor polyols are esterificated with acrylic acid. This endothermic reaction is operated at ambient pressure and at a temperature between 80°C and 120°C. The process exists of different consecutive steps in different equipment (reaction, washing, filtration, stripping and concentration) and needs many manual interventions by the operator. The installations are located in a closed building.The accident happened in the loading phase of the reactor, which consists of:- loading of liquid catalyst from an isobulkcontainer (IBC). It is sucked in the reactor by putting the reactor under vacuum. This is done manually at the reactor.- manual loading of small quantities of solid raw materials (prepared in buckets) through the manhole- loading of solvent (toluene) from the bulk tank (controlled by DCS)- loading of acrylic acid from a bulk storage tank (controlled by DCS).The reaction is controlled by the process computer (DCS) through the flow rate of acrylic acid and the temperature. The operator checks the pH of a sample of the reaction product to determine whether the reaction is completed. If so, the product is transferred to the wash vessel and the reactor is rinsed with the solvent toluene, which is afterwards also added to the wash vessel. The reaction product and the wash toluene are transferred to the wash vessel using compressed air.","Accident scenario &amp; causesTwo of the three components of the fire triangle were with certainty present at the time of the explosion:- OxygenThe process was operated in oxygen containing atmosphere (ambient air). According to the company, in the initial design this was judged to be necessary to assure the acrylic acid inhibitor to inhibit the undesired autopolymerisation of the acid. - Flammable substanceThe reactor is washed with toluene between two batches. After the washing, there are still toluene vapours present in the reactor. Calculations performed by the company before the accident estimate the concentration of the toluene/air mixture at approx. 5 vol%. Given the explosion limits of toluene of 1.2 vol% and 7 vol% at ambient temperature, the reactor contained an explosive toluene/air mixture in the gas phase when the operator was manually loading raw materials through the open manhole. The ignition of the toluene/air mixture is most likely due to an unwanted chemical reaction between the raw materials that were loaded manually through the manhole of the reactor. Laboratory tests performed during the accident investigation identified a reaction between three of the five manually loaded solids. The heat production rate is low at ambient temperature but raises rapidly from 70°C on. At 90-100°C, a violent exothermic reaction occurs with the production of carbon oxide, carbon dioxide and phosphine. Phosphine&nbsp; autoignites at 100°C. The explosion was most likely an explosion of the toluene/air mixture in the reactor, ignited by the auto-ignition of phosphine. Because the solid materials are added to a nearly empty reactor (contained only 100 litre of liquid catalyst), they could accumulate at the reactor wall below the manhole. This wall is supposed to have been at a temperature around 80°C, since the previous batch was stopped at 80°C and based on evidence that the cooling was not turned on before the operator started the loading of the next batch. This means that the reactor wall was at a temperature very close to the start of the runaway reaction between the solids.The company claims that the normal operation was to load one third of the solvent before the manual addition of the additives. This would have avoided the accumulation of the solids to the reactor wall and hence the runaway reaction igniting the toluene vapour.However the loading sequence was not clearly defined in the batch cards and instructions. Furthermore, the process computer software was not in accordance with the sequence supposed to be followed by the operators. During the last 15 years, several modifications were introduced (E.g. loading the solvent in two steps to avoid splashing when adding solid catalyst and raw materials,&nbsp; change from solid to liquid catalyst). As a consequence, operators often only launched the new batch on the process computer after having loaded the catalyst and the solid raw materials. Since the cooling of&nbsp; the reactor is only automatically activated by the DCS once the start of a new batch is launched on the process computer, this deviation in the loading procedure implied that the reactor was not cooled during manual loading unless the operator started the cooling manually. The normal sequence implies an exposure to toluene vapours when loading the raw materials during the manhole. This exposure issue was formally identified by the company in risk and work place studies since 2001. Operators were supposed to wear breathing protection masks, but this was not formally and strictly imposed nor supervised. Due to the lack of clear batch cards and instructions and the lack of supervision by management, the loading sequence differed from shift to shift and even between operators of the same shift. As for the sequence followed by the victim, some of the operators intended to avoid toluene exposure - and thus the need of wearing a breathing mask - by adding the toluene after all the manual loading via the manhole. The risk study on the process was incomplete:- not all process steps were addressed (E.g. toluene washing of the reactor between two batches)- the explosion risk was not adequately evaluated (only measures to avoid ignition source, no question whether oxygen was really needed during the loading phase)- the loading sequence was not investigated (was supposed to be correct and followed in practice)- not all risks were identified (dangerous reactions between raw materials, use of compressed air for the transfer of solvents between vessels).An incident in July 2003 on a similar reactor indicated possible dangerous reactions between the solid raw materials.&nbsp; The follow up of the conclusions of the incident investigation was insufficient. A project aiming addition of all raw materials with closed systems (hoppers) and working in lean air conditions was planned for implementation later in 2006. The organisational changes within the company over the last years significant influenced the delay in taking technical improvement measures. The establishment changed of legal entity mid 2004 with a view of being taken over by a worldwide group, with a freezing of investments as a consequence. The take over in 2005 lead to significant changes on management level and staffing.&nbsp; The safety management system, which was in process of being adapted to the SMS guidelines of the new group who took over the company, did not assure an evaluation of the impact on safety of this kind of organisational changes. ",One deadAffected Area: Affected Area: installation,"
Fire was limited to inside of the reactor.
Victim was killed instantanious.
Main intervention was securing the installation and cleaning up
","Lessons learned:

All process hazards, including all possible dangerous interactions between chemicals, should be identified.
Risk studies on batch processes should consider all process steps and conditions.
Measures eliminating the existence of an explosive atmosphere should always have priority to measures preventing the ignition of that atmosphere.
Loading of products through an open manhole into flammable atmosphere is not good practice.
Recommendations of risk studies and incident investigations need to be followed up systematically.
The safety responsibilities and duties of management should be clearly identified.
Work instructions should be clear and periodically reviewed and actualised.
The process control system should correspond to the intended process method.
All changes to the process and process working methods should be evaluated as to their impact on safety (management of change procedure).
The management of change procedure should also address changes in organisational structure or in staff.

Actions taken/imposed:

The lean air project was implemented before restart up of the production lines. Other processes involving opening of manholes where identified and were only accepted to start up again if no flammable substances were involved.
Raw materials are added via closed systems.
Buckets are replaced by closed recipients.
All process risk studies will be revised and completed within a short time period. Priorities for the risk analysis program were made based on hazard potential of the processes involved.
The adaption process of the safety management system to the guidelines of the new group is accelerated and expected to be complete before the end of 2006, correcting at the same time the shortcomings identified in the accident investigation.
Management will be instructed on safety responsibilities and duties.

At 1.50 p.m. flames were seen coming from a flue. Two distinct events were taking place: a loss of steam supply throughout the platform and a fire in a furnace of the steam cracker unit.
&nbsp;","A general loss of electric power, followed by a loss of backup power, cut the steam supply to the platform and, in particular, to the steam cracker unit, consequently causing flaring. The steam supply was re-established at around 5.30 p.m., but it was not enough to end the flaring, as several boilers remained idle. The operator’s strategy of steam load shedding consisted in cutting the steam supply first to the flares, which was necessary to improve combustion, and then to the production units. Flaring was finally reduced by restarting the production installations and starting up the secondary boilers.
The loss of electric power was caused by defects in junction boxes between two sections of thick buried cables. An expert is examining those boxes to determine the causes of the defects.
The fire in the furnace of the steam cracker unit started when the tubes where the hydrocarbons circulate broke and fell to the bottom of the furnace. It would seem that the hydrocarbons then caught fire. The loss of steam shut down the furnace suddenly, which in turn led to thermal chock and damage to the tubes.
&nbsp;","A total of 1,440 t of hydrocarbons were flared over a period of two days.
&nbsp;","The operator launched its internal emergency plan at 2.30 p.m. As a preventive measure, the police blocked traffic on the D110 road, which runs next to the site. The internal emergency services and firefighters set up a command post to monitor the situation. The operator cut the hydrocarbon supply to the steam cracker furnace, which gradually lowered the intensity of the fire.&nbsp;The installations downstream of the furnace were purged with nitrogen, the fire was controlled and the furnace made safe at about 3.00 a.m. the following morning. In order to offset the loss of steam, the site operator restarted the boilers at around 5.30 p.m. The prefecture and the operator issued a joint press release at around 6.00 p.m. The internal emergency plan was lifted the following morning at 7.30 a.m. By restarting the boilers it was possible to reduce flaring, but black smoke was visible until the following day.
&nbsp;","The operator suggested the following improvements:

Reviewing its steam load shedding strategy in order to limit emissions into the air from the flares;
Evaluating the functioning of the steam cracker in case of loss of steam.

576,254,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Accident occurred during maintenance in the chlorine transfer circuit of an electrolytic industry for the production of organo-halogens and salts,1989-06-06 04:45:00,1989-06-06 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The accident occurred during maintenance in the chlorine transfer circuit. The accident case history was as followed:- 03:20 Production stopped.- 04:00 Clearing of tank V-2500 (see diagram No 2 attached to the Original Report) from liquid chlorine (pumped into buffer tanks).- 04:30 The remaining liquid chlorine in the heater section was (supposed to be) released to tank V-2504 (see diagram No 2). After the accident it was concluded that this step must have been executed in a too short period of time and only a partial boil-off of liquid chlorine resulted. So this section was still containing some liquid chlorine which was heated to about 80°C.- 04:45 An attempt was made to free the heater section E-2504 (see diagram No 2) from (residual) chlorine by the introduction of pressurized air. The presence of a one-way valve may not have been recognized (see diagram No 2). It resulted in chlorine inlet into the process air system. Process air system (7 bara) was responsible for chlorine distribution and emission in about 12 different sites on the plant. Therefore, chlorine emission occurred via several in- and outdoors sources.- 04:55 Chlorine detectors (limited to shipping and compression areas) intervened (chlorine concentrations up to 0.8 ppm during the accident) resulting in the automatic cut off of the equipment.- 05:00 The air supply to the heater was manually closed (although the cause of chlorine leakage was not known, possible chlorine sources were blocked in).

The mixture then ignited probably because of electric discharges caused by movement of the drainage hose (which was probably not made of antistatic material), or because of sparks from non-ATEX equipment found near the manhole, or because of improper mobile phone use in the basin area.
The causes mentioned can be put down to management shortcomings essentially linked to: inadequate training of internal and external staff, unsuitable operating procedures and inadequate risk analysis of the work to empty the tanks containing flammable liquids."

581,88,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Release of dust and blast furnace gas from the blast furnace of a smelting works,2013-08-17 01:04:00,2013-08-17 00:00:00,"There is a causal link between the incident on 17&nbsp;August 2013 and an interruption in the operation of a blast furnace at the smelting works on 11&nbsp;August 2013.At approximately 6.50 p.m. on 11&nbsp;August 2013, hot blast (i.e. hot air at approx. 1&nbsp;100&nbsp;°C enriched with oxygen) escaped from the hot blast collecting pipe of a hot stove.The hole rapidly burned to a size of about 1&nbsp;m. There was a loud noise due to both the hole and the pressure of about 3.0 bar in the hot blast collecting pipe. Since the pipe is lined with refractory bricks, bricks were ejected from the damaged part of the pipe.The blast furnace was immediately shut down and made safe. The site of the incident was cooled by the plant fire service. The fire brigade was alerted and was on site.No one was injured. At no time was there any risk to the environment around the smelting works.Since the blast furnace was shut down at short notice, it could not be prepared for start-up, as normally happens in the case of scheduled shutdown procedures. When a scheduled shutdown of a blast furnace is performed, a ‘damping batch’ (increased coke rate) is introduced into the furnace about eight hours before the stoppage, which compensates for the energy lost during start-up.Because there was no damping batch and heat was lost during the five or so days when the furnace was shut down to repair the damaged area, the batch became caked and it was difficult to pass gas through the batch column in order to start up the blast furnace.After being repaired, the blast furnace was put back into operation at around 6.00 a.m. on 16&nbsp;August 2013. In the process, the hot blast was initially only fed to the furnace via 12 of the 30 tuyeres in order to allow gas to be passed through the batch column.After operation was resumed, in the night between Friday and Saturday, one ‘blow-through’ lasting 19&nbsp;seconds occurred at 1.04&nbsp;a.m. and another, lasting 45&nbsp;seconds, at 3.38&nbsp;a.m. This was caused by the sudden formation of a channel in the batch column as the batch slipped down the column, leading to disruption of the flow distribution and thus to a sudden increase in pressure, causing the tap holes to open. The tap holes are pressure safety valves pursuant to professional standard BGV C20 in the upper part of the blast furnace.Dust and blast furnace gas were released during the ‘blow-through’.&nbsp;
There are a total of four tap hole valves (pressure relief valves) on the blast furnace gas pipeline. The valves serve as a safety device to prevent excess pressure. The blast furnace has three tap holes, which open in succession as a function of the pressure. The fourth tap hole is opened manually only during shutdown.","Excess pressure in the blast furnace, see triggers/sequence of events.","Contamination of cars, houses, garden furniture, etc. (approximately 160 buildings/outdoor facilities and 270 cars were affected).",Restoration of damage caused,Sharing experience with other blast furnace operators in order to take additional measures if necessary.

Caused by an unclear instruction, another pressure indicator with a similar number was removed. This indicator was installed again. During this activity, it was observed that acrylic acid vapours, being released out of the opened installation, crystallised immediately on the flange surface.When the production installation was started again, a pump tripped each time because the mounted pressure indicator deviated and gave high pressure alarm. The installation was then stopped because bridging of the pressure indicator was necessary. After bridging, the pressure indicator was inspected. It was found that the flange of the pressure indicator was leaking. Production was asked to solve the leakage. Production operators closed the manual valve underneath the instrument and unscrewed the bolts of the flange. When removing the instrument, the operators found liquid acrylic acid in the pipe between the valve and the flange. The gasket was found intact. The upper flange contained crystallised acrylic acid. After cleaning of the flange surface, a new gasket was applied on the flange. Then the instrument was installed and bolts were fastened. The manual valve was opened and it was observed that the flange did not leak for 5-10 minutes.  Temporary thermal insulation was put in place. Later the insulation was improved with aluminium covers.Two days later, an acrylic acid smell was observed by an operator during a patrol tour. He saw part of the installation covered with crystallised acrylic acid and observed fluid acrylic acid rain coming down from the installation. The leak is stopped by stopping a pump. A 1cm gap between the flanges was discovered. Investigation showed that after torqueing the flange and insulating the instrument and pipe, the product crystals formed on the flange surface had melted, allowing a small leak to start. Vibrations on the pipe, especially those caused when starting a pump nearby, loosened the bolts and nuts so that finally a flange gap of about 1 cm was created with a big leakage as a consequence.During the leakage between 25 to 30 tonnes of acrylic acid was spilled.","Acrylic acid vapours from inside the installation crystallise on the flange surface very quickly, even in the time between cleaning the flange surface and closing the flange.After the work the installation was insulated again and after some time the solid acrylic acid melted forming a small leak.Due to vibrations, especially from a nearby pump the bolts were loosened creating a gap of 1 cm and thus a large leak.",- ​smell nuisance (acrylic acid)- local contamination of installation,Access to the installation was prohibited without personnel protective equipment.The solidified acrylic acid was dissolved by applying water on it.,"The accident occurred in a period of freezing ambient temperature, so well below the freezing point of acrylic acid.Under such circumstances it is impossible to make a leak tight flange connection if liquid acrylic acid (and its vapour) is in the installation.The vapour crystallizes so quickly on the exposed surfaces that a flange connection can't be made without a film of solid acrylic acid on the flange surface. The film between the flanges melts slowly when heated up after re-insulating the flange from the heat of the installation and then starts to leak.Once bolts are loosened the are loosened further by vibrations, making leaks worse.

584,676,Major Accident,Wood treatment and furniture,Wood-dust-explosion in a plant for the production of wooden chipboards,1997-01-06 00:00:00,1997-01-06 00:00:00,"A wood-dust-explosion occurred in a plant for the production of wooden chipboards during the loading operation of a combustion installation, 4 persons were injured. The explosion occurred on the bottom-side (under-side) of the drag-chain conveyor. The returning drag-chains are coated and form with the bottom of the trough an essentially closed room (space). The conveyor has the function to transport fuel, mainly&nbsp; in the form of chips and pieces of wood, from a bulk pit (hole) to the combustion chamber. The fuel is fed, in correspondence of the supply (transfer) point, in the combustion chamber through a lock (gate). The actual cause of the explosion (accident root cause) could not yet be identified. Probably the explosion was ignited through a flame-transmission from the furnace. In principle it is possible that an ignition source has penetrated in the drag-chain conveyor from the bulk pit or the combustion chamber. The possibility that the ignition source originated from the bulk pit can be excluded, considering the fact that the fuel was frozen due to the low external temperatures, and that it is very unlikely that the frozen fuel ignites (catches fire). The ignition source could have been transmitted from the furnace, even if the fuel is fed through a lock. Due to the rough (harsh) operation conditions it is plausible that the lock-flaps did not close tight. It is also plausible that the explosion occurred in the combustion chamber or that the under-pressure control was disturbed.Four persons doing repair works on a filter in the direct vicinity of (immediately near) the drag-chain-conveyor were injured by the explosion. Two persons could be sent home from hospital after ambulant treatment, whereas the two other persons had to be hospitalised for a longer period due to the burns on their faces.The paneling of the drag-chain-conveyor was ripped off by the explosion.Wood dust-explosion (deflagration of wood-dust) in a combustion installation",not yet clear,damage to persons 4 (persons injured); material damage approximately 1000 ECU (material loss and loss of production).Affected Area: Affected Area: installation,not indicated,"To avoid recurrence of such accidents, two steam nozzles (vents), acting as spark blocks, were installed in the fuel lock of the combustion chamber, the nozzles are intended to assure that no sparks can reach the drag-chain conveyor.

585,39,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Worker suffered deadly burns after a bucket with flammable solvent he carried ignited,2004-12-03 00:00:00,2004-12-03 00:00:00,"At the end of every week the coating pan of the coating tower was to be cleaned. Normally this is done using scraping knives. However, it is easier to clean the pan if the pan is soaked in solvent for some time. For this purpose, methylethylketon (MEK) can be tapped into safety cans. A second solvent, tetrahydrofurane (THF), was available on site and is more effective in soaking the pan than MEK. The operators knew this and got the THF from the first floor of the coating tower using a bucket (no safety cans were available here since this was not the normal operation).
In the accident, the victim also filled a bucket with THF on the first floor, but this time the liquid ignited (most likely from an electrostatic discharge). Knowing that the coating tower was a classified area, the victim has tried to carry the burning bucket outside. For that he had to go down the stairs. In the staircase, he fell and dropped the bucket. This had two effects: burning liquid was splashed onto his clothes and there was a larger burning surface, resulting in a large fire, surrounding the victim.
He was able to get out of the staircase and ran (with his clothes burning) towards a colleague in a nearby room. This colleague was able to put out the fire on his clothes. However, the burns were so severe that the victim died one day later.

587,499,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Loss of dilute sulphuric acid form a ruptured pipe in a manufacture of titanium oxide plant,2002-08-05 00:00:00,2002-08-11 00:00:00,"Discharge of acid substances from an industrial process following the failure of a transfer pipe between the site and the discharge point.The accident can be classified in the OECD framework (off-site transfer pipe). However, as the pipe belongs to a Low Threshold Seveso site, it was notified under MARS as an ""other event"".The event was classified level 3 of the scale, as published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso directive (cost of repairs in excess of 5.8 Meuros).The accident: On 7 August 2002 at 12.01 a.m., the pipe monitoring system (line balance) detected a leak of 100 m3/h (out of a nominal flow of 500 m3/h) of secondary water (dilute sulphuric acid: concentration less than or equal to 15 g/l of sulphate), at a pressure of 5 bars. An inspection was made by the operator on the ground and in all ducts over the whole route of the pipe in order to identify the leak. Assessed at about 20 m3, the leak was due to fissuring on 40 cm of a pipe within the boundaries of the Le Havre plant. After the faulty section had been replaced, the whole of the pipe was tested again and the facility returned to operation. Four days later, on Sunday 11 August 2002 at 8.05 p.m. a new leak occurred which the monitoring system at once detected. The nominal flow was then 440 m3/h (dilute sulphuric acid), at a pressure of 3.9 bars (these conditions are however lower than the maximum running conditions and lower still than the test conditions). The leak was located outside the Le Havre plant, in an underground part of the pipeline, close to where it runs under a railway line behind the LPG storage and filling centre. The leak was assessed at between 100 and 200 m3.  In total, between 5 August and 11 August 2002, eight defects were found, six of them on the first two kilometres of pipe. Two defects occurred during operation, under similar conditions, near to bends and at changes of direction, yet this pipeline had only run a few dozen hours under operating conditions where the pressure had never exceeded 5 bars in a dilute sulphuric acid environment (concentration less than 15g/l) and at a temperature of under 35°C (temperature allowed for LFG pipes 50°C).  As from 11 August 2002, the pipe was shut down for generic failure. Experts were appointed by both the owner and the operator in order to determine the reasons for the failure of the pipe. In November 2002 and January 2003, leak detection tests using a mixture of nitrogen + helium revealed two further leaks.","All of the defects found on the pipe were similar in terms of:- The main direction of fissuring: lengthways in the bottom part of the pipe (lower part of the curve),- Location: close to a singular zone, namely change of gradient or angle (45°, 30°, 22°, 11° bends or high point).It was clearly demonstrated that the damage to the pipe was due to a mechanism of stress corrosion in an acid environment. Stress corrosion is a fissuring mechanism that requires a combination of the following three factors:- A stress (or permanent distortion),- A material sensitive to the phenomenon,- A corrosive environment.All of the basic data for the pipeline specification was analysed by experts appointed subsequent to the failures in the pipe. The investigation produced several findings:- Soil / structure interaction As regards the soil, the specification for the pipe required minimum compacting for the bed and sides. Now soil tests made around the pipeline showed compacting values lower than those specified. The pipe thus became more oval in places than the maximum acceptable value.- Hydraulic specification In order to protect the pipeline both from excess pressure (water hammer on start-up) and from negative pressure (pumping stop / start stage), a 20 m3 water hammer protection chamber was installed at the start of the line. To be effective, it was specified that the chamber should be pre-pressurised at 0.5 bar; now on testing following the various incidents, it was found that the chamber had been ore-pressurised at 1.7 bar. The whole of the pipeline thus suffered a more violent pressure drop when pumping stopped (the greatest negative pressure having occurred in the first two kilometres). Similarly, the potential existence of air at high points, because of the absence of vents at the highest points, could have had the same hydraulic consequences, from both excess pressure and negative pressure. - Life of composite pipelines The design curve for the pipeline as regards the risk from stress corrosion supplemented with some experimental values in the field of substantial distortion shows that the burst-time for composite pipelines is a few dozen hours for substantial distortions.The failures occurred near to or at high points and close to a change of direction, which confirms the role of hydraulic transitions. Some failures occurred in a zone where it is difficult to have correct soil compacting (pipeline near to the water table and concrete bore holes). Lastly, most of the failures (6 out of 8) occurred in the first two kilometres, which is the area where hydraulic forces are highest.&nbsp;","All soil polluted by the various leaks was treated with sodium carbonate and used as backfill for trenches. Soil investigations undertaken after each of these incidents did not reveal any significant effect on soil or facilities located within the potential impact perimeter of the leaks.
","Problems encountered by the plant in operating its new pipe turned out to be far more serious than anticipated and the operator was not anticipating starting the pipe up again before September 2003.As the 13 August 2002 emergency measure order expired on 13 September 2002, the operator asked for it to be extended to December 2002. A further emergency measure order proposed by the DRIRE was signed by the Prefect on 17 September 2002:- It took into account the actual characteristics of the effluent, which resulted in an increase in the flow discharged (maximum average flow over 24 h equal to 14,760 m3/d) and the distance at which the pH is over 5.5 being extended from 50 m to 80 m;- It provided for an investigation into the installation of a new emergency, temporary outfall to discharge into Seine Bay, so as to enable investigations to continue on the pipe between the Le Havre site and Hode without affecting progress on work to redevelop the port.Up to 31 December 2002, the operator thus discharged its effluent into the Seine, via the old outfall (used before the pipe between the Le Havre site and Hode came into operation) partly isolating it from the work to extend the port of the Le Havre. As the new pipe between the Le Havre plant and the Hode neutralisation unit could not be operated again before the end of the 3rd quarter 2003, as an intermediate solution the operator confirmed the building of the new outfall. Various procedures under the regulations lead to temporary approval of:- Firstly the discharge of effluent into the Seine estuary,- Secondly the alteration of the point of discharge into Seine Bay.The operator thus had to stop discharging into Seine Bay up to 2 January 2004 and bring the pipe between the Le Havre plant and the Hode neutralisation unit back into operation.Furthermore, as there had been a number of incidents at the site in a few months, the 21 October 2002 Prefect's emergency measures order specified an audit of its Health, Safety and Environment management system in order to ensure that it was adequate and functioning correctly.Lastly, the Prefect signed an order on 12 December 2002 requiring a review of all hazard surveys relative to the Le Havre site. This was because the last hazard surveys undertaken were specific to certain units and were more than five years old. In view of the various incidents that had occurred at the site, it appeared necessary to take stock of all hazards at the site and not just at some units.Technically speaking, the operator has replaced all leaking pipes. On 22 July 2003, the pipe successfully underwent a further test with water at a pressure of 15 bars maintained for 2 hours. Tests with acidic water were conducted from early August 2003, two other pipes at high points were damaged and have been repaired. In November 2003, the plant was stopped as the acid production unit was being serviced. New trials are scheduled for when acid effluent is available again.Finally, an additional order by the Prefect was made on 8 March 2004. It requires a new transport pipe to be brought into operation before 30 June 2006. It will follow the route of the old pipe and will be made or high density poly-ethylene (HDPE), not LFG.","The lessons to be learned from this series of incidents cover both the technical domain and also the organisational aspect.TechnicallyAlthough the pipes and their assembly complied with the provisions in the regulations as required by the order, which was conformed on 16 July 2002 by a satisfactory resistance test, that the installation of the pipe and pressure control systems were not, however, in accordance with good custom and practice (non-compliance with the specification as regards installing, incorrect sizing of the buffer chamber and under-estimate of the number of vents).On the evidence, the management of project, which involved various parties (internal and external engineering departments, the fabricator of the pipe, civil engineering contractors appointed and their subcontractors, operator), was the cause of several of the faults, in particular, in the systematic pre-checking of calculations, the installation conditions for the pipe and compliance with various rules for pressurising the facility.Financial aspectsThe series of incidents resulted in substantial costs for the operator (business interruption, repairing leaks, changes to the discharge point into Seine Bay, investigations after incidents, repairing the pipe,#). For example, shortening the old outfall and remaking a diffuser cost&nbsp; 329,300 # excluding VAT, and setting up the new discharge point has been estimated at 5,500,000 #. For economic reasons, this work had to be done as temporary replacement of the new pipe between the Le Havre plant and Hode and would never have been undertaken if the new pipe had been operational from the 3rd quarter 2002.Organisational aspectsThe operator's HSE management system required improvements."

During the night shift from 24 to 25 August 2011, a fresh water inlet hose became disconnected from a hose connection during a trial operation of the plant*. The fresh water escaped unnoticed (estimated flow rate 0.5 l/s) and flooded the process bath. The water-diluted mixture from the process bath first ran into the passivation unit’s collecting basin situated directly beneath the bath and was able to flow out from there unnoticed over an edge. Finally, the mixture escaped into the open via a hall door. *In order to produce high-quality, uniform layers, the temperature in the bath has to be kept constant. Because of this the process bath is cooled. This is done using a titanium cooling coil which is fitted inside the bath and connected to a fresh water supply (in the present case, the municipal mains) via hose connections (inlet and outlet). The heated cooling water is returned to the plant for rinsing purposes. The stop-cock for the fresh water supply is located on the process bath’s operating platform and was opened manually at the beginning of the trial operation.
Staff discovered the damage at around 00:45 in the course of a patrol. The fresh water supply was immediately turned off manually. The person in charge, the internal environmental protection officer, the fire brigade, the waste water treatment plant and the police were notified.

594,840,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Accident in a process plant for trichloro-trifluoroethane production of an organic chemical industry,1992-02-01 18:00:00,1992-02-01 00:00:00,The plant was producing trichloro-trifluoroethane (Arcton 113) by reacting carbon tetrachloride with chlorine and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride in presence of a catalyst. Crude gases leaving the reaction section undergo a series of stripping and separation processes to separate the trichloro-trifluoroethane from by-products and unreacted raw materials. The failed pipe was in this downstream part of the plant. The failure occurred 2 hours after the plant start-up.The chronology of the accident was as follows:18:05: the leak was detected by a plant operator and the plant shut-down was initiated;18:10: the chlorine stripper was isolated from the reactor;18:30: the pipe was isolated at the cooler inlet and the fire brigade was called;18:35: water sprays were set up downwind the leak;18:45: an off-site chlorine concentration of 0.5-1.0 ppm was detected;18:50: the major off-site emergency plan was activated;19:30: the emission rate was reduced to half and the source leak was identified;20:30: the works to clamp the hole in the pipe was initiated;21:35: the leak was sealed;21:45: the emergency services were stand down.,"INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The failure of the 2"" monel pipe connecting the chlorine stripper boiler and the phase separator cooler of the chlorine stripping section allowed the release of liquid/vapour mixture under pressure. The released liquid/vapour mixture was toxic, containing hydrogen fluoride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride and trichloro-trifluoroethane.
CAUSES:
The 2"" monel pipe failed due to internal corrosion. The rate of corrosion was about 3 times that expected but the researches and the trials that have been made have not identified the causes of this behaviour. However, underlying causes should have been inadequate process analysis, pipe design and testing procedures.","MATERIAL LOSS:Extensive damage to the instrumentation on the plant due to the corrosive characteristics of the released gases.EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 6 (from the Original Report it is not fully clear if 5 or 6 people were injured) people suffered injuries: 2 of them suffered minor gassing, 3 minor hydrogen fluoride burns and 1 banged knee. All were treated at the site medical center. Outside the establishment about 2,500 people, up to 1.5 km from the source of the leak, were confined to their homes for about 2 hours.1 lady who drove through the cloud with a car was reported to the local hospital with minor eyes irritation. 1 pregnant lady was reported to the the hospital because of concern for the baby but no effects were found.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:About 2,500 people off-site, up to 1.5 km from the source of the leak, were confined to their homes for about 2 hours.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA:The extent of the effects is shown on a map attached to the Original Report. In this map, the points were the chlorine measurements had been carried out are highlighted in yellow.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The on-site major emergency plan was activated and the plant was shut-down using control systems. The leak section was isolated and the failed pipe was fitted with a temporary patch. The internal emergency teams were activated and water sprays used to knock down vapours and to dilute the spillage (washed to effluent treatment plant). About thirty appliances were deployed during the accident.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The off-site major emergency plan was activated but little action was required as no real off-site effects. Gas detection was carried out in a North East direction from the release point. Approximately 2,500 people were advised to stay in their homes.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).Official action taken - other official action: When the Original Report was prepared, a Prohibition Notice served to prevent the operation of the plant until the investigations have not been completed and any remedial measures (that the investigations showed to be necessary) have fully implemented. In any case, the plant may not operate again because, due to the Montreal Protocol about the ChloroFluoroCarbons, it has to be closed soon.","When the Original Report was prepared, a Prohibition Notice served to prevent the operation of the plant until the investigations have not been completed and any remedial measures (that the investigations showed to be necessary) have fully implemented.

Furthermore, the compressed air added via the nozzle ring installed at the base of the tank was increased to over 3&nbsp;m3/h.
These measures guaranteed specific maximum temperatures throughout the entire incident.In the lower and middle parts of the tank, the acrylamide solution remained in a liquid state, while in the upper part, for the most part a solid polymer developed.
In the following weeks, the tank was drained.Having removed approximately 54&nbsp;t, a circular opening (600&nbsp;mm in diameter) had to be cut in the wall of the tank, above the level of the liquid, in order to continue pumping out the contents of the tank.Once the tank was empty, the inside of the tank and the pipes linked to the tank were cleaned by a specialist firm.Following laboratory testing, the polymer that had developed was transferred to a waste disposal facility and disposed of.An inspection of the inside of the tank by the operator found absolutely no abnormalities.The cut-out circular opening was welded, smoothed and passivated by a specialist firm.On 9&nbsp;September&nbsp;2015, an extraordinary inspection was carried out by an expert. No defects whatsoever were found, and there were no concerns regarding continued use.
Safety function:Addition of copper sulphate solution (stabilising agent) to the storage tank.","During dismantling / inspection of the pump by a specialist company, polymerisate was detected in the gap area of the magnetic pot.This polymer could have had an initiating effect for a subsequent tank polymerisation and have its cause in an inadequate liquid filling of this pump region. This, in turn, may have been created in advance by a gas-pulling inlet vortex to the pump during emptying with a low filling level of the tank.In the future, such a phenomenon is avoided by raising the minimum levels in the storage tanks.",The on-site fire service was able to prevent a serious hazard.,"Addition of a stabilising agent (copper sulphate solution) to the storage tank before the temperature reached 30&nbsp;°C (activation of the protective system).

596,593,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire of methanol originated by the explosion of an empty tank that destroy other two,1987-05-15 08:00:00,1987-05-15 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
Taking also into account witnesses who heard a first big explosion and a few seconds later two other more suffocated explosions, it was deduced that most likely the empty tank No 43 exploded first causing the explosions of tanks No 44 and 45. The explosions of tanks No 44 and 45 were followed by the fire of the contained methanol. Tank No 42 was also partially damaged because of the explosion of the adjacent No 43: it was still emitting hexane vapours during the inspection. Probably the explosion was caused by the ignition of a mixture of residual methanol vapours with air formed during the degassing operations of tank No 43 (it was degassed with air in order to recover nonane). When the explosion occurred, five workers were working on degassing operations: after the accident, three dead bodies had been recovered and another worker was missed (his lifeless body was found a few days later). On the basis of the positions in which their bodies were found, they were presumably on top of the tank No 43, near to an open man-hole. The last worker, heavily injured, had been found in the pump-room and was hospitalized. According to Carmagnani's officials the tank's cleaning was considered a routine operation: depending on the substances to remove, water or air were used for cleaning purposes. In case of purging with water, washing water gathered by a draining system was conveyed to a waste-water treatment plant. In case that two incompatible substances had to be loaded subsequently into the same tank, purging with air was used (air was pumped in the vessel through a man-hole and was discharged from other openings). This situation occurred for tank No 43 because methanol residues were considered incompatible with nonane that had to be stored. All purging operations were normally carried out without neither nitrogen protection nor by monitoring the surrounding environment for the presence of flammable gases. No fixed explosimeter or smoke detectors were installed but the operators could make use of portable explosimeters and personal protection devices (breathing apparatuses, filters, masks). The first aid room was equipped with stretches and medical supplies and fire extinguishers were placed as laid down under the Fire Brigade's Regulations.
","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The ignition of an explosive methanol vapours/air mixture occurred inside an empty tank likely during degassing operations (the tank was degassed with air in order to recover nonane).

CAUSES:
The ignition of an explosive methanol vapours/air occurred inside an empty tank likely during degassing operations (the tank was degassed with air in order to recover nonane because it was supposed to be incompatible with methanol). The operation was carried out without neither nitrogen protection nor by monitoring the presence of flammable gases. No fixed explosimeter or smoke detectors were installed but the operators could make use of portable explosimeters and personal protection devices (breathing apparatuses, filters, masks).
","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:4 people were killed and 1 injured by the explosion in tank No 43. All of them were working in the coastal depot. Outside the installation were exposed: the students and the personnel
of the school 20 metres far from the factory fence and 40 metres from
tank No 43; people which were travelling on Milano-Ventimiglia rail-way
20 metres far from tank No 43; people living in the nearby buildings.
None of them was injured by the accident.MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion and the following fire caused the destruction of: storage tanks, pipelines, window panes, doors and factory fence.Outside the installation the explosion caused the breakage of the windows and a slight deformation of the doors of the nearby buildings. No data are available about the cost of the damages.ECOLOGICAL HARM:Some trees burned only in the close area around the installation. It is not fully clear if trees were natural or planted.

This manual operation, which is carried out with three operators, is a finishing stage that consists in removing the blocks of propellant that remain attached to the dies used in propellant manufacture.
","Several investigations have been carried out in order to determine the cause of the ignition, as well as the stage of operations in question. The propellant is sensitive to electrostatic charges, shocks and friction. No anomalies were detected during the casting that preceded the demoulding operation.","The three members of staff present in the facility were severely burned. One of them died the following morning of his injuries. The facility in question was seriously damaged and rendered unusable - the light-weight roof was damaged, building blocks collapsed, the main door was blown out, structural steel components and interior equipment were deformed. However, no damage was identified beyond the building itself.","Alerted by the cries of the victims and by several alarms that had been set off from within the facility, the site rescue service arrived immediately and called for assistance from external emergency services.
The victims were given first aid and were then transferred to the nearest hospital. The fire was quickly brought under control by the fire fighters. The factory's manufacturing of pyrotechnic substances was stopped, and such activities did not resume until the cause of the accident had been determined.
","An incident occurred involving another type of propellant in another building in February 2006. This led to improvements in safety as well as the partial automation of operations. In generalising the feedback, these improvements were applied in a preventive manner to workplaces possessing similar risks, such as that involved in the accident, in order to minimise operators' exposure to the risk of direct contact with pyrotechnic substances. The handling operation that was underway at the moment of the accident was, however, a manual operation."
598,41,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Leak of crude oil in a large storage terminal with many tanks,2005-10-25 18:15:00,2005-10-28 00:00:00,"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SituationThe storage terminal contains 7 storage tanks in one large bund. The bund is made of earth. The terminal is situated at some distance from the refinery it is connected with.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 large crude oil tanks of which 3 are situated in a row and a fourth crude oil tank is situated before the second tank. These storage tanks are identified as D1, D2, D3 and D4;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 smaller slop oil tanks, D10 and D11;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a very small crude oil tank D26.The crude oil tanks D1, D2, D3 and D4 have a capacity of 40 000 m3 and the slop oil tanks D10 and D11 have a capacity of 24 000 m3.The crude oil is delivered by pipeline and is pumped by pipeline to the Refinery.On September 12th, 2005 a minor incident occurred at the storage tank D3. During this incident an amount of 35 m3 crude oil leaked from the bottom of the tank. The exact cause of this incident is not yet known. At the moment the major accident occurred with tank D2 cleaning operations for storage tank D3 were just started in order to inspect storage tank D3 and to determine the causes of the incident of September 12th.At the moment the major accident happened the slop oil tank D10 was full, the slop oil tank D11 was empty, the crude oil tank D4 was partially full, the crude oil tank D2 was for 75% full en the tanks D1, D3 en D26 were empty and in revision.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chronological description of the accident and the interventionOn October 25, 2005 around 18.15h a major leak at tank D2 was detected. Storage tank D2 contained at that moment almost 33 000 m3 crude oil. Information from the DCS-system situated in the off-sites control room of the refinery indicates that the full inventory of storage tank D2 was released within 10 minutes. Because the contents of the storage tank was released in such a short time, an enormous wave appeared. Due to the amount of crude that was released, the bund was filled ( 40 000 m2 large) with crude up to&nbsp; a height of 1 m. Due to the effect of the crude wave, a small amount of 3 m3 of crude was ejected out of the bund into a nearby creek.After the release the storage tank was leaning forward. It also seamed that the storage tank was sledded of his foundation, although it is not clear if this was a cause or rather a consequence of the incident. Initially the fire brigade started to cover the bund with fire fighting foam to avoid ignition of the crude oil and to reduce the smell. Directly a large amount of fire fighting foam was donated by the Refinery, other (petro)chemical companies and the fire brigade to cover the very large bund area with foam.&nbsp; Due to the very strong wind that evening and the use of different types of fire fighting foam they did not succeeded to cover the whole bund with foam. Especially the inner part of the large bund (where al the piping and valves are situated) stayed even after several hours uncovered. On the other hand the strong wind had the advantage that no explosive atmosphere was formed above the spill.The contents of the slop oil tank D10 and the crude oil tank D4 was immediatly pumped to storage tanks situated at the refinery itself. The contents of the bund is firstly pumped to the slop oil tank D11. In order to fill the slop oil tank D10 and de crude oil tank D4 with the product in the bund, some manual valves had to be handled. Because of the presence of piping, valves and walking platforms in the bund, is was not possible to reach the valves by boat. Therefore two operators (fully protected with chemical overalls and breathing apparatus) have walked through the crude and manipulated the valves.During the next two days the mixture of crude oil, fire fighting foam and water was pumped to the storage tanks D10 and D4. This was done at a velocity of 900 m3 an hour. Afterwards a part of this mixture was send to storage tanks at the refinery. In the afternoon of October 27th , 2005 the bund was mostly empty, except of some smaller pools of crude oil. These pools were removed by vacuum cleaning trucks.On October 28th, 2005 the intervention was finished and the cleaning up of the terminal could start. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommentsThe storage tank D2 was built in 1970. At that moment the storage terminal belonged to XX. It was sold in 1990 to the Refinery. At that moment all the tanks were inspected and repaired if necessary. This was also the case for storage tank D2. The inspection before the tank D2 was used again was done in 1991. From 1994 until now each 3 years an external inspection was performed. These inspections showed almost no remarks. Next year a total revision of the storage tank was planned. Every three years setting measurements of the storage tanks were carried out. The last measurements were done in 2004. These measurements showed no anomalies.At this moment the cause of this major accident is not yet know. There are some indications that a subsidence (movement of the soil) could have caused this accident, because one month before this accident the crude oil tank D3 also had a leak. More investigation on both tanks is necessary to know if both accidents are related with each other.Two days after the accident, the bund was nearly empty. At that moment it was clearly visible that a part of the foundation of storage tank D2 had disappeared. Parts of the foundation were found in the bund over a distance of 20 to 30 m. An important concern after the accident is the stability of all storage tanks at the storage terminal at the left bank. For the moment each day setting measurements are performed. To reduce the risk of another release, most part of the contents of the storage tanks D4, D10 and D11 are pumped to the refinery where it was shipped to Rotterdam. Afterwards these tanks were partially filled with water in order to let the roof float.For the moment the terminal only contains sludge. This sludge is present in the storage tanks D4, D10, D11 and D2.After the accident the company organized already 8 inspections with the authorities in order to discuss al measures they are taking concerning safety and environment. Also a public hearing for the neighbourhood was organized.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean-up operationsThe Refinery has set up a project group in order to make the terminal safe and start the cleaning of the terminal.In order to reduce the smell in the neighbourhood. The bund area is covered with sand, except the zone in front of the storage tank D2. Because the tank is leaning forward, it was not safe to enter the bund and in that area a lot of sludge was still present. This sludge containing a lot of sand is very viscous and has an average depth of 1 m.From November 6th, 2005 the storage tank D2 is stabilized by 4 mayor cranes. These cranes that can support the total mass of the storage tank are placed on a service way just outside the bund.After the stabilisation of the storage tank D2, two manholes of the storage tank were opened. Measurements indicated that the atmosphere in the storage tank was not explosive. They also saw that the floating roof had properly landed on his supports (legs). Nevertheless the company does not want operators to enter the storage tank to remove the sludge. For that reason they have ordered a robot to suck the sludge out of the storage tank.In the next week a profound investigation of the soil will start. Firstly drillings until a depth of 2 to 3 m will be performed to measure the soil contamination. Afterwards drilling until a depth of 25 to 30 m will be performed to measure the stability of the soil at the terminal and in the surroundings.","A circumferential fissure in the bottom plate has been observed after cleaning.
This fissure has a length of about 10 m and is situated at about 2 m from the tank wall.

Samples of the bottom plate have been taken for further investigation.","Soil contamination.
Smell complaints in a large area.","Covering spill with foam
clean up of spill","6.1. Detection of the problemJust as for each process equipment with risks for major accidents, the phenomena which can lead to a degradation of the containment, in this case the storage tank, should be identified and analysed.This accident indicates the possible risks as a consequence of the presence of non mixable phases which can settle out. An investigation of the possible presence of such phases should form a part of the identification of possible corrosive phenomena. If necessary chemical analyses should be performed to determine the corrosive behaviour of these phases (chemical composition, pH,#).This incident further shows that in the bottom of storage tanks gutters can be formed. In those gutters corrosive products can accumulate, what can result in local, uniform corrosion. In the case water and/or other corrosive products can induce corrosion of the tank bottom, it should be investigated if there is also a problem of gutter forming in the bottom.Gutter forming in the bottom of storage tanks is induced by a combination of the size of the storage tank, the local compressibility of the foundation and a relative elastic underground. The gutters are not always visible by the eye. They can be mapped by performing a topographic investigation. The topographic maps are achieved by a surveyor who measures the bottom of the storage tank with a laser.The local uniform corrosion which is a consequence of the gutter forming is not easily detected. The local reduction of the thickness of the bottom plate can be overlooked if ultrasonic thickness measurements are only performed on a cross banded pattern. If the risk of local corrosion due to gutter forming in the bottom exists, suitable techniques should be used to investigate the bottom plates. These techniques are described below.6.2. Possible solutionsIf local, uniform corrosion induced by gutter forming is a problem, the company should take suitable measures to avoid a loss of containment as a consequence of the corrosion. In the next paragraph some different possible measures are listed according to the place they take in the prevention hierarchy. In function of the specific situation it can be necessary to take multiple measures, if necessary completed with additional measures which are not described here.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoiding or limiting the presence of corrosive products that can settle out.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid that products settle out (mixing the different phases)Mixing of the products in the storage tank can avoid or limit that insoluble phases settle out. To achieve good results the effectiveness of the mixing is important.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removing of settled out productsIt has to be assured by a procedure that settled out products are periodically removed. But note that the draining of settled out products does not guarantee that settlements are removed out of gutters in the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoiding the formation of gutters in the bottomExisting storage tanks can be lifted up and the foundation underneath can be restored. In this case it must be kept in mind that by performing a hydrostatic test it is possible that new settlements can take place. For existing tanks there is also the possibility to analyse the foundation and the underground under the storage tanks in order to gather enough information to perform calculations. These calculations can indicate if the risk of gutter forming exists or not. For new storage tanks a detailed calculations of the foundations can be performed during the design phase to reduce the risk of gutter formation.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LiningA lining is applied on the tank bottom and the first shell course. A lining which is well attached will largely reduce the corrosion velocity. A badly adjusted lining will still reduce the uniform corrosion but will promote pitting corrosion underneath the lining. A good attachment of a lining depends on a lot of parameters such as moisture, temperature, kind of lining, not stepping on a not fully hardened layer,#.&nbsp; To achieve guarantee about the thickness of the lining and the attachment of the lining it is necessary to perform measurements on the thickness of the different layers, to perform a conductivity test and to perform a non porosity test. The code API 652 ""Linings of aboveground petroleum storage tank bottoms"" describes the advantages and disadvantages of different kind of linings.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning of internal inspections based on the corrosion velocityThe intervals between internal inspections have to be defined based on the estimated corrosion velocity. This is a general principle that can be found in de API 653 standard ""Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration and Reconstruction"". Normally the corrosion velocity of the bottom plates is the most important one. In the case of major local corrosion, it will be this higher, local corrosion velocity which is determinative for the inspection interval.The internal corrosion velocity can be determined by analysing the settled out products. Based on graphics which indicate the overall corrosion velocity of the construction material as a function of the corrosive character of these residues (e.g. pH-measurement), the corrosion velocity can be estimated. Based on the corrosion velocity it can be determined how long the storage tank can be safely used before a next internal inspection is necessary. API 653 describes what minimum plate thicknesses have to be measured to use a storage tank safely. If it is expected that large differences can occur in the chemical composition and the properties of the residues, these analyses and the calculation of the inspection interval must be periodically repeated. The analysis of the bottom products can be used to trace other corrosion phenomena (e.g. bacteriological corrosion).&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adapted internal inspection techniquesInternal inspections in which case ultrasonic thickness measurements are only performed in a cross banded pattern (just to achieve a general impression of the thickness of the bottom of the storage tank) are not sufficient to trace local, uniform corrosion.In order to achieve an entire image of all changes in the thickness of the bottom of a storage tank the bottom must be totally scanned. Floor scans are very useful to measure sudden volume changes in the floor (e.g. pitting corrosion). They can however also be used to trace gradual changes in the thickness of the bottom plates. To guarantee that a floor scan generates accurate information on the state of the entire bottom of the storage tank, certain conditions have to be satisfied.It must be checked if the presence of a lining has an influence on the results of the floor scan.Before the inspection is must be clearly discussed with the performers in which state the storage tank must be presented to achieve good measurements. In some cases the entire bottom of the storage tank must be sand blasted before measurements can be performed. In this case it is necessary to discuss the criteria for the sand blasting in advance. It is also favourable that the contractor who will perform the floor scan inspects the cleaning conditions of the bottom plates.The signal that is generated by the floor scanning apparatus can suffer from drift. This phenomenon is not necessarily a problem if the floor scanning is used to detect pitting corrosion. The moment pitting corrosion is detected, the signal changes so much that even with some drift on the signal, the pitting corrosion is detected. The drift on the electric signal has however a much larger impact when floor scanning is used to detect gradual changes in the bottom floor. To solve this problem it is useful to perform a few ultrasonic thickness measurements on each bottom plate. The signal from the floor scanning apparatus can be gauged for each bottom plate in order to achieve accurate measurements on gradual changes in the bottom thickness.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional external inspection techniquesIn addition to the above described internal inspections, intermediate external inspections can be performed in order to gather additional information on the corrosion status of the storage tanks. These inspection techniques, which can be applied when the storage tanks are in duty, are especially useful when there is large uncertainty on the corrosion phenomena and/or on the corrosion velocity.A first technique uses acoustic emission measurements. Microphones are placed on the shell of the storage tank to receive sound waves coming out of the tank. Each sound wave is stored and the source of the noise is calculated by software. The sounds that can be associated with a general corrosion activity have a very high frequency. The data are processed in order to map the places where corrosion activity is found and to determine the density of the corrosion activity. The technique makes it also possible to determine different grades of corrosion activity, going from grade A (very small) to grade E(high corrosion activity). As a function of the established corrosion activity it can be decided to perform immediately an internal inspection on the storage tank (in case of grade E), to reschedule the next internal inspection to an earlier date or to repeat the acoustic emission measurements after a certain period.The acoustic emission technique also allows to detect leaks. These leaks are detected at other frequencies than the frequencies at which the general corrosion activity is detected. This technique makes it possible to detect small perforations in the tank bottom.Another technique to achieve an indication of certain corrosion phenomena is ""long range ultrasonics"". This technique admits to achieve a qualitative image of the status of the annular bottom plates (not from the entire tank bottom) by using guided waves.These external inspection techniques do not gather (quantitative) information about the corrosion velocity and can't be used to enlarge the inspection interval that is based on the corrosion velocity.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applying leak detection techniquesSeveral techniques can be applied to detect a leak in the bottom of a storage tank while the storage tank is in duty.A possible leak detection technique exists of cables placed in the underground at fixed distances. The conductivity of these cables changes if a product is detected in the underground.Larger leaks can be detected by looking for abnormal deviations in the fluid level in the storage tank. If a continuous level measurement is installed on the storage tank, it is possible to install an extra alarm in the control program. The alarm is generated when the fluid level decreases when there are no pumping activities out of the storage tank. "

The doors of the filling station building were still open, because the tightness control, which according to the standard procedure must be carried out with chlorine gas originating from the storage tank, had not yet been performed.Cause: Because of the incorrect operation, the liquid chlorine valve was erroneously activated too early. The resulting pressure surge in the filling pipeline (the connecting valve between the filling pipeline and the storage tank was still shut), caused the failure of the gasket on the slip-on connecting flange between the tank wagon and the filling pipeline, which led to the liquid chlorine spill.","This incident caused a slight poisoning of 28 persons, of whom 26 were briefly treated as in-patients in a hospital, mainly on account of the necessity of observation.","The personnel of the installation were warned, and the fire brigade, the on-site emergency response service and the authorities were alerted.
About 30-40 staff members of the establishment and employees of other companies were evacuated.

601,561,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Total burn of a factory packing and storing swimming pool and water treatment chemicals and river contamination,2006-09-04 10:15:00,2006-09-05 17:00:00,A factory unit packing and storing swimming pool and water treatment chemicals was totally destroyed by fire with resulting water course contamination and large smoke plume. Almost total loss of chemical inventory well in excess of 5% of the notifiable categories of substances. ,"The fire appears to have started inside the polypropylene tube of the conveyor, probably due to the unintentional mechanical heating (for reasons unknown) of the sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate until it reached thermal decomposition temperature.&nbsp; This may have been significantly lower than the 240oC temperature stated on the safety data sheet, as this is for a &lt;5mg sample and other experimental work has identified 45Kg can decompose at 65oC.&nbsp; Once at decomposition temperature, the chemical, which is an oxidiser, is self-reactive and generates heat.&nbsp; The polypropylene tube would have been heated until it started to deform and melt, mixing plastic with the oxidiser, leading to flaming combustion of the plastic. No forensic evidence has been available to identify with certainty the method of rapid fire spread or cause of fireball as yet.&nbsp; IBCs of hydrochloric acid and other chemicals, which were stored in the yard area immediately adjacent to the factory building, were damaged by the fire and released their contents, which may have been one of the sources of watercourse contamination.","No significant human injury was reported, although there were some reports of minor respiratory irritation.Pollution of the River Colne was classed by the Environment Agency as Category 1 under their Common Incident Classification Scheme. More than 2500 fish were killed over a 6km stretch of the river.&nbsp; It is estimated that the river will take 4 to 7 years to return to pre-incident condition.&nbsp; The factory unit involved in the incident was completely destroyed, but there was only minor material loss to neighbouring premises. Various parked vehicles were damaged and one commercial mini bus was destroyed.Businesses were disrupted at other units on the industrial estate, with access being unavailable for approximately 48 hours.The A40 trunk road was closed for 24 hours due to the smoke plume blowing directly across the road.&nbsp; Access to Andoversford village was also disrupted for 24 hours.","The fire alarm was raised by a manual break glass alarm within the building, linked directly to the Fire Service control centre.&nbsp; The Fire Service responded initially with one tender but then upgraded the incident with more than 15 appliances attending.Approximately 25 people were evacuated from the factory unit immediately, going to the assembly point. Other factory units on the estate were evacuated by the emergency services.The first fire officer attending the scene was given emergency information by the company immediately on arrival on site.The Fire Service put emergency bunds and drain bungs in place as they dealt with the incident.Various outfalls from the drainage system were identified as the incident progressed, and these were blocked by the Environment Agency emergency response team.&nbsp; Chemicals were pumped out of various interception tanks in the drainage system.The Company appointed specialist decontamination specialists to clear the contamination held within the bunded area, and to remove the risk of rain run off adding to the pollution risk.","Mitigation measures to prevent the run off into watercourses appear to have been inadequate. The Company were unaware of the full layout of the drainage system and how their inventory could get into the watercourse.The UN classification of the sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate does not appear to give an accurate description of the reactive nature of the chemical and possible hazardous conditions.&nbsp; Under the classification system it is only because it has oxidising properties that it is not classified as a Division 4.1 self-reactive.&nbsp; If it were classified as a self-reactive it would be limited to transport in packages of 50kg or under, rather than be available as it is in 1000kg FIBC 'big bags.'

602,247,Other Event,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Cloud blast of solvent vapors vented from a  reactor's manway due to a runaway reaction for insufficient cooling,2007-01-31 00:00:00,2007-01-31 00:00:00,"The company manufactured a variety of powder coating and paint additives by polymerizing acrylic monomers in a 1500 gallon reactor.The company had received an order for slightly more of an additive than the normal-sized recipe would produce. Plant managers scaled up the recipe to produce the required larger amount of polymer, and added all of the additional monomer needed into the initial charge to the reactor. This more than doubled the rate of energy release in the reactor, exceeding the cooling capacity of the reactor condenser and causing a runaway reaction. The reactor pressure increased rapidly. Solvent vapors vented from the reactor's manway, forming a flammable cloud inside the building. The vapors found an ignition source, and the resulting explosion killed 1 worker and injured 14. The blast destroyed the facility and damaged off-site structures.The accident has been investigated by the US Chemical Safety Board.","On the day of the accident, a modification in the production recipe was introduced in order to produce approximately 12% more of the final product obtained from a normal batch. The plant superintendent determined the quantities of solvent, monomer and initiator needed for the reaction, which initially was not particularly vigorous. Several minutes later, the senior operator heard a loud hissing and saw vapor venting from the reactor manway, which forced him out of the building. He returned with a respirator and was able to start emergency cooling water flow to the jacket. However, the building exploded 30 seconds after he left.Investigations after the accident revealed that there were several causes that led to the runaway reaction.- The company did not perform hazard identification of their processes. No formal hazard review had been conducted to address what could go wrong during reactor operations. The company had minimal safety information on its polymerization processes, even though this was the core of its manufacturing business. Product formulations were optimized to meet customer specifications. However, reaction characterization and calorimetry were not performed to establish process equipment performance requirements. Indeed, calorimetry experiments performed after the accident proved that the modifications on the recipe generated a heat output that was 2.3 times that of the original recipe, clearly exceeding the heat removal capacity of the condenser and the emergency jacket cooling of the reactor.- When scaling-up new products from the laboratory, previous plant managers had typically estimated initial production batch sizes based on past experience, or with simple trial-and-error systems. Batch quantities were gradually increased until the sight glass in the condensate return line showed that the condenser was too close to flooding, or that another performance limit, like the reactor pressure increase, was being approached. The condenser's cooling capacity was not documented, nor could the cooling load be determined with the available instrumentation. As a result, information essential to the safe operation of the reactor was not available.- Most of the management and operations personnel had been on the job less than one year (in some cases much less) and lacked previous polymer manufacturing experience. Personnel, including site managers, were thus poorly prepared to recognize potentially hazardous changes to product recipes, or to respond to an incipient runaway reaction. Additionally, the company had no chemical or other engineer on staff, and none had been contracted to evaluate the hazards associated with reactive operations at the site.- Based on the accident investigation, it turned out that the employees and managers had little or no understanding of reactive hazards. They had not been trained on, and did not understand, the safety margin of safety needed or available in their polymerization operations. Furthermore, they had little knowledge of the sensitivity of the reactor to changes in product recipes, batch sizes or reaction conditions.- The company relied primarily on a procedural safeguard to prevent loss of reactor control: the batch sheet, which was used as an operating procedure at the site. But additional process safeguards, necessary when coping with the effects of runaway reactions, where totally missing in the reactor set-up. Examples of systems that could have helped to prevent or mitigate the accident are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - high pressure alarm systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - automatic emergency cooling water to the reactor jacket.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - automatic shut-off of initiator feed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - automatic injection of ""short stop"" solution to stop the polymerization reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - automatic venting or dumping of the reactor to a safe location.- After the investigation of the accident, it was found that operators used to open the reactor manway after every batch cycle to clean the reactor. Long standing practice at the facility was to then close the manway and secure it using only 4 of the 18 clamps specified by the manufacturer. The risk posed by this practice had not been recognized because the reactor normally ran at near-atmospheric pressure, for which four clamps were thought to be adequate. Under this situation, it was estimated that the manway began to leak flammable solvent vapors when the reactor pressure reached approximately 23 psig, well below the reactor's maximum allowable working pressure of 75 psig.- The design of the tubular heat exchanger used as a condenser made it difficult to remove for inspection or cleaning. Inspection of this equipment after the accident showed that it was badly fouled, likely reducing the condenser capacity at least 25 per cent. The company had no program to systematically monitor and control water side fouling, and it was found that there was not any inspection&nbsp; or cleaning process to remove the scale, rust and sediment accumulated on the tube during 30 years of service.","1 opeartor was killed and 14 were injuredThe blast destroyed the facility and damaged off-site structures.The fires following the explosion generated thick smoke, and local residents were asked to shelter in-place for several hours. The fires were extinguished the next day.","During this incident, none of the production employees evacuated to a safe location. At the time of the explosion, 6 employees, including the manager and superintendent, gathered outside a doorway on the upper level while a seventh was on the lower level by the lab. The employee on the lower level was killed, while those outside the doorway were injured, two of them seriously.The company was unprepared for an emergency. Specifically:- The Emergency Action Plan did not list events or describe situations that might necessitate a plant evacuation.- Operating procedure did not specify employees' actions in the event of a chemical release or loss of reactor control.- Employees were not trained on the Emergency Action Plan and evacuation drills were not conducted.- The facility was not equipped with an emergency alarm system.The Department of Public Safety responded rapidly and called in mutual aid support from County and nearby municipalities. Employees and Public Safety officers assisted injured employees.The fires following the explosion generated thick smoke, and local residents were asked to shelter in-place for several hours. The fires were extinguished the next day.","This incident provides important lessons for manufacturers with operations involving reactive chemistryIDENTIFY AND CONTROL REACTIVE HAZARDSManufacturers should take a comprehensive approach, and:- Identify and characterize reactive hazards.- Systematically evaluate what can go wrong, including mis-charging of reagents, loss of cooling, instrument malfunction, and other credible failure scenarios.- Implement, document, and maintain adequate safeguards against identified failure scenarios. Multiple, independent safeguards may be needed to reliably ensure the safety of the reactive process.CONTROL CHANGEChemical manufacturers and others with reactive chemistry operations should control changes to batch recipes, including key operating conditions, such as:- The quantities, proportions and sequencing of reactor feeds.- Reaction temperature.- Conditions that could cause initiator or monomer accumulation.- Conditions that could affect the deactivation of monomer inhibitors or stabilizers.MAINTAIN PROCESS EQUIPMENT CAPABILITYManufacturers with reactive chemistry operations should:- Document the perfromance requirements and capabilities of process equipment, such as the reactor condenser at the installation where the accident took place.- Periodically inspect and service process equipment, including the water side of the heat exchangers, to maintain appropriate safety margins.TRAIN PERSONNEL ON HAZARDS PROCEDURESManufacturers should ensure that worker training includes:- The nature of the reactive hazards, including process safety margins.- Operating procedures, including appropriate cautions and warnings, the consequences of deviations, recognition of deviations and abnormal operations, and the appropriate responses to control or mitigate the effects.PREPARE FOR EMERGENCIESManufacturers should:- Implement an effective emergency plan.- Train employees on the plan.- Install an evacuation alarm system that is audible and/or visible throughout the facility.- Conduct regular exercises to help ensure rapid evacuation to a safe location in an emergency.- Coordinate their emergency planning with offsite response organizations and the Local Emergency Planning Committee."
603,628,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Accident occurred during the  installation of a shut-off plate in a 3200mm pipeline containing blast furnace gas ,2006-04-18 16:30:00,2006-04-18 16:45:00,"The event occurred during the installation of a shut-off plate in a 3200mm pipeline containing blast furnace gas. The pipeline concerned was leaking blast furnace gas although the gate valve was shut. The working permit foresaw the use of self respirators as protective equipment. During the shut-off plate installation the team foreman from a contracting company lost consciousness and fell on the ground. Two more workers were affected taking off their self respirator masks during the intent to help the foremen. A fourth worker employed by ILVA was affected when he rushed from the ground floor to give assistance. The team foremen died during the transport to the hospital, while the two other workers and the employee of ILVA were hospitalised and dismissed after a few days following treatment in a hyperbaric chamber.The accident is notified to the European Commission, due to the one fatality occurred, applying annex VI point 2 of the Seveso II Directive.","The analysis of the official expert report has shown that the decease occurred due to CO intoxication, the CO was contained in the blast furnace gas. According to the technical expert report, the cause of the decease is attributed to an improper use of the self respirator mask. Further there deficiencies in the training programs for the personnel have been identified.The analysis of the accident causes as described above was deduced from the documentation provided by ILVA and from the technical consultancy report requested by the Attorney-General's Office during the legal proceedings in course in date 14/3/2007.In particular the conclusions of the technical consultancy report state that the fatal accident occurred because the victim had not been involved in an effective training and information process -on the presence of CO in the working area, -on the noxious effects of such gas if inhaled even for a very short period of time, and - on the crucial requirement to wear permanently personal protective equipment. This crucial requirement has not been respected by the worker during the operation, who several times removed his respirator mask to communicate over the phone. The behaviour of the worker is an infringement of the existing national norms D.LGs 629/94 and successive amendments and integrations, concerning art. 4,21 and 22.","The accident caused the death of one worker employed by a contracting company, the hospitalisation of two workers from another contracting company and of a worker employed by ILVA.The event did not cause material damage onsite nor offsite.Community Disruption - Remarks:The event caused a relevant coverage by the local and national press. The workers of ILVA went on strike from 23 hrs on 18/4/2006 to 7 hrs on 20/04/2006","The onsite fire brigade and the onsite sanitary relief service intervened in response to the event. Although emergency response measures were taken immediately, the emergency response operation encountered difficulties in reaching the accident point located in a gallery some 15 m from the ground, due to the presence of equipment and provisory structures.Emergency measures - Remarks: The onsite sanitary relief service and the onsite fire brigade intervened, providing first aid assistance to the persons involved in the accident and transported them from the accident point to the emergency response vehicles for the transport to hospital.
Measures have been taken to gather basic information for the accident analysis.
Official action taken - legal action: The Attorney General's office is investigating the causes of the fatal accident occurred to the worker. During this procedure an official technical consultancy report has been deposited, the report has been used to prepare the present report.Responce - Discussion about responce: Following measures have been adopted by the company:Relation with external contractors:-The company plans to modify the safety management system by increasing the frequency and type of preventive controls on the activities performed by the external contractors. - Further the company plans the integration and improvement of the content of the training courses for the external contracting companies and the onsite personnel.Revision of working permit delivery procedure: - Clearer definition of the responsibilities of the onsite personnel;- Modification of the forms with the objective to indicate clearer the hazard sources present in the work area;- Definition of standards concerning the information content of the safety reports to be presented by external contractors;- Definition of the authorisation delivery process to access the equipment and eventually use open flames.Mitigation measures:- The company has reinforced and optimized the sanitary service concerning the training of the doctors, nurses, drivers, security personnel and plant personnel, and&nbsp; foreseeing first aid measures provided by a series of vehicles with first aid equipment, dislocated onsite such to reach any accident point much faster than the onsite ambulance. - The onsite fire brigade has been reinforced from 4 members per shift to 6 memebrs. All members of the onsite fire brigade have received an integrative training of 120 hrs by the provincial fire department.The accident analysis has pointed out the difficulties encountered in reaching the working area in which the accident occurred, due to the presence of permanent equipment structures and provisory structures. For this reason the company has adopted measures to facilitate the access to the working areas (e.g. mobile platforms) and in this way facilitate the evacuation of the personnel in case of an emergency.The decision to equip the personnel with additional pressure air cylinders has the objective to facilitate the evacuation in safe condition in case of emergency, allowing to shut down the central air circulation system and automatically switch to the reserve air cylinders.Seveso II duties  - remarks: The safety report dated 2000 has
been evaluated with a negative result because the documentation
provided has been considered as insufficient. Presently the safety
report dated 2006 is under evaluation.
The accident scenarios considered in safety report did not take into
account the accident dynamics of this accident because it can not be
classified as accidental release. The accident was manged according to
the emergency response plan as generic emergency and as such was
competence of the onsite fire brigade and the onsite sanitary service.
The conclusion concerning inadequate training and information level
have been taken from the official technical consultancy report given in
charge by the Attorney General's Office and refers specifically to the
personnel of external contractors and subcontractors. The report does
not make any reference concerning the behaviour of the ILVA worker, who
rushed to the accident place without protective equipment.
","Measures to prevent recurrence: As consequence of the accident the company has taken following measures in order to avoid recurrence:- Improvement of the information procedures and training of external companies' personnel, with a particular focus on the hazards of the plant and the protective measures for specific operations on some equipment of the plant.- Improvement of the information procedures and training of the plant&nbsp; personnel on the hazards associated with the process gas present onsite, the methodologies to secure the gas pipeline system&nbsp; and the use of control equipment (e.g. gas detectors).- Revision of the work permit procedures with the goal to improve the prevention and protection measures adopted by external contractors- The company has been taking measures to modify the layout of the blast furnace gas pipeline system, by inserting specifically designed hermetic valves in order to reduce the need to employ shut-off plates.- Use of systems allowing an easy access to the working areas, such to reduce the response time in case of accident.-&nbsp; Use of reserve portable air cylinders integrating the 40 l service cylinders normally employed.Measures to mitigate consequences: - Reinforcement and optimization of the fire fighting service and the sanitary service in order to reduce the response time of the teams in case of accident- Use of systems allowing an easy access to the working areas, such to reduce the response time in case of accident.- Use of reserve portable air cylinders integrating the 40 l service cylinders normally employed."

The alert was sounded by staff in the boiler house, at the same time as the almost simultaneous triggering of the alarm by the fire detectors. Unit 1 was manually shut down immediately after the alarm, via the emergency stop, before other signals would have led to an emergency shutdown.The fire was extinguished by the regular fire service.
The thermal current and chimney effect in the boiler house proved to be highly effective in ventilating the smoke and heat. The high temperature and heat produced during the fire were rapidly discharged up towards the roof and out via the existing openings in the roof structure. The supply of fresh air at a very low outside temperature and the fact that the boiler house’s doors were partially open had a positive impact in this respect.
Safety measures:The alarm was raised by telephone call to the regular fire service, which arrived quickly on the scene (alarm raised at 17.15&nbsp;hrs, regular fire service on the scene by 17.27&nbsp;hrs).The fire was fully extinguished by around 20&nbsp;hrs.(No automatic sprinkler systems in the boiler area.)","The cause of the fire was identified as a leak from a defective pipe joint (‘cutting ring screw connection’) on a line conveying oil to a burner at a non-visible location.
When the cutting ring screw connection was assembled in 1988, the inserted pipe end on one side did not have its rough edges smoothed and it was not severed cleanly. As a result, the assembly was at an angle. Already at the time of assembly, the screwed coupling nut resulted in a non-uniform setting of the cutting ring, with discernible indents, which meant that it fell short of the intended fitting depth. The poorly fitted pipe was clearly exposed to higher pressures, causing the nuts to loosen over time and allowing the cutting ring to slip out of the conical seat of the housing; eventually the pipe slipped out of the joint, without significant external damage.
All the required components were present. There were no indications of material or manufacturing defects, fatigue or corrosion. In addition, all the other system joints are welded.According to the TRwS technical regulations for products hazardous to water, these types of line joint should be regarded as technically sealed and not subject to any specific inspection obligation.","Fire damage costs: EUR&nbsp;6,000,000

The pipe was pressurized with air at 8 bar and heated with warm water. After a pressure decrease down to 5 bar the pipe was unblocked and contemporaneously was released a certain quantity of phenol. The probable cause was the opening of a relief valve or of the vessel deck (over the ship) which was still under air pressure. Two seamen received phenol on their body (which is very dangerous in contact with the skin) notwithstanding they had gloves, special dresses and protective cask. This was due to the fact that the various protections were not perfectly linked between them. A seaman died one hour later, the other was hospitalised with serious chemical burns. The phenol that escaped over the ship bridge was diluted with water and removed. The quantity of escaped phenol was not so large to create serious pollution.","Pipe blockage
inappropriate design of plant/equipment/system
inappropriate action
The pipes on board of the ship were not heated, so that the phenol could crystallyze."," 1 immediate fatality
1 person hospitalized for chemical injuries
Insignificant river water pollution
no material damage apart the small loss of phenol.
The phenol is very venomous on contact with the skin; this is the reason for the serious consequences on the seamen.
No danger for the nearby environment.","Intervention of external fire-fighting services
Intervention of external victim-recovery services
Police intervention","The companies working with phenol and similar installations were alerted about the possible dangers in working with phenol.
In the future more serious control in the special protective dresses and in the linkage and sealing between the various elements."
607,1005,Other Event,Production of pharmaceuticals,Explosion in a batch reactor and fire,2012-11-06 04:50:00,2012-11-06 09:00:00,"On 6 November 2012 at approximately 04:50, an explosion occurred in one of the company's batch reactors. A fire then spread towards the top of the building. According to the results of the investigation, molsidomine decomposition was the cause of the accident (molsidomine is an end product of the process and is not classified under Seveso legislation). Prior to commencing production in 2007, the company carried out tests to determine the decomposition temperature of pure molsidomine (151 °C). Given that the temperature of the process does not normally exceed 55 to 60 °C, the company believed the process operated under safe conditions. The accident ultimately occurred during the 9th production run. In reality, at the stage in the process at which the explosion occurred, 300 kg of molsidomine and 275 kg of pyridinium salts (product of the reaction between the solvent pyridine (R11) and HCl) remained in the reactor.The pyridine was fully distilled at the time of the explosion and only traces were left in the reactor. Tests carried out after the accident demonstrate that the decomposition temperature of this mixture (molsidomine + salts) is 91 °C. The TD24 safe handling temperature is 65 °C (there is no risk of explosion if heated for 24 hours) and the hazardous temperature begins at 75 °C (there is a risk of explosion if exposed to heat for 1 to 8 hours), while the reaction process takes 7 hours. The double-jacketed reactor was steam-heated and as a result it is likely that the temperature in some parts of it exceeded 75 °C (in the gas phase). The decomposition of the mixture could therefore begin and then sustain its own heatingin blobs onto the reactor wall in the gas phase. Overpressure destroyed the glass componentsof the reactor (and the rupture disk) and the blast wave spread throughout the reactor room. The fragile wall of the building was blasted away/destroyed which prevented damage being caused to the structure of the building. A few burning projectiles were propelled around the room but were very quickly put out by the emergency team and fire brigade. However, one burning projectile smashed through a glass panel in the corridor of the upper floor. This corridor was being used to store empty drums/IBCs and wooden palettes (there were no Seveso substances in this area). The fire therefore spread and caused great damage to the corridor. Given its high location (5th floor) and the fact that the exact contents of the corridor were not known (the explosions were, in fact, caused by the expansion of empty metal drums resulting from exposure to heat from the fire), it took some time to extinguish the fire. The fire in the corridor was finally out at approximately 09:00. As a result, this accident cannot be defined as a major accident as it did not involve any classified product.","•	The decomposition temperature of pure molsidomine is 151 °C. The company therefore believed that they were under safe conditions since the temperature of the process did not exceed 60 °C. Tests carried out after the accident have shown that a risk of explosion could have already existed at 75 °C (for the mixture of molsidomine + salts). This temperature can be reached locally on the reactor walls.
•	Most of the damage caused by the fire came from the stock of empty drums/IBCs and wooden palettes in the corridor of the building. There was a single glass panel between the reactor room and this corridor. •	The reactor was equipped with two temperature sensors, one at the bottom (for the liquid phase) and one at the top (for the gas phase). The bottom sensor did not detect an increase in temperature because it was there that liquid was being mixed/cooled. The top sensor noted an abnormal increase in temperature more than an hour before the accident occurred. However, the operator was unable to see this temperature as it was not displayed. Given that at approximately 04:30 the operator had observed that the (bottom) temperature was displayed as normal (< 60 °C), he went on his break whilst this stage in the batch process finished. The (top) temperature continued to increase during this time (>100 °C before the explosion) which lead to the explosion at 04:50.","Nobody was injured in the accident. Fortunately, at the time of the explosion, the operator had left the reactor room to take his break. It was only the production building and the production equipment in close proximity to the explosion/fire that were damaged. The fragile walls constituting the front of the building and the roof have had to be replaced as they were destroyed by the explosion. Some rooms were damaged but these will be fit for use again once they have been restored. The reactor and instrumentation equipment were also destroyed by the explosion and fire. No consequences arose outside the company's premises.","The emergency team and fire brigade responded quickly, notably because the fire station was close by. Their response consisted above all of extinguishing the burning solid objects (wooden palettes etc.) in the corridor of the 5th floor. The authorities were initially unaware that the fumes released by the fire were not toxic. It took some time before it became known that it was a fire fuelled simply by wooden palettes and empty drums/IBCs and did not involve dangerous substances. This slowed down the initial response.","The decomposition temperature of a pure product can be much higher than the decomposition temperature of the same product mixed with other substances. Prior to commencing production, tests should be carried out on the actual mixtures in order to reflect reality more closely. Following the accident, the company repeated the laboratory tests for all production processes that required them. Combustible materials (e.g. wooden palettes) must never be stored in a production building even if it does not contain dangerous substances. The company has created a storage area outside the building. The openings (the glass panels) between the reactor rooms on the fourth floor and the corridor of the fifth floor have also been removed. The operator should be able to see all measurements. The company has made sure that all measurements from the temperature sensors are displayed to the operator."
608,516,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Release of hydrocarbons in gas and liquid form during the start-up process of the fractionating tower of a refinery,2005-08-07 16:46:00,2005-08-07 16:51:00,"In a refinery, 10 to 20 t of hydrocarbons in gas and liquid form were discharged in 5 min from 4.46 p.m. during the start-up process by 3 of 5 pressure relief valves of the fractionating tower. As there was a strong wind, some of the discharge fell on plants, homes and the beach in the nearby parish of Sausset les Pins; the traces found gave evidence that the zone affected by the discharge measured at least 1 km by 8 km. The accident could have had far more serious consequences in case that the cloud had passed near to the site's two flares or if the liquid part had fallen on the fractionating unit.The accident is notified in particular because it is classified level 6 of the accident gravity scale made official in February 1994 by the committee of competent authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directivce due to the environmental consequences caused by the accidental discharge (level 4 for dangerous substances released and level 3 for human and social consequences).","The accident was caused by a succession of errors during start-up procedures and in the information flow between and among shift personnel: tower abnormally full, numerous alarms ignored, etc., revealing failures and/or shortcomings concerning physical and/or organisational aspects (SGS)","Part of the discharge fell on plants, homes and the beach in the nearby parish of Sausset les Pins; the traces found indicate that the zone affected by the discharge measured at least 1 km wide by 8 km long. 70 children at a holiday centre were kept indoors, 7 of them were checked by doctors. One person slightly affected by the product was treated in hospital. Operating losses and external property damage could reach several million euros.
","The feed heating compressor stopped immediately to lower the pressure in the tower and stop the discharge. The local authority informed people concerned by fallout. 70 children at a holiday centre were kept indoors. 320 people were tasked with cleaning 132 swimming pools, 563 houses and 726 cars.

","First measures taken by the operator: - a pressure sensor was installed at the head of the tower to stop heating of the furnaces in the event of an upper pressure limit being reached,- stopping the heating and closing the furnace cycle feed valves (stopping the tower feed) when a load-loss limit is reached in the tower (upper difference threshold between the pressure at the bottom and head of the tower).&nbsp; "

The technical service immediately passed on this information to the on-site fire brigade. The fluid leakage stopped when the rinse water transfer sequence was terminated.
The technical service informed the electroplating foreman after Easter Weekend (23 April 2019). As an immediate measure, staff members were informed that accumulation of fluids in the acid receptacle was no longer permitted.
On 12 June 2019, there was leakage once again when a hydrochloric acid pipeline that runs through the acid receptacle began to leak.It was determined that the acid was leaking from another spot in the acid receptacle. A gap in the faulty joint measuring approximately 0.5 cm was discovered therein. The joint was sealed with special adhesive on 13 June 2019.
Safety measure:A notification was received from the sump in the underground sewer, and as a result, staff members from the technical service carried out a visual inspection during a patrol of the underground sewer, and the transfer of rinse water was stopped.","On 20 April 2019, leaks from a joint in the acid receptacle or a crack in the wall of the receptacle were suspected. The specific location of the leak however was not discovered until 12 June 2019 with the leakage of hydrochloric acid. There was a piece of a joint that had broken away.
The cause of this was likely ageing, i.e. material fatigue.
Opinion:The collecting basin, which dates from 1966, appears to be ageing to such an extent that, due to deterioration and fatigue, its containment capabilities must be called into question altogether. This however cannot be verified (as the majority of the collecting basin is below ground and inaccessible).
The flaw in the joint or the wall only became apparent during a patrol of the underground sewer, the only area that is accessible.","The leakage of these substances incurred costs related to the following measures:soil testing, waste disposal, emergency containers, rerouting of pipework (for changing the method of operation), remediation, and surveillance cameras. Costs: EUR 312,000.
Contamination was noted in the substructure and soil directly under the crack in the wall and the collecting basin. The affected area measures approximately 1 m3. Costs: EUR 5,000","During the event:Organisational measures implemented (terminating the transfer of rinse water from the acid receptacle and specifying that the collecting basin must no longer be used for the accumulation of fluids).
After the event:

Gauges installed;
Additional container (with a volume of 30 m³) acquired and installed for emergencies (collection of dangerous fluids during a fire or malfunction, etc.);
Leaking joint sealed;
On-site meeting with experts on the AwSV and the expert body on water management (district authority) organised;
Visual inspections of the underground sewer wall carried out once daily to check for any new leakage of fluids.

Since 9 May 2019, site contamination experts have been present on-site. Test boring of the buildings and soil matter conducted at various points in the walls and under the acid receptacle. Weekly inspections of the groundwater carried out by the operator’s laboratory.
Remedial measures only possible if the overall condition of the collecting basin can be clarified by the experts.
Remedial measures under the acid receptacle are difficult, and chromium contamination is present, according to the first laboratory analyses of the affected area; remediation is possible only if the acid receptacle is rebuilt.","
Immediate restoration of the functionality of the acid receptacle;
Description of how to approach a possible malfunctioning of the acid receptacle in the safety report;
Adjustment of the acid receptacle’s method of operation (more direct transfer of rinse water in pipes to the underground sewer, accumulation of fluids in the acid receptacle no longer necessary).

Functionality of the acid receptacle is sufficient."

613,834,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,LPG release during the maintenance of a blocked drain valve on the depropaniser reboiler,1990-11-29 15:15:00,1990-11-29 00:00:00,"An operator disconnected a drain assembly connected to the depropaniser reboiler until it was remained only a partially opened but blocked 50mm valve (from the Original Report it is not fully clear if it was a 50mm or a 15mm valve). The blockage was caused by caustic soda and the operator played steam over the valve to clear the blockage. The blockage was cleared but the operator was unable to close the gate valve due to caustic soda and LPG released at high temperature and pressure (the disconnection of the pipework was not done in accordance with the sites standing instructions). In order to reduce the pressure in the depropaniser to mininimise the amount of LPG escaping from the 50mm valve, a 406mm pneumatically operated depressurizing valve was opened. This valve, with a rated capacity of 13.375 tons per minute, was designed to depressurize the interconnected depropaniser and polypropylene splitter columns in 15 minutes via a 762mm line into the main 910mm flareheader. After the depressurizing valve was opened, the 50mm gate valve connected to the depropaniser was closed by an operator wearing breathing apparatus. The LPG released was safely dispersed. The emergency depressurising valve was open for 2'19"". At a low point in the 762mm line to the main flareheader described above there was located a small (254mm diameter, 600mm high) sump. At the bottom of this sump there was a 38mm diameter pipe to drain accumulated liquid into a nearby vessel. The liquid accumulated in this vessel was automatically pumped away. The sump was however blocked with debris and this allowed a large amount of liquid (about 30 m3) to accumulate in the 762mm line. The escaping gas from the depressurizing valve caused this liquid to be dispersed down the flareline and the forces generated caused about 100m of 762mm line to be displaced, falling approximately 10 metres to the ground. The pipeline buckled and in a few points there were some crackings. In one point a crack was found to have propagated through the 77% of the 10mm nominal thickness of the pipeline wall. The pipeline did not however failed and no LPG was released from this source.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The initiating event was the release of LPG through 15mm drain valve (initiallly blocked by caustic soda) connected to the depropaniser reboiler. The operator was unable to close the valve after its blockage was cleared out by means of steam. In order to reduce the amount of released LPG, the depropaniser and polypropylene splitter columns were depressurised via an emergency depressurising valve to a flareline. A  blockage in the flareline resulted in its displacement.
CAUSES:
The initiating event was caused by the blockage of a drain valve by caustic soda. The disconnection of the pipework was not done in accordance with the sites standing procedures that, however, were inadequate for clearing a pipe blockage. The flareline displacement was caused by the failure to maintain the line free of blockages (no written procedures were instituted to avoid it and, besides, the design of the flareline drainage arrangements made its maintenance difficult).","MATERIAL LOSS:The cost of reinstating the collapsed flareline was about 1,450,000 EurosAffected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The emergency depressurization of the interconnected depropaniser and polypropylene splitter columns was activated in order to minimize the amount of LPG released from the drain valve. After the activation of the emergency depressurization, the drain valve was closed by an operator wearing breathing apparatus. Besides, as precautionary measures:- all the areas in the vicinity of the plant were evacuated;- the internal fire brigade was alerted and attended incident;- mobile and fixed fire monitors were set-up downwind of the damaged sections of flareline;- roads in the area were closed;- the county fire brigades were called.Emergency measures - Remarks: The emergency depressurization of the interconnected depropaniser and polypropylene splitter columns was activated in order to minimize the amount of LPG released through the drain valve (code 7104) and the gate valve connected to the depropaniser was closed by an operator wearing breathing apparatus (code 7107).

The fire involved 25 tanks containing mainly light petroleum products. The sound of the explosion was heard at a great distance from the depot (up to Capri) and witnesses noticed the shock-wave up to Vico Equense. The explosion flame reached a length of hundreds metres. The explosion caused:1- the complete destruction of some buildings and damages to some industrial and civil premises in a radius of various hundred metres from the depot;2- the death of 4 people (two workers of the AGIP company inside the depot and two people living outside the depot, in a building beyond the Sperone channel;3- the injuring of many people hit by debris or fallen during the escape following the accident (the explosion caused a great panic in the population in a large area of the city);4- a large fire in the area of the SIF depot;5- serious damages to the road connecting the city of Naples (street ""Arnaldo Lucci"") to the high-way Napoli-Salerno;6- damages to the rail-way ""Circumvesuviana"".The fire that followed the explosion was characterized by high burning and energy rates of the combustion. There was risk of explosion of fixed roof tanks and propagation of the fire to the nearby areas (where there were others tanks) and to nearby critical industrial premises (Feltrinelli). Also, there was a risk of burned products flowing into the Sperone channel (with consequent damages to the activities in the harbour) and serious risks to the public health. Due to the successive collapse of some storage tanks engulfed in the fire, some fire-balls occurred and the flammable liquid contained was released into the dikes. It was a good choice to send foam (though more expensive) instead of water in the dikes to reduce the effects of the collapse of tanks. In this way the whole amount of available water was used to cool the tanks and the risk of dikes overfilling and, therefore, of the spreading of fire to other areas was avoided.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
During ship unloading operations, a leak of flammable/explosive liquid from tank No 17 occurred. The vapours were ignited resulting in a violent explosion which involved 25 tanks (SIF area) containing flammable substances. The explosion was followed by a fire that involved the SIF area.
CAUSES:
The release of the flammable/explosive liquid from tank No 17 during loading operations was caused by the loose of control of the gate valves position by the two operators in charge of the operation. It caused the overfilling of the tank and the liquid overflowing from it. The released vapours formed a cloud that was ignited in an adjacent area, causing a violent unconfined vapour cloud explosion (U.V.C.E.).","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:2 people inside the depot (in charge of the unloading operations) and 2 people living in a destroyed building outside the depot were killed by the explosion. Many people (about 100) were injured (and hospitalized) because they were hit by debris or fallen during the escape following the accident (the explosion caused a great panic in the population in a large area of the city).MATERIAL LOSS AND COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The accident caused great damage to the depot and to its structures. Also caused:1- the complete destruction of some buildings and damage to some industrial and civil premises in a radius of various hundred metres from the depot (about 220 civil buildings, 12 large buildings and 448 industrial or artigianal units were damaged);2- serious damage to the road connecting the city of Naples (street ""Arnaldo Lucci"") to the high-way Napoli-Salerno;3- damage to the rail-way ""Circumvesuviana"".MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The depot was in an area with a high density of population, close to civil buildings.Ecological harm - Remarks: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms because, though there was a risk of burned products flowing into the Sperone Channel (with consequent damages to the activities in the harbour), nothing happened.Disruption of community life: A large area around the depot had been declared off limits. Ships had been moved away from the harbour.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:To fight the fire for avoiding its propagation to the nearest tank No 101 full of diesel oil and the ignition of the other tanks in case of their rupture and escape of flammable liquid, immediately after the explosion arrived on the scene:- 6 fire fighting teams,- the fire fighting team of the refinery;- the fire fighting team of harbour;- fire fighting teams from the other provinces of Campania.The day after, since the fire was still huge, others 180 firemen, 15 officers and many fire fighting means were called.Due to the successive collapse of some storage tanks engulfed in the fire, some fire-balls occurred and the flammable liquid contained was released into the dikes. It was a good choice to send foam (though more expensive) instead of water in the dikes to reduce the effects of the collapse of tanks. In this way the whole amount of available water was used to cool the tanks and the risk of dikes overfilling and, therefore, of the spreading of fire to other areas was avoided.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:1- a large area around the depot had been declared off limits and it was prohibited the entrance of the personnel;2- ships had been moved away from the harbour.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to mitigate consequences: Due to the successive collapse of some storage tanks engulfed in the fire, some fire-balls occurred and the flammable liquid contained was released into the dikes. It was a good choice to send foam (though more expensive) instead of water in the dikes to reduce the effects of the collapse of tanks.

615,866,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Explosion in a cold strip mill,2010-05-05 13:25:00,2010-05-05 13:26:00,"Three contractors were intent on removing bolts from a manhole cover (DN 600) in order to enable an expert inspecting the storage tank which contained hydrofluoric acid. In addition to spanners the contractors also used an angle grinder. A gas explosion ensued (hydrogen). Two workers were hit and fatally injured by the generated blast overpressure and the manhole cover thrown upwards by the explosion. When the company’s fire service arrived, one of the workers was lying on the ground in front of the storage facility while the other one was lying on a platform situated at approximately 10 metres high and adjacent to the storage tank. The thrown up manhole cover went through the roof of a neighbouring production hall located approximately 50-60 metres away from the storage facility, causing fortunately only minor material damage.","In the course of cleaning work on the hydrofluoric acid storage tank, the residual of concentrated hydrofluoric acid remaining in the tank was diluted with water and not completely neutralized with sodium hydroxide. Subsequently, the container was sealed. Thereafter, according to the operator, the cleaning work was interrupted for at least 2 days. During this time, as a result of the reaction of the dilute hydrofluoric acid with the iron material of the container, hydrogen was formed, so that an explosive atmosphere was formed. When the cleaning work resumed, the explosive mixture was ignited presumably by the sparking due to the work with an angle grinder.",Fatalities: 2 personsInjuries:&nbsp; &nbsp;2 persons,In-house staff reported the accident to the company fire service command centre. The fire brigade was immediately deployed. An ambulance and a rescue vehicle from the local fire brigade were called as the company fire service was on its way. The injured were attended to by both the works rescue service and the company medical staff while the situation was assessed. A further ambulance and rescue vehicle were called in. Measures were taken to resuscitate the injured. The site was cordoned off and cleared of unauthorised persons. Measurements at the tank opening did not reveal any significantly elevated readings.&nbsp;,"As a measure, it was stated that technical safety provisions (suction) are to be provided to prevent the formation of an explosive atmosphere inside the containers. Maintenance can then take place with the exhaust air switched on."
616,6,Major Accident,Other activity (not otherwise specified int the list),Polyurethane Panel Factory,2016-03-29 13:30:00,2016-03-29 18:30:00,"The incident started in the upper level above the panel foam production area for production line 3, at a height of approximately 4 metres above floor level. This upper level area was partially closed on the side and adjacent to the finished products store (polyurethane sandwich panels). The upper level area is not clearly defined as one of the plant’s units (storage/production); its function was to reduce the volume of the production area below to ensure that it was sufficiently warm to enable the reaction needed to produce polyurethane foam, which is a continuous process. Some polyethylene spools were stored in the upper level area, even though they were not used there. The spools were in fact used in the panel finishing production line. During the incident, production line 3 was in operation under the upper level area, where polyurethane panels were being manufactured using pentane (from the raw material tank MP via an underground pipe that was cut off at source during the fire, at the point where it is turned on at the pump, by the operator manually blocking the production line) and using the catalyst (taken from the MP tank via an underground pipe from the tank that was subsequently entirely destroyed in the blaze). The fire, which started in the upper level, rapidly spread to the production line below, the rock wool panel production line, the curved panel production line, a finished products store (storage area 3), a stock of chemical products comprising five tanks for storing isocyanate of 35 m3 each, five tanks for storing polyol of 35 m3 each and two tanks for storing the catalyst (N&nbsp;N-dimethylcyclohexylamine) of 12.5 m3 each.","The incident was in all probability caused by soldering work that was being carried out by two contracted companies, required to change (move) the container for storing pentane to a new area considered to be more safe.Direct causes -Event that initiated the incident:a fire started through contact between a soldering spark that fell onto combustible material (spools of polyethylene) that was in the work area, and then spread to the entire wing of the building, setting alight dangerous substances in a secondary outbreak.Major event:a fire that spread throughout the entire building used for the production of polyurethane foam (finished products and covering material) which entails the use of Seveso-category dangerous substances (pentane, residual quantities trapped in the underground pipe supplying the production line, and the catalyst in the raw material storage area plus the residual amount in the pipe).Root Causes, which can be attributed to management failures in the safety management system (SMS):

performing soldering in an area that is not totally safe on account of the unjustified presence of a combustible material in the upper level area;
the absence, at the time of the incident, of a specific procedure specifying how to perform the work for which permission has been granted; the interference risk assessment document (Documento Unico di Valutazione dei Rischi Interferenziali - DUVRI) was filled out for the work carried out (compulsory under health and safety at work legislation); this does not replace the work permit in the strict sense. However, the DUVRI used (dated 1.2.16) specifies that safely measures were to be adopted in the event of any soldering work, such as: blocking off the location where the soldering takes place with appropriate screens, so as to avoid sparks or burning material falling on people or on flammable materials; keeping any combustible/flammable materials away from the location; keeping one or more fire extinguishers to hand to be able to take immediate action in an emergency; Measures that it emerged had not been carried out; Failure to respect the safety provisions laid down in the interference risk assessment document (DUVRI);
The external company used for soldering work in a production area of combustible materials was not sufficiently qualified to do so: failure to define the criteria for selecting service provider companies. Failure to check the training given to external companies;
The SMS safety management system was never audited nor inspected; had it been, the above-mentioned failings would have come to light.
","The damage incurred was mainly material, as the entire west wing of the plant was destroyed (a building of 16&nbsp;000 m2). The fire notably destroyed the rock wool panel production line, the curved panel production line, a finished product store (store 3), a stock of chemical products comprising five tanks for storing isocyanate of 35 m3 each, five tanks for storing polyol of 35 m3 each and two tanks for storing the catalyst (N&nbsp;N-dimethylcyclohexylamine) of 12.5 m3 each + 20 movable containers of 1 m3 each.
Burning polyurethane and its individual components create toxic smoke. The plume of smoke rose to a height of approximately 400 metres; the inversion of the vertical thermal gradient resulted in an interface that acted as a roof&nbsp;coming into contact with the cloud of smoke. The cloud moved north-west, borne on a light wind, spreading over a couple of kilometres before completely dispersing into the atmosphere. The relatively calm weather meant that the plume of smoke reached considerable distances with regard to its point of origin as it scarcely mixed with the surrounding air. The huge fire produced a black cloud that could be seen from kilometres away, as declared by the Prefecture, and spreaded over the connecting streets (closed to traffic) and the surrounding areas; the Prefecture declared a state of emergency to ensure the intervention of the fire brigade and ambulances and adopted precautionary measures to safeguard the population. The relevant health and environmental agencies were instructed to monitor and test the area&rsquo;s water, air and soil in the province concerned and the neighbouring province, belonging to other region. Pending the results of the monitoring and tests, the mayors of the municipalities concerned issued emergency orders adopting a series of precautionary measures to protect public health.&nbsp; On 8 April following the results of the monitoring plan, almost all the restrictive measures were lifted. As a purely precautionary measure, certain restrictions on livestock grazing and harvesting fodder in the area concerned were maintained. The tests carried out by the environmental agencies detected a concentration of toxic substances below the legal limits for both the air and the soil.","At the moment when the fire broke out in the departments affected by the incident, 14 employees were present, of whom two fire officers, plus two external workers. Given the presence of flames in the upper level area, the workers intervened immediately, as provided for in the Emergency Intervention Plan (PEI), and tried to extinguish them with portable fire extinguishers. Although the fire extinguishers were used promptly, they were not sufficient to put out the flames, given that the fire had spread with extreme speed and reached the roofing panels. The foreman (and the fire safety officer), having realised that it was not possible to tackle the emergency with the firefighting equipment on site, ordered the evacuation of all workers present and took steps to secure the plant, specifically by: turning off the electricity in the area affected by the fire and the immediate vicinity; cutting off the gas and liquid fuel supply. At the same time, the other fire safety officer called the Fire Brigade. When the fire brigade and ambulance service arrived on the scene, at around 14.05, a considerable area of the plant was already on fire and - to be more precise - the west wing, partly used for production and partly as a store for polyurethane sandwich panels. Given the speed with which the blaze spread, aided by the wind, and the intense production of thick black smoke, the combustibility of the products present, the huge quantities of product in storage and finally the presence of a storage tank of inflammable liquids (polyol and isocyanate), the sole operational possibility was to avoid the fire spreading to other adjacent areas both to the east and the west. The laminated wooden frame connecting the reinforced concrete and metal load bearing pillars was totally burned in the fire, causing the structural collapse of the roof and the lateral buffer walls, which imploded.
At approximately 19.00, the moment at which the flammable liquids in the metal above-ground storage tanks located to the west of the plant stopped burning, the fire could be considered under control, although the material stacked inside continued to produce flames and smoke even after that time. The extinguishing operation continued throughout the night and part of the next day.
Overall 22 fire engines and other devices, including a helicopter and an air tank, were used to extinguish the fire, contributed by various Fire Brigades. All the staff present implemented the internal emergency plan properly. The prompt activation of the emergency plan meant that all the workers were grouped together in a safe area and the fire was prevented from spreading to the dangerous substances on site in the plant. The external emergency plan was also activated. The technical departments of the relevant health and environmental agencies were instructed to monitor and test the water, air and soil in the province concerned and the neighbouring province. Pending the results of the monitoring and tests, the mayors of the relevant municipalities issued emergency orders adopting a series of precautionary measure to protect public health. The measures were maintained for ten days, until the test results received back from the various laboratories confirmed that the concentrations were below legal limits in all environmental media (air, water and soil).
After the emergency, and the clean up of the water used to extinguish the fire inside the building that was collected in the water recovery system and of the surrounding area, the plant restarted operations immediately.","The need to ensure that areas where processes requiring heat are carried out are totally secured;&nbsp;

the need to set up specific procedures for work permits in order to properly manage contracted work; the work permit must be drawn up and tailored to the specific work to be performed; it needs to identify the individual transfers of responsibility for performing the various steps in the work process between the company and the external companies, define the specific risks in the work environment, how to make them safe and by what means, specify the result of the action taken and how to put the plant back into operation;
the need for external companies used to outsource specific tasks to be adequately informed, trained and verified with regard to the risks associated with the work to be carried out on site;
the need to properly define the criteria for selecting the companies used for outsourcing, especially those carrying out hot work;
the need properly audit the company’s SMS management system, to as to bring any shortcomings in the system to light.

More generally, manufacturing companies where negligible quantities of dangerous substances are used only peripherally in the production process, and that play a peripheral role with regard to the volume of production and the quantities of the finished products produced, have a tendency to consider their actual conditions as ‘less critical’ compared to other Seveso cases, and therefore to adopt an SMS that is generally ‘not sufficient’ to securely manage a context that should not in actual fact be underestimated (the presence of considerable quantities of combustible material) for its potential to increase the seriousness of any potential accident."

The gasometer jacket also in the future will be filled with electrolytic hydrogen. The hydrogen control valve will be closed for reached peak load in the storage vessel. In the condenser aspiration pipe formed an underpressure. In the gas aspiration line was installed a water trap, whose drain had a plastic tube stopped that in turn was submerged in the bottom of a plastic tube filled with water. For the underpressure the water was aspirated out of the plastic tube, but deposits remained in the lower parts. Due to an underpressure protection the mean pressure condenser failed. Now the back flowing air arrived to the high pressure condenser. The hydrogen formed together with the air an explosive gas which autoignited.

The biogas plant has been provided with a connection for an emergency generator set.The filling level of the digestate in digestate store 3 is said to have been around one-third (approx. 1.80&nbsp;m). However, this cannot be verified.The gas link between digestate store 3 and digestate store 4 was closed due to the damage that had occurred on 24 February 2017.During the work on the transformer (12:00 - 14:00), the electricity supply to the entire biogas plant frequently failed.
The biogas still being produced in the three lines is compressed entirely by means of gas compressors for gas processing. Lines 1 and 2 have a gas interconnection via digestate store 1 and digestate store 2. Digestate store 2 has a storage function thanks to its inflatable roof with a flexible internal membrane.
Without power supply, the outlet gas compressor for gas processing and the emergency flares do not work. The overpressure and underpressure protection of digestate store 3 and digester 3 were not able to release sufficiently the quantity of biogas produced during the power failure. According to the digitally documented measurements, the pressure in the system increased from 5% (approx. 0.5 mbar, 10:30) to an initial peak (30%, approx. 11:50) to 65% (approx. 3.9&nbsp;mbar, approx. 14:00) before then the roof of the digestate store tore and the pressure fell again.
Safety measures:Immediate closure of all gates in the gas system.In order to prevent further overflow of substrate from digester 3 into digestate store 3, the fill level of the digester was lowered by pumping. Digestate store 3 was emptied and prepared for the installation of a new roof.","The tear in the roof of digestate store 3 was caused by a steep increase in pressure from approx. 0.5&nbsp;mbar to 3.9&nbsp;mbar between 12:00 and 14:00. This increase in pressure can be explained by the fact that the biogas produced in digester 3 and digestate store 3 could not be extracted from the sub-installation.
At this time, work was being carried out on the power supply in order to implement a robust emergency power plan. For this reason, the biogas temporarily could not be moved on either by compressors for gas processing or by flares from the plants. It was not possible to reconstruct whether the pressure relief device had started to be discharged at the set pressure of approximately 3.5 mbar. The pressure increased beyond that to approximately 3.9 mbar until the roof of digestate store 3 tore.
The damage of 20 June 2017 therefore occurred as a result of a simple disruption of operation through internal pressure that was too high for the worn roof. The installed, inherently safe overpressure and vacuum protection system was not able to sufficiently reduce the internal pressure before the worn roof was destroyed.","Torn roof.Costs: &euro; 25,000","Gas from fermenter disconnected, partial emptying of digester 3 in order to avoid further overflow into digestate store 3, emptying of digestate store 3.","

It was planned to substitute the gas pressure pipe being part of the reactor ethylene effective pressure measurement system. During shut down the operations of the plant the polymer in the high pressure separator&nbsp; (operative temperature 250° C) is washed out of the container with cold ethylene (ca. 100° C).12 kg of ethylene were released in the atmosphere due to a leakage in the flange coupling between the the high pressure separator and the low pressure separator. The released ethylene burned until the explosion occurred. As consequence of the fire the emergency relief valves of the reactors and the emergency relief valve of the wax separating pipe were triggered. The released ethylene ignited such that approximately 6 - 10 kg ethylene were burned. The rapid pressure release of the reactor caused secondary damage -&nbsp; the core barrel fissured and longitudinal fissure occurred in the external layer of&nbsp; the multiple layer container.,"Causes according to present knowledge.
The temperature gradient occurring during shut down of the plant cools the gasket faster as the neighbouring parts (screws, flanges. This stress is normally absorbed by the corresponding screw tightening of the Gray_Lock gasket. The leak occurred due to insufficient tightening of the above mentioned flange coupling elements.

632,253,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Accident during the production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) in a steam heated reactor,1989-01-09 00:00:00,1989-01-09 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The accident occurred during the production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) in a reactor heated with steam at a temperature of 165-175°C. The reaction was carried out without ad adequate addition of ammonia and therefore the normal small hydrogen chloride production could not be compensated. Hence, the excess of hydrogen chloride destabilized the suspension of PVC-latex which coagulated. The coagulation of the latex caused the mixer failure but there was no indication of it. Consequently, a local overheating resulted and a decomposition on PVC occurred because the steam temperature (165-175°C) was higher that the PVC decomposition temperature (144°C). Being the PVC decomposition exothermic, the heat caused an expansion of coagulated latex clogged all the pipings including the inlet to the bursting disc and to the safety valve. The uncompensated hydrogen chloride started to react with the material&nbsp; of the reactor (the Duplex stainless steel was not resistant against hydrogen chloride at high temperatures). Though the steam supply had been stopped and the external cooling started (activated by the release of hot gases from the reactor), the vessel burst because the wall thickness was reduced from 9.8 mm to 2 mm. Activation of the sprinkler system enhanced reactor cooling and diluted the hydrogen chloride vapours.","CAUSES:Due to a human error, PVC-latex with insufficient ammonia was used, resulting in the coagulation of the suspension. It caused the agitator failure (there were no indication of its failure) and therefore a not detected local overheating occurred. Overheating resulted in a runaway reaction because the steam temperature (about 165-175°C) was higher than the latex decomposition temperature (about 140oC).","Ecological harm - Remarks: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms. The concentration of hydrogen chloride in air was measured outside the establishment but no gas was detected at a distance of approximately 1,000 metres from the plant because the release of the gases from the reactor activated the sprinkler system, resulting in cooling of the vessel and dilution of the hot mixture that reduced the emission rate of hydrogen chloride into the environment.Material loss - Remarks: The cost of the material damages to the reactor and to the plant caused by the explosion has been estimated at about 0.45M Euros).Disruption of community life: In the Original Report there is no evidence of effects outside the establishment. The concentration of hydrogen chloride in air was measured outside the establishment but no gas was detected at a distance of approximately 1,000 metres from the plant because the release of gases from the reactor activated the sprinkler system, resulting in cooling of the vessel and dilution of the hot mixture that reduced the emission rate of hydrogen chloride into the environment.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Though the steam supply was stopped and the external cooling of the reactor was applied (the hot gases released from the vessel activated the sprinkler system), the local weakening of the vessel wall around the steam inlet (thickness was reduced from 9.8 mm to 2 mm due to the hydrogen chloride attack) was too fast to prevent the physical explosion of the reactor.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The concentration of hydrogen chloride in air was measured outside the establishment but no gas was detected at a distance of approximately 1,000 metres from the plant because the release of gases from the reactor activated the sprinkler system, resulting in cooling of the vessel and dilution of the hot mixture that reduced the emission rate of hydrogen chloride into the environment.Therefore, no off-site emergency measures were necessary. No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:1- substitution of the plasticizing agent and use of steam with a maximum temperature of 127°C (latex starts decomposing at 140°C);2- installation of a double signalling device on the mixer for the detection of malfunctions;3- interlock of the steam supply to the mixer so that the steam supply will be automatically shut off in the case of agitator failure;4- installation of two independent temperature sensors. The steam supply will be automatically shut off if any of the sensors indicates a temperature above 100°C or when there is a substantial difference in indications of the two sensors;5- installation of a level switch which will automatically shut off the steam supply when a high level in the reactor is reached;6- installation of a pressure switch (set at 1 bar overpressure) which will automatically shut off the steam supply when a high pressure is reached;7- all these steam shut off actions to be coupled to an alarm signal in control room;8- batch control on quality, pH and persulphate contents to be introduced;9- during the process the pH to be monitored through regular sampling; the possibility of continuous pH-monitoring to be investigated."
633,895,Major Accident,"Processing of ferrous metals (foundries, smelting, etc.)",Blast furnace gas outflow followed by CO dispersion,2006-11-16 06:37:00,2006-11-16 08:45:00,"At 06:37 on 16 November 2006 the plant experienced a drop in its power supply, i.e. a reduction in voltage on lines 277 and 278, which supply the plant with electricity from the nearby substation. This brief drop in voltage triggered the closure of the BFG supply pipes, resulting in the shut-down of the main BFG draw-off points (heating-plant boilers Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6, and the combustion boilers of push furnaces 1 and 4) and other, smaller BFG draw-off points at the plant. This caused a substantial increase in pressure in the main BFG distributor (about 16 kPa), followed by the extinction of the burners on BFG stacks 2 and 3 (increase in BFG flow to maximum) and the bursting open of pressure traps on the main BFG distributor (26 traps). This resulted in a release of BFG, which was signalled by the CO monitoring system (external and internal CO monitoring at the plant). The CO release was reported at 06:45 and emergency control arrangements were put in place; the Energy Division’s control centre requested a reduction in the supply of BFG by 200 000 Nm3/hour, by reducing blasting. At the same time, action was taken by the company’s own fire brigade (air quality monitoring, adding and closing of pressure traps, evacuation of employees), and by the company’s private security service (closure of roads). After the necessary technical measures had been performed on the installations (gradual ignition of the burners of the heating plant boilers and of the combustion boilers of the push furnaces, shut-down of blast furnace No 2 – interruption of the blasting of hot air, resulting in a reduction in the production of iron and of BFG), pressure in the main BFG distributor gradually fell until a stable value of 2-6 kPa was reached. At 08:00, the levels of released CO in the air were falling, as most of the pressure traps had already been closed. At 09:05, the company's fire brigade stopped monitoring CO levels at the plant and in its immediate vicinity; the CO values were within the legal limits. The evacuation was completed; production continued unchanged after the MIA had been dealt with. Seven vehicles equipped with measuring devices for monitoring CO releases to air were deployed.The evacuation of the plant’s employees and employees of external firms was organised and directed by controllers from the Coking Plant, Hot-Rolling, Cold-Rolling, Transport, Service and Energy Divisions, and implemented by the company’s fire brigade, company's fire brigade, and its private security service. A total of 359 people were evacuated. The evacuation point was determined in accordance with the divisional emergency plans and in line with measurements taken using personal analysers; nobody was injured during the evacuation.No injuries were sustained by employees and no damage was done to technical installations during the MIA, the major occurrence of which took place between 06:37 and 08:45.","The initial cause of the emergency was the failure of the electricity supply from the supplier (omissis substation), a drop in voltage on power lines 277 and 278 to 0.3 Un for a period of 0.75 s (a drop in the phase voltage to 6 kV, and to less than 2 kV in some cases, in the company's power cables).The second cause was that safeguard installations (back-up sources) were non-existent or inadequate, as were the measures to address such an emergency, as a result of which some of the key appliances using the BFG (heating plant boilers K1, K3, K55 and K6 and push furnace combustion boilers (SKNP) Nos 1 and 4) at the company's plant failed.",Impact on human life: none.Impact on human health: none.Environmental damage: none.

The investigation formed the basis for a report which was forwarded to the omissis Environment Office in accordance with Act No 261/2002 on the prevention of major industrial accidents.MEASURES PROPOSED AND ADOPTEDFollowing the MIA, the plant operator took the following measures, setting deadlines for their implementation:• Temporary procedure for operation at up to 120 000 m3 until start-up of BFG storage tank (deadline: 16 November 2006);• Start-up of heating plant boiler No 2 to increase BFG draw-off – total of six boilers (deadline: 16 November 2006);• Further investigation of an event two weeks previously – combustion stack outage (deadline: 24 November 2006);• Verification of functioning of stacks, their supply and control from the control room in the event of undervoltage – simulated undervoltage (deadline: 4 December 2006);• Establishment of three crews to work in emergencies using protective insulating devices (deadline: 24 November 2006);• Allocation to the anti-gas protection post of one-hour protective insulation devices – at least 30% of devices (deadline: 24 November 2006);• Training for every shift maintenance team on priority treatment of stack control and the site of potential failures (deadline: 24 November 2006);• Installation of a back-up source for heating-plant boiler No 1 and a stack management system in the CO monitoring control room (deadline: 31 December 2006);The plant operator has adopted the following official measures to prevent the recurrence of a major industrial accident of this or a similar type.• Continuous operational control of the volume of BFG burnt in combustion stacks 2 and 3 in order to cope with the failure of a major draw-off appliance and to monitor the stacks in accordance with the occupational safety procedure (deadline: 18 November 2006);• Increase in the stability of supply to the burners of heating-plant boiler No 1 in the event of undervoltage (back-up source) (deadline: end 2006);• Identification of critical equipment in the light of the installation of back-up sources, and preventive maintenance for back-up sources (deadline: Q1 2007);• Archiving of data (detailed records) from the omissis system for one week (deadline: 30 November 2006);• Proposal for a system for monitoring power supply and losses in the case of high-voltage substations and establishment of harmonised system time for operational computers (deadline: Q1 2007);• Proposal for on-off arrangement for combustion stacks at approximately 100 000 m3 (deadline: technical development panel – December 2006);• Proposal for self-regenerating pressure traps for gas (deadline: end 2006).The omissis Inspectorate, in accordance with Section 13(3)(b) of Act No 95/2000 on labour inspection and amending certain acts, as amended, has ordered the Company to:• Ensure adequate risk assessment and adopt safety measures to ensure safety and health at work so that a power cut or drop in the electricity supply does not result in an uncontrolled release of BFG to the air and put at risk the safety and health of employees and other persons present on the employer’s premises (deadline: immediate and continuous);• Ensure removal of BFG from pressure traps so that they are not located in the breathing zone, in accordance with Section 6(1)(d) of Act No 124/2006 on safety and health at work;- Deadline: within 30 days from receipt of the report.The omissis Environment Office has proposed the following measures:• Drafting of an emergency scenario for this type of BFG release from BFG distributor pipes;• Incorporation of this scenario in the plant’s emergency plan;• Adaptation of the risk assessment with regard to the main BFG distributor to take suitable account of similar situations;The deadline for the measures proposed by the omissis Office is the date of the next updating of the Company plant’s safety report.CONCLUSION AND EVALUATIONOn the basis of the information received from the omissis Inspectorate, which investigated the MIA at the Company plant, and of knowledge gained from the omissis Environment Office’s own activities, it may be concluded that the MIA was not caused by negligence on the part of the plant’s employees or operator, or by other organisations or persons present at the plant. The omissis Inspectorate has detected an infringement of the law, notably Section 6(1)(c), (d) and (f) of Act No 124/2006 on safety and health at work and amending certain acts and provisions, in that the organisation did not adequately assess the risk and also did not take safety measures to ensure safety and health at work so that a power cut or drop in the electricity supply does not result in an uncontrolled release of BFG to the air and put at risk the health and safety of employees and other persons present on the employer’s premises. The omissis Inspectorate has not imposed any penalties or issued a prohibition on the operation of the installation.The omissis Environment Office has proposed measures to prevent major industrial accidents at the Company which it will apply rigorously to the operator in the imminent updating of the plant’s safety report provided for in Section 9 of Act No 261/2002 on the prevention of major industrial accidents and amending certain acts, as amended.The major industrial accident at the Company occurred – and was caused – as result of a power supply failure and the subsequent failure of the plant’s technical and safety installations."

The automatic sprinkler system intervened.
ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
A small explosion with a subsequent fire occurred during the addition of a powdered pharmaceutical product through a stainless steel charge chute into a chemical reactor containing acetone at 40 degrees Celsius. The fire damaged a nearby control panel and electric cable insulation. As no operators were in the vicinity of the charge chute when the explosion occurred no one was injured. The charging operator had just started operating the control valve on the acetone addition line (3 metres away) when the explosion occurred.","CAUSES:
Investigations showed that the procedure was not a normal one because dry powder was added to the flammable solvent instead of the usual wet cake. The powder was a finished product that did not passed quality control purity test and had to be recrystallized. No nitrogen inerting was used and, as some acetone vapours would have been emitted from the charging chute, the combustion was made possible. The insufficient operational procedures for this situation allowed to carry out it without considering the risk of a dust explosion. The most likely source of ignition was an electrostatic discharge resulting either from splash filling of the acetone or from the chute charging of the finely divided pharmaceutical powder.","MATERIAL LOSS:The cost of the fire damages (to a nearby control panel, to the electric cable insulation and to the paint) has been evaluated at about 0.0013 M Euros.People - Remarks: No operators were in the vicinity of the charge chute when the explosion occurred, so no one was injured.Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire was quickly extinguished by the intervention of the automatic sprinkler system.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:No off-site emergency measures were required.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the company was requested to carry out:

The operator triggered its internal emergency plan at 12:40 p.m. and the prefect triggered the external emergency plan at 1:14 p.m. because of the potential risk that the large plume of smoke coming from the building was toxic. A nearby school was locked down. The 400 employees at the site were evacuated. The site’s emergency response team protected the nearby equipment while making sure that water was not sprayed into the acid baths. The emergency services put in place a security perimeter and traffic was closed off on a departmental road and on a railway. Given the scale of the accident, the firefighters fought the fire directly on the treatment line baths and put it out at around 2:30 p.m. The 88 pupils and staff at the school were released from lockdown at 2:33 p.m. after an analysis of the air in the schoolyard. The installation affected was made safe and the lockout-tagout procedure was followed.","The fire broke out in a bath on the surface treatment line and then rapidly spread to the entire line. The bath was being filled after cleaning. A defect in a level sensor, acknowledged by staff, caused the bath to begin heating up automatically (immersion heater) with no liquid in it. In this scenario, it took only a few minutes for the hard rubber tank situated 10 cm from the immersion heater to catch fire. The absence of full fire separation between the baths and the fact that the ventilation system was on meant that the fire spread quickly to the other baths. What is more, the unit’s staff were in a briefing session when the fire broke out, which is why it was not detected quickly. As the automated system did not have the necessary redundancies, an incorrectly measured liquid level caused it to fail.",The atmospheric measurements carried out (sulphur dioxide) did not reveal any toxicity. The firewater in the retention tank (45 m&sup3;) was pumped out on the evening of the accident and analysed before being sent for treatment by an authorised firm. A soil and vegetation sampling plan was put in place within 5 days to check for possible pollution. No impact was identified. The fire destroyed 200 m&sup2; of the building. The operator estimates the cost of the damage at more than &euro;2 million.,"The operator triggered its internal emergency plan at 12:40 p.m. and the prefect triggered the external emergency plan at 1:14 p.m. because of the potential risk that the large plume of smoke coming from the building was toxic.

637,270,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Mass explosion of fireworks warehouse,2000-05-13 15:25:00,2000-05-13 15:30:00,"The accident started with a fire. 3 Explosions occurred. Water contamination cannot be excluded.A fire started in the repackaging area. The fire jumped across to other storage rooms and eventually caused a mass explosion of the stored fireworks.The process of escalation that lead to the disaster started in the repackaging area C2. The cause of the initial fire in this area has not been clarified. Suggested causes are: arson, auto-ignition of a so-called flash-cord, short circuiting of an improvised electricity conduit in C2 or the (illegal) handling/using of fireworks on May 13. The fire was not noticed until external effects occurred. When the fire brigade arrived at the scene, the fire had probably been going on for at least 25 minutes. By that time several fires had started in the area, caused by ejected fireworks. At a certain point in time, a fire started in a triangle between two containers and the concrete fencing of the site. Even after the fire in C2 was brought under control, smoke and later flames and ignited fireworks were detected from the adjacent bunker C4. A suggested scenario how the fire spread to this bunker is that it passed through the 7 centimeter diameter water-pipe lead-through in the wall between C2 and C4. Consequently, the fire brigade detected the fire in the triangle between the two containers (E2 and E15) and the concrete fence. Attempts to extinguish this fire were complicated by the inaccessability of the triangle. At this moment the fire had probably already spread to the contents of container E2. This may be concluded from the fact that shortly after the fire brigade had started extinguishing the fire in the triangle, they observed signs of fire in container E2. Shortly afterwards, container E2 exploded. This explosion caused a large flame in the direction of the central storage. However, this has probably not been the main factor in the following escalation. Ejected heavy fireworks from E2 exploded in front of the MAVO boxes, probably struck through the doors of these boxes and ignited its contents. Within one minute after the explosion of container E2, the MAVO boxes exploded rapidly one by one, starting with M7. This mass explosion is probably mainly due to the heavy class of the fireworks, in combination with the small dampening between the MAVO boxes. M7 probably contained fireworks of class 1.1. Its explosion had a TNT equivalent of circa 800 kg and was accompanied by a shock wave and a fire ball of 85 meters in diameter. Little more than a minute after the explosion of the MAVO boxes the final explosion took place, destroying bunker C11 and the rest of the bunker complex. The remaining containers exploded almost simultaneously. It is assumed that the ejected fireworks from the explosion of the MAVO boxes and/or the fireball initiated the explosion in C11. The doors of the bunkers had probably been destroyed by the previous explosion. The explosion of the other bunkers of the central storage was either initiated by ejected fireworks, or by the heat from the explosion in C11. The time interval between the explosions of the separate bunkers was so small that they were perceived as one. This final explosion had a TNT-equivalent of about 4 to 5 tonnes.","The company did not meet many of its legal obligations. The company stored more fireworks than it had obtained permits for, and the majority of these fireworks were of a much heavier class than was permitted. Fireworks were present in the repackaging area where the fire first started, in which area no fireworks were permitted to be present when no work was being performed, as was the case on May 13. The water-pipe lead-through between the repackaging area and the adjacent bunker C4 was of a nature which allowed fire to jump across. Two containers with no permits had been added in 1999, one of these two containers (E15) formed a side of the triangle in which fireworks ejected from the repackaging area and/or the adjacent bunker started a fire. That triangle was, due to the way in which this container had been positioned, nearly closed off and difficult to access. The part of the terrain in this triangle had not been kept sufficiently clean to prevent the fire from spreading.","Area concerned - Remarks: 
The surroundings of the
site were divided into two sections: the so-called inner ring counted
4163 inhabitants. The outer ring counted 5724 inhabitants.

People - Remarks: 18 people (among who 4 of the 24 firemen at he site) were killed instantly, 3 persons were reported missing. Five months later another victim died in hospital. It is assumed that the missing persons also died in the disaster. 947 people were registered as being injured, 527 of them were treated in hospital. Ecological harm - Remarks: Several hours after the explosion measurements of relevant substances (including asbestos) were started. Measurements were repeated over the following two weeks. The results show that the maximum daily intake for human exposure has not been exceeded for nearly every relevant dangerous substance in air. Health monitoring of victims and emergency personnel show no consistent elevation of dangerous substances in blood and urine samples. It is therefore assumed that environment and public health have not been endangered by exposure to dangerous substances after the explosion.
National heritage loss - Remarks: National Museum Twenthe was damaged.Material loss - Remarks: Total material costs are estimated to be at least 1.000.000.000 guilders. 1250 persons have lost their houses. A number of them also lost all of their possessions. About 10,000 people were forced to spend at least one night elsewhere.
Disruption of community life: Communication networks were overheated for several hours after the explosion. 400 houses are demolished or severely damaged. The community is
disrupted. It is assumable that heavy metals from the fireworks have
come into the environment.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","The on-site systems are not exactly known yet. External services: Rescue operations by firemen and other rescue services. The area was evacuated for 3 days, the area in the near surroundings is still evacuated. A team of specialists has come to the area to identify the deaths. From the very beginning of the rescue operations, German rescue services assisted the Dutch rescue services. An independent board for accident investigation is being formed to investigate the cause of the accident (they also take into account: legislation, governmental services, permits, regulatory bodies, emergency measures taken, audits, procedures etc.). Decontamination (asbestos, personal safety equipment). The municipality provided psychological help, financial support and new housing for the people.Emergency measures - Remarks: Around 15.00 reports of fire near the Grolsch brewery reached the police. At 15.03 the police arrived at the site, fire brigade followed at 15.08 and the first ambulance arrived at 15.16. By now a large crowd of spectators was assembling, attracted by the spectacle of the exploding fireworks. Police and ambulance personnel decided to keep the public at distance and, with some difficulty, managed to clear the Tollensstraat. Shortly afterwards, at 15.36 the final explosion took place. The fire brigade suffered heavy losses: 4 fire men were missing, several more were injured and all of their equipment was destroyed. As a result hardly any attempts to extinguish the fires were made during the first 40 minutes after the explosions. The many small fires in the area developed into an sea of fire. During the next hours contingency plans were set into action. Fire brigades and medical assistance were called in from other parts of the country and Germany. The last fires were put out on May 15, 02.00. Emergency facilities for the treatment of wounded and shelters for people who lost their houses were organised. The search and registration for missing persons was organised. Arrangements have been made to compensate the victims for their material losses. Psychological follow-up care is still being provided.Seveso II duties  - remarks: 
Written safety
regulations had been made available to all employees. These included a
smoking prohibition, regulations for wearing cotton clothing,
regulations for handling boxes of firework during loading and
unloading, check on the use of personal protection devices and the use
of fire extinguishers. Nearly all employees had followed specific
training for working with fireworks.
Official action taken - legal action: Public prosecution started a penal investigation.Official action taken - other official action: A special committee (Committee Oosting) has been installed to investigate the disaster. The committee presented its report on February 28, 2001.Assisted by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports (VWS) a Centre for Information and Advice (Informatie- en Adviescentrum) was set up shortly after the disaster, and measures have been taken concerning medical and psycho-social after-care. The Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment (VROM) was involved in soil decontamination, demolition of buildings and removal of asbestosThe Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (SZW) was involved in three financial emergency arrangements in the week after the disaster for occupants involved.The government gave an advance to the city Enschede to cover additional expenses. Also, funds have been added to the budgets of several departments (total amount DFL 92,1 million).Eight state inspections have conducted an investigation, final reports were presented on January 15, 2001.Four state inspections have conducted an investigation into the follow-up of the fireworks explosion in Culemborg in 1991. These reports were presented on February 19, 2001.In the third week of June, all mayors involved were informed of locations of munitions depots by the Ministry of Defence in consultation with VROM.On June 26, 2000, the Court of Mayor and Aldermen of Enschede have installed the Committee Financial Settlements (Commissie Financiële Afwikkeling). Arrangements for private persons and companies were presented in September and November 2000. VROM took the initiative to construct a directive on fireworks. The concept directive was published on February 26, 2001.On July 27, 2000 VROM presented an inventory of fireworks companies in The Netherlands Between July and October 2000, the external safety of munitions depots was inventoried by the Environmental Hygiene Inspection ","Measures to prevent recurrence: Next to the shortcomings of the company itself, the Committee Oosting reported a series of shortcomings in the government. These include not giving appropriate attention to the matter of external safety (at least where professional fireworks are concerned), not following up on lessons learned from an earlier fireworks explosion (Culemborg, 1991), inaccessibility of regulations and information on the subject, lack of communication between the official organisation and the politically responsible administrators and lack of supervision and enforcement. These issues have received a lot of political attention. Measures are planned concerning:-investigation into the disaster-state actions after the disaster-regulations on fireworks (both existing regulations and a new directive)-the permit policy -the external safety policyMeasures to mitigate consequences: Measures concerning (for details see references): -incorporating experiences in relevant documents (e.g. the National Handbook Crisis Decision Making (nationaal handboek crisisbesluitvorming))-the quality and supervision of preparing for disasters-intensifying the multi-disciplinary approach in disaster preparation-the co-ordination of combatting disasters and the National Support Facility Disaster Combatment (Landelijke Ondersteuningsfaciliteit Rampenbestrijding)-emergency rooms, communication and information provision-protection of environment and health|· information and advice centre (Informatie- en Adviescentrum)-psycho-social and medical after-care -financial arrangements-municipality disaster combat plans-co-ordination of investigations into disaster combatUseful References: Report of the Committee Investigation Fireworks Disaster ('Committee Oosting'), February 28, 2001; MAHB, Workshop on Pyrotechnic and Explosive Substances, March 28-29; Cabinet Standpoint Fireworks Disaster, March 23, 2001"

The following morning at 6:30 the driver was found dead. There were no eye witnesses, but it is assumed that the driver was killed because of breathing in turpentine vapours. The cleaning procedure was carried out with a water hose by opening the container´s manhole. The accident had no effects on the environment or property. ",The forensic investigation revealed that the driver had died of a heart attack. The probable cause was that the driver had breathed in harmful turpentine vapours. The risk of turpentine vapours was not fully realised before the accident even though a similar accident had happend only a few years earlier. The earlier accident had happend in a transport company's indoor washing facilities contrary to company's procedures and it was assumed that the death occured because of the washing being done inside. According to the procedure the tank wash of the raw turpentine residues had always to be done in the production site of the Arizona Chemical Oy. - The potential hazards of raw turpentine vapours were not identified.- The cleaning equipment was unsuitable for work.- No personal protection gear was worn.- Lack of proper operating procedures.- Lack of training.- Deficiencies in contractor (transport company) management.,The driver died.

643,73,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Explosion and fire of butyl acetate vapours during drum-filling,2015-07-16 11:30:00,2015-07-16 12:45:00,"At around 11.30 a.m., when a driver employed by an external company (providing transport services to the company on an exclusive basis since 1990) was filling a drum with butyl acetate – or more probably when the last remaining liquid in the pipeline was being fed in – vapours inside the drum ignited, causing them to explode. The bottom of the drum was blown off by the pressure that had built up due to deflagration inside, causing the liquid in the drum, which was by now in flames, to spill out violently, partly onto the ground and partly onto the driver, who was taken to hospital with burns on 80% of his body and died 15 days later. The resulting fire spread to only a minor extent because it was fuelled essentially only by the spilled liquid. The quantity of liquid involved is estimated to be essentially the content of the pipeline, from the auxiliary pump situated at pavilion&nbsp;D to the dispenser nozzle, i.e. a quantity corresponding to the final stage of drum-filling (feeding in the last remaining liquid). Given the dimensions of the pipeline (approx. 22 m long and 1 ½” in diameter), this quantity is around of 25 litres max., equal to 22&nbsp;kg. The explosion of the drum can probably be attributed to the flammable atmosphere that had developed inside it igniting; such a flammable atmosphere normally forms above the free surface of a flammable liquid such as normal butyl acetate (flash point +27&nbsp;C°), which was the product being transferred when the accident occurred. The fire was put out within a few minutes with the fixed extinguishing equipment located in the drum-filling building and through the use of outside hydrants by the internal emergency team. The local fire brigade was called and arrived quickly on the scene when the fire had already been put out. The fire brigade finished the emergency intervention and securing of the site within a few minutes and took instrument readings to check whether flammable substances were present in the atmosphere.","The local public prosecutor’s office initiated judicial proceedings to examine the causes of the event. In this context, an official technical expert was appointed and submitted a report. The expert’s report formulates the hypothesis, which the operator agreed with during the site inspection, that the flammable mixture ignited because of an electrostatic discharge caused by the earth clamp not being properly in contact with the drum. Indeed, as confirmed on site during the inspection, the clamp did not have an interlock system. Such a system allows product to be transferred into a drum only once earthing has been confirmed. In addition, the drum-filling area did not have any system for detecting potentially hazardous atmospheres. These issues were mentioned in the technical report dated 30&nbsp;October 2015, which was drawn up by the working group appointed by the control authority to check on the instructions issued following the examination of the 2011 Safety Report and to analyse the accident. The report indicated, among other things, that the Operating Instruction entitled “Critical area: filling drums with substances and mixtures using the auxiliary pump. Managing drum filling under normal, anomalous and emergency conditions: building A, zone D1, tanks 15 to 21” version 10/2014, drawn up by the company within its safety management system and examined by the working group, does not deal with the transfer of butyl acetate. The Operating Instruction also requires the use of an earth clamp but does not envisage a check that equipotential bonding has actually taken place. It also provides that drum-filling be halted in the event of an anomaly, with the definition of anomaly being given in general terms in a separate procedure. The accident probably happened when the last remaining liquid in the pipeline was being fed in, with vapours inside the drum igniting, causing the explosion. It is interesting to note that it is when the last acetate residues are being fed in that the risk is highest of an explosive atmosphere forming inside the drum above the free surface of the liquid phase, since the quantity of liquid being added is low. Under such conditions it is more likely that the flammable mixture will be within the flammable range. The details outlined above are confirmed in the official technical expert’s report.
Another matter to consider concerns the training of the victim: as stated by the operator and in the report, his job description as a driver did not include transferring products into drums (even though the worker was probably aware of the procedures for carrying out this operation, at least from having watched other staff do it). In addition, a further ‘aggravating’ factor in the accident that caused the death of the worker caught up in the explosion is that this death could probably have been avoided if the worker had been wearing all the personal protective equipment (overalls, helmet, etc.) required when filling drums, in particular fireproof antistatic overalls, which would have protected the area of his body that was most seriously burned by the flames. Indeed, the operator has stated that, when the explosion occurred, the deceased worker was wearing antistatic shoes and gloves but no overalls, helmet or goggles. Lastly, on the day of the accident, the fact that the worker was not using personal protective equipment was not noted/remarked upon either by colleagues who were involved in other transfer operations but did come into contact with him, or by management staff supervising operations and present that day in the offices.","Personal injury/death.
The event caused the death of the worker filling the drum. The fact that the vapours inside the drum ignited caused them to explode. The bottom of the drum was blown off by the pressure that had built up due to the deflagration inside, and the liquid in the drum, which was by now in flames, spilled out violently, partly onto the ground and partly onto the worker, who was burned on his face, torso, upper and lower limbs &ndash; a total of 80% of his body &ndash; sparing only his upper thorax, inner abdomen, hands and the soles of his feet (because of the protective gloves and shoes). The worker was immediately given first aid and taken to hospital, where he died of complications 15 days later (on 31 July 2015).Material damage.The fire spread to only a minor extent because it was fuelled essentially only by the spilled liquid. It caused limited damage to drum-filling station D1 inside building A. During the inspection committee&rsquo;s site inspection, station D1 still showed evident damage caused by direct flame exposure, both at ground level and on devices and equipment up to a height of around 6&nbsp;m above ground. As indicated in the official technical expert&rsquo;s document and declared by the operator:&nbsp;
all the components present were damaged: the roller conveyor delivering drums, the roller conveyor bringing drums to the scales, the button console, the scales, the local extractor fan and the dispenser nozzle. After the event, the dispenser nozzle used to fill the drum displayed signs of a blast;
the drum-filling pipeline near D1 and the roller conveyor delivering drums were also damaged to a lesser but still significant extent. In the surrounding area, five drums exploded and their bottoms and lids can be seen in the photos taken by the official technical expert. One of the exploded drums lost its bottom, whilst the lid, without the cap, remained attached. There were caps on the lids of all the other exploded drums. The vapour extractor was found burned and positioned above the drum. There was no evidence to state whether it had been turned on. The auxiliary pump was found switched on.&nbsp;
Overall, the damage observed can be attributed to the results of a pool fire resulting from the spillage onto the ground of a relatively minor quantity of flammable liquid and a number of deflagrations within some drums.","The extent of the fire was limited to the drum-filling area. It was thus put out within 15/20 minutes, with the internal emergency team working for 10 minutes and the fire brigade, which had been called out, working for another 5 minutes. The company deployed the manually operated fixed extinguishing system and used two hydrant-connected UNI45 hoses to put out the flames in station D1, one dry powder extinguisher for the flames engulfing the victim’s legs and a fire blanket on the victim. The emergency was managed by three members of the internal emergency team to put out the fire, two people to give the victim first aid and one person to communicate with outside bodies, the medical emergency services and fire brigade. No alarm was sounded to evacuate staff from the plant, because the evacuation alarm system was undergoing maintenance when the accident occurred. The outside bodies that intervened were: fire brigade teams from the local fire department with specialised NCBR (nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological) support, helicopter ambulance, police forces, local police, health and safety at work service and regional environmental protection agency.","The information gathered and the reconstruction and analysis of the event in question make it possible to identify certain critical points for improvement. These are directly linked to the causes and were also included amongst the instructions issued by the ‘Seveso’ control authorities and health authorities in relation to the accident:&nbsp;
the need for the operations prior to filling drums to include a check that the mobile container to be filled has been equipotentially bonded. When the result of this check is negative, it must not be possible for the filling pumps to be started up;there must be a ban on filling drums when the following conditions arise:

malfunctioning of the extractor fan serving the drum-filling area or failure to turn it on;
detection of flammable atmospheres in the drum-filling area, through installation of a system for detecting flammable vapours;
the mobile container has been filled to its maximum capacity for the substance in question;

the risk analysis must cover all possible accident types linked to drum-filling;the risk assessment document for explosions must be updated, ensuring that all items of equipment installed in explosion hazard areas are suitable for those areas based on the area classifications;the safety management system must be re-examined in terms of risk analysis, training of in‑house and outside personnel and operational supervision, particularly for the transfer of flammable liquids into mobile containers. In particular, the training of in-house personnel must be improved as regards the systematic use of the personal protective equipment for product transfer operations."

When the accident occurred, the installation was not classified as a Seveso plant: therefore, the accident was notified as an OECD database accident (Other Event).The accident has been classified as Level 2 of the severity scale (due to the number of injured persons).The accident is notified because the management of this type of situation (fire involving a storage of rubber or rubber products inside a building) provides many lessons: in relation to risk, but also to environmental pollution (water and air).","An external contractor company, which had a hot-work permit, was carrying out maintenance operations involving the installation-removal of metal elements, which in turn involved welding and cutting with a blowtorch. In all probability and subject to the conclusions of the judicial inquiry being carried out, the most plausible hypothesis seems to be that a small piece of molten metal ignited a slow combustion associated with pyrolysis of rubber which was stored nearby on palettes, a combustion which went on for an unknown period of time before the fire broke out.","Nine persons were injured: 6 members of the on-site fire-brigade and, 3 members of the off-site fire-brigades&nbsp; (including a bone fracture which occurred while removing equipment after the fire was extinguished).The accident was contained to building O 24, due to the successful measures adopted by the fire fighters&nbsp; to prevent the fire from spreading to nearby buildings (namely a laboratory, oil and storage warehouses, and an electric transformer unit).Property damage was extensive. Most part of the damaged building will have to be demolished. 1.415 tonnes of gum were affected by the fire. The only important machine present in the building, an automatic weight-dosing machine (MAC BU), separated from the fire by a wall, and the majority of the chemical products were protected by the firemen and not damaged. The economic consequences were relatively limited. Only the buffer stocks of raw materials and a large portion of building O24 were destroyed. No essential installation was affected. Technical unemployment was not&nbsp; considered and the MAC BU machine was rapidly placed back into service.From the beginning of the occurrence it was possible to state that, in all likelihood, the nature of the materials involved&nbsp; into the combustion process would present limited toxic hazards, although the size of the fire and the incomplete combustion would cause a spectacular smoke plume rich in unburned particles (soot).The fire department&nbsp; performed a few basic air quality tests, in the immediate proximity of the fire, without detecting toxic compounds. The ATMO network for the air quality monitoring of the Auvergne region did not detect any dramatic increases of air pollutants. The air quality remained below thresholds over the urban area. However, there were numerous requests for information. - The real-time measurements starting from January 21st, 2000, - the mobile laboratory of the ATMO network set-up along the axis followed by the smoke cloud, - and additional measurements, on dust and particle fallout, performed by an approved organisation over the following weeks,confirmed that at the highest pollution peak, the concentrations of dust in the ambient air, outside the smoke cloud, remained much below the average daily exposition threshold recommended by WHO.All measurements data gathered until now confirm that the cloud caused a few temporary increases of dust and sulphur dioxide concentrations. Particle fallout remained very localised. The values measured remained below concentrations which can occur during unfavourable meteorological conditions for the dispersion of urban pollutants- thermal inversion anticyclonic period #No major impact was measured during or after the fire (death to fish, plant life, etc.). Afterwards, large monitoring campaigns have been carried out in order to analyse and evaluate non visible effects. The results are detailed in the paragraph ""Actions taken"". Long and complex analyses were also carried out on the sediments.","After detection of the fire the on-site fire brigade made an initial attempt to extinguish the fire which was unsuccessful, the fire brigade of the nearby city alerted for support arrived rapidly. The off-site fire brigade requested reinforcement from other fire-brigades in neighbouring cities and departments (regions), once confronted with the rapid spread of the fire. A total of 500 firemen were involved in the emergency response operations with a peak of 130 firemen simultaneously.The favourable environmental conditions for the dispersion of the smoke cloud associated with the absence strong wind were favourable to the emergency response operations and have permitted to avoid spreading the fire to adjoining buildings. In fact an important assembling shop and a research laboratory adjoining the building are of a fundamental importance for the operation of the site and of the company.Large amounts of emulsifiers were needed for the fire fighting operations, in fact of 100.000 litres of used estimates that 90.000 m3 requisitioned i the Auvergne region 80.000 were used for the fire-fighting operations. An analysis of the amounts of water used estimates that 90.000 m3 of extinguishing water were used during operation to extinguish the fire, a third of which were used by the sprinkling systems.While during the fire and in the following weeks, attention in the press was primarily drawn on the large smoke cloud which could be observed during extinguishing operations, actions taken by the public authorities and DRIRE have taken all possible hazards into account as soon as the accident happened.It should be noted, however, that the facility does not present elements making any major hazard as likely&nbsp; (absence of a significant inventory of toxic products, easily flammable products or explosive substances, etc.).&nbsp;","With hindsight, knowing how difficult it is to extinguish a large rubber fire, it seems that the fire could have been controlled and extinguished much better, if the means of response, which were limited, had been faster..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time delay between the start of the fire and the decision to inundate (""deluge"") the storage facility appears to be rather long (1h20). The absence of automatic systems highlighted the fact that it was impossible to activate manually the relevant devices, as they were not accessible, being located in the immediate proximity of the flames rather than outside the building. Wherever the sprinkling valves could be activated quickly, the stocks were protected and the fire prevented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Particular attention should be given to hazardous substances (distribution, storage and traceability), to the capacity for quick and automatic response in case of an accident, to the creation of emulsifier stocks (sufficient quantities), to the preparation of retention ponds which are adequately sized for the extinguishing water in case of a fire.Although the incapacity to retain the extinguishing water appears to have had no consequences, it has become the subject of intense considerations which aim to find solutions that can be applied also to all other establishments of the same type.Moreover, in the light of the results of the technical inquiry being carried out in relation to the accident, corrective measures have been prescribed. Generally speaking, a risk assessment and an evaluation of the prevention measures have been undertaken (updating of the hazard studies, consideration of possible domino effects, possible third party expert evaluations)."

The Internal Emergency Plan (IEP) was triggered immediately and, in line with it, the authorities were notified of what had occurred. The steel structures in the vacuum residue conversion facility were caught up in the fire. The firefighting equipment and vehicles at the refinery were used to fight the fire and bring it under control.","The accident is presumed to have been caused by a mechanical failure of the system for regulating a secondary supply line providing the reactor with hydrogen. The rupture caused a hydrogen leak and thus a jet fire (at an elevation of about 8 m from ground level) that affected other components and equipment.The assessments carried out showed that the rupture occurred close to a valve in the hydrogen pipe with clamp connectors, in the vicinity of the reactors. The causes of the rupture were identified as being the result of anomalous operation of the facility due to reduced/non-existent hydrogen flow that led to cooling by natural convection and consequent thermal stress. The loss of flow in the pipe occurred because of a compressor becoming blocked and a second compressor reducing to minimal flow.The fire then caused some other components in the facility to rupture, leading to a partial release of hydrocarbons. This was also the result of the malfunctioning of a cut-off valve when operated manually, probably because of a power cut owing to the power supply panel being affected by the fire.There was also a fire near the air coolers that broke out when the facility was depressurised rapidly because of stresses in excess of those designed for.","The facility suffered such major damage that it had to be rebuilt. There is no record of the event having consequences for human health, the environment or non-company property. The data recorded by the air quality monitoring network did not reveal significant increases in the concentration of the pollutants measured.","At 3:40 p.m. a worker on the spot noticed a leak in the structure behind the reactor and reported it to the control room. The operational staff who went to the location found white smoke leaking from the hydrogen supply line followed by the outbreak of a fire with a light-coloured, horizontal flame. The alarm was raised and the order given for the unit to be rapidly depressurised and cut off. The firefighting team attended an air cooler where a fire was clearly breaking out and in the vicinity of the reactor using the necessary firefighting vehicles and equipment to contain the incipient fire and cool the surrounding metal structures. The fire brigade was called at 4:05 p.m. once it had become clear how serious the situation was. When the firefighters arrived, they continued the containment and cooling activities with the help of refinery personnel. Operations continued through the night until 7:50 a.m. on 2 December, with cooling and control activities going on until the afternoon of 2 December. As per the IEP, the local authorities were kept constantly abreast of how the accident was developing, both by the company and by fire brigade representatives present on site. Based on how the situation developed, the local authorities did not deem it necessary to trigger the External Emergency Plan (EEP).","After the accident, the operator provided the relevant technical authorities with the plan for rebuilding the facilities affected by the events, indicating the improvements that had been identified following an analysis of the operational experience and the additional preventive and protective measures aimed at avoiding any repeat. Following the analysis of the causes of the accident, the measures proposed concern both redesigning parts of the facilities and implementing additional management measures to monitor critical equipment."

A minor leak had been detected in a flange on the piping of the ammonia synthesis loop.The company called a specialized external contractor to perform an on-stream repair of the valve, selected both for the limited extents of the leakage and the economic costs and efforts associated to a shut-down of a very complex system. The on-stream repair consisted in (see the drawing attached to the Original Report):
- fabrication of a special bracket in two parts adapted to the dimensions of the flange of the valve;
- injection of filling material in the bracket around the flange (the material had to be injected at a pressure higher than the operating pressure inside the pipe).
During the repair some stud bolts broke causing the escape of a jet of a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen at 250 bars. The escaping mixture exploded, killing 2 workers.","CAUSES:
Investigation revealed that two causes have probably contributed to the accident:
1- the flange stud-bolts of the valve have been replaced by others made of a material not equivalent to the one originally specified;
2- the maintenance company performing the repair have not taken into account the overpressure on the stud-bolts due to the injection of the filling material in the bracket.",EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:2 workers were killed by the explosion.MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion damaged the valves and the pipings of the plant. No data are available about the cost of the damages. A prolonged shut-down of the plant was necessary.Affected Area: installation,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:After the explosion, the ammonia production unit was shut-down. No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
- compilation of written maintenance procedures with emphasis on safety issues;
- establishment of the sequence of operations to be followed during repair of such valves."
649,978,Major Accident,"Fuel storage (including heating, retail sale, etc.)",Release of liquid hydrocarbons from an oil depot in Villasanta (Monza province –Lombardia Region-Northern Italy) with environmental consequences in the rivers Po and Lambro,2010-02-23 00:00:00,2010-03-09 00:00:00,"The event took place in different stages since the early morning hours of February 23, 2010 within the depot of mineral oil and consisted of the spill, caused by an intentional action, of about 2,600 tons of hydrocarbons (Diesel fuel and Heavy fuel oil) from the pipes of the loading docks of the plant and in the repayment of the product. From here, after reaching the treatment plant of the nearby town through the main sewer, the product has been poured into the nearby Lambro river, causing contamination of the river downstream of the filter, with involvement of a second river, Po, in the stretch downstream from the mouth of the first river, the second river delta and the coastal area of the sea were affected by the waters of the second river. ","The hydrocarbons release occurred at n. 3 loading arms located on either loading docks existing respectively for diesel and heavy fuel oil and directly connected with N. 4 tanks in the fuel depot. -the spill has been poured out on the square of the load; -the substance overfilled the tanks of the API separator tank coming indirectly from the sewage system inside the plant and directly passed to curb protection likely due to saturation of the sewer system itself (part of it is also poured into the basins to contain fuel oil tanks). -the substance was drained from the API tank through the main valve, always kept open to allow the discharge of waste water from an hydraulic barrier aimed to remediation, to the sewer outside the plant, which flows into the main collector and from there to the treatment plant of the nearby city and finally into the nearby river.","Off-Site Water bodies affected by the oil spill are the nearby river downstream of treatment plant of the town,the second river from the mouth of the first nearby river to the lagoons of the delta and coastal marine waters in front of the zone directly influenced by waters of the second river.In the emergency phase the quantity of the mixture of hydrocarbons (oil / fuel oil) being present in these water bodies, and their impact on water quality have been different, particularly severe on the first river and to a lesser extent in the second river and progressive decreasing to the sea,due to the dilution effect caused by the various tributaries of the second river's valley to the mouth of nearby river and the heavy rains. The emergency allowed the recovery of a quantity of product upstream of the sewage treatment equal to- 1250 tons retrieved at the treatment plant of the town - 300 tons recovered in the yards of Oil Depot for a total of about 1550 tons of product. Of the remaining 1050 tonnes of oil released into the nearby river downstream of the treatment plant of the town have been recovered: - 100 tons by means curtains made in the rivers - 450 tons at the dam on the second river for a total of about 550 tons of recovered product. Therefore about 500 tons are scattered along the rivers between the treatment plant of the town and the sea with a total length of river courses involved more than 300 Km. The extensive data collected show that the immediate consequences of the spill occurred at the superficial part of rivers consist mainly in a ""black wave"" of hydrocarbons that has passed between 23 and 28 February 2010. Along the stretch of the nearby river downstream of the treatment plant of the town to the confluence with the second river a WWF protected area and some urban parks in other nearby towns were involved. Downstream from the mouth of the first river along the shaft of second river are present n. 27 ZPS-SIC bordering sites designated and protected under the ""Habitats"" Directive 92/43/EEC and ""Birds"" Directive 79/409/EEC (recently revised by Directive 2009/147/EC). In a short time n.10 specimens belonging to two different species (cormorant and mallard) recovered in the hours following the event were died. From the findings identified by postmortem examinations apparent cause of death is poisoning not only by ingestion of hydrocarbons but also by transcutaneous absorption or inhalation. At the moment, an estimate of the animals killed by substances leaking is difficult, because many specimens of birds have been poisoned to death in remote and secluded areas. A comprehensive estimate of the damages is also difficult for the aquatic plant and animal communities that inhabit the ecosystems involved. Currently it is not possible to determine with certainty the actual amount of permanent or long-term damages to the various habitats caused by oil transit along the river courses and not intercepted by the actions of emergency put in place. Monitoring studies are being carried out under EC Directive 2000/60 involving different technical bodies both at central level and locally, with the goal of assessing the extent and impact caused by the discharge of hydrocarbons on the various environmental media (water, sediment, aquatic plant and animal communities). Only at the end of the monitoring activity it will be possible to obtain a complete picture of the actual extent of the damage, taking also into account the potential impact of the event on other water bodies and protected areas linked to the area directly affected by the oil spill. On-site The area affected by the event of release is located inside the industrial site and it is extended about 19,000 square meters. The first area of intervention has involved about 5000 square meters of land in front of the loading docks. First emergency activities have led to the production of solid waste due to the shelling of the land and the use of oil-absorbent material as well as aspiration of liquid waste from square, the API tank and the removal of the contaminated fluids derived from the decontamination of infrastructure in the depot. The solid waste has been stored in the establishment and partly disposed of by means of roll-off boxes and semi-ponds. The total quantity of soil/solid waste product is approximately 1700 tons for a fraction of oil products of 18 tons (identified on the basis of measured concentrations from the analysis of land). The liquid waste has been stored in tanks inside the plant provided by the Company. The amount of liquid waste was: 1060 tons of product hydrocarbon emulsions 569 tons of contaminated water 54 mc of sludge contaminated with hydrocarbons","On site On the first emergency phase corporate officers carried out the shutdown of the pumps, interruption of electricity and the interception of the spill by closing tanks and loading docks manual valves.Subsequently, in response to the presence of large quantities of oil that poured from the square load, directly or through the sewage system in the API separator pool, were activated fire protection systems (water cannons) to keep the product floating (above the ground). Then, according to the reconstruction made by the holders, the staff took steps to stop the flow of water from the wells of the hydraulic barrier (set up for reclamation of the site) to the API separator pool. At the same time the company contracted to perform emergency operations was immediately alerted in order to remove the product from the square load and the APIpool. Later, at about 9:00 am, technicians of the company that operates the sewage treatment plant of the city arrived at the factory to inquire about the registration of the anomalous presence of hydrocarbons at the inlet of its wastewater treatment plant. After having assessed the situation, the staff had taken steps to close (with difficulty) the valve located downstream of the pool API directly leading to the sewer outside the plant and connected to the sewage treatment plant itself. By the information transmitted to the central authorities by the local Fire Brigade, the request for assistance to the firemen at the Oil Depot was received at 10:59 on February 23, 2010 in relation to difficulties encountered in closing the valve from the tank API that connects the sewer to the main collector and from here at the treatment plant of the city.In this regard it should be noted that the emergency procedures of the establishment provide an immediate calling of the fire brigade in case of uncontrollable events within the plant. Off-Site Several containment actions have been put in place along the first river, downstream of treatment plant of city, and along the second river downstream of the confluence with the first river as a result of activation of the emergency occurred at approximately 8:00 am . The treatment plant of the city acted as physical barrier to contain part of the products along the first river. In addition to it the garrison prepared to contain products in corrispondence of an hydroelectric power plant river dam along the second river made it possible to mitigate the effects by limiting quantities of hydrocarbons released in the second river and protecting downstream uses in place of drinking water supply and irrigation, aquaculture and fish farming in the second river delta and the nearby sea. At the treatment plant of the city were recovered (by means auto drain) and disposed about 2,638 tons of oil/water emulsion (data up to March 2, 2010) with an average of 47%of hydrocarbons. At the power plant river dam were recovered most of the quantities of product not retained by the wastewater treatment plant and from the oil barriers played on the first river. The action of containment was achieved by raising the gates of the dam in order to facilitate the flow of water at the bottom and the containment of hydrocarbons on the surface. The product, consisting of a very viscous oil/water emulsion, was recovered using firstly oil skimmers. The process, due to the accumulation of plant debris that did not allow the proper functioning of the equipment, was secondarily guaranteed by means bucket load on a recovery barge. To facilitate the containment and recovery of hydrocarbons at the river dam, actions has been taken to facilitate the accumulation of the floating products on the right side of the river. With regard to actions aimed to wildlife preservation, action was done to removal of the birds in wildlife reserves by means helicopter flybys.","Notwithstanding the existence of intentional action as a primary cause of occurrence of the issue is clear, however, the absence/lack of technical systems and security management procedures that would normally be allowed to mitigate the consequences of the release: Absence of automatic systems for high / low alarm level on the tanks or automatic locking systems to serve the loading docks and / or its pumping equipment or systems for automatic optical or audible on the equipment (under a remote control) such as pumps for the transportation of hydrocarbons. Insufficient and / or failure to adopt appropriate anti-intrusion alarm systems in addition to the service provided guard designed to prevent acts of tampering or theft within the store or to allow the immediate activation of the actions of an emergency out of the regular time of opening. Insufficient and / or failure to adopt appropriate procedures for identifying and mitigating risks connected with the environmental consequences such as the closing of the valve located immediately downstream of the tank API in the presence of hydrocarbons. Insufficient and / or non-application of procedures for manual shut-down system maintenance especially in relation to the difficulties encountered in closing the valve downstream of the pool API separator. Failure implementation of emergency procedures which provide, in case of critical situations / uncontrolled activation of the immediate call to the fire station."

While the control room, high pressure pump and electric motor drive unit are located in separate containers, the cutting facility and water treatment facility are located in a building (tent) approximately 80 m away.The solid fuel consists mainly of ammonium perchlorate (69%), aluminium powder (18%) and additional substances (13%), including hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) (9%).
Once washed out, the solid fuel is separated by a lock system and a conveyor and then manually placed in containers.The water used to wash out the solid propellant is collected and mechanically processed in, inter alia, a tilted plate interceptor, a metal-edge filter, a candle filter and three storage tanks. It remains in the process circuit and is returned to a high pressure pump via another container.

MAIN FACTORS WITH DESIGNATION OF SEQUENCEtechnical defect in the process,loss of control over the external cause processfailure to supply cooling water,organizationALhuman factoroperator error - unconscious neglectThe direct cause of the propylene leak was a loose flange connection at the inlet of the safety valve located on the pipeline bridge.The main cause of loose flange joints between the safety valve and its shut-off valve was the excessive and devastating vibrations caused by the turbulence of the safety valve. The main cause of excessive and destructive vibration was most likely resonance induced by the acoustic standing wave on valve discharge and natural frequency. The calculations show the resonance with the outlet pipe. While other factors may have a causal effect on the occurrence of chatter (eg low flow) and subsequent vibrations (eg pipeline support project), the massive vibration intensity with such a devastating force, as evidenced by the extent of damage to the safety valve, could only be attributed phenomenon such as acoustic resonance.

The main cause of the furnace fire was the crack on the sixth hairpin, which was not properly cooled by process steam. Following a crack on the filament, a hydrocarbon flashing occurred in the reaction section and in the hot section and then the flare of the hydrocarbons in the conventional section and the spray line, and finally the washing oil flare as the furnace separated from the hot section to ensure that the hot section was secured before the next fire of the other portions of the ethylene unit .The main cause of improper cooling of the furnaces after emergency shutdown was the loss of process steam when two high-pressure steam boilers for the ethylene unit were dismantled and at the same time lost the steam import for the furnaces after heavy explosive burns caused by the tearing of the medium pressure steam pipe into the pipeline bridge .","The consequences of a major accident did not cause and did not appear outside the company's premises.

He was brought out after 1/2 hour by the fire brigade.The explosion was heard in the neighbourhood and was followed by a fire in the pit, in the hopper and in the areas of the tower and the gallery above the cells.The hot gases and/or incandescent particles ignited the dust deposits in the air circulation system of the cylindrical silos located a few meters away but a few meters above the horizontal silos. The fire fighters were alerted by the smoke plumes and intervened rapidly to fight the fire, thus avoiding the propagation of the fire to the vertical cylindrical storage cells.The explosion blew over half the roofing of the structure away and tore the walls of the tower open. Pieces of fibro-cement roofing panels were found at 30 m distance and several metal rods of the staircase giving access to the vertical silos were severed.The descending duct of the bucket conveyor employed for the silage of the press cakes was ripped open over a length of 4 m at the bottom of the pit section as well as at 2/3 height of the tower.","The accident originated from infringing the basic prevention rules for grain storage installations.Cleaning operations of the premises had not been performed. Large quantities of grain and dust accumulated in the pits, on all surfaces, forming layers which in some places reached several dozens of centimetres.A maintenance operation involving metal welding and grinding was performed in a confined space, a fire permit was signed as a pure formality without performing any cleaning operation. The workers performed the operation on the delivery redler conveyor while the elevator bucket conveyor was operating. Inside the bucket conveyor the atmosphere was saturated with dust.The discharging operation of the truck was almost concluded and welding and grinding operations had been finished when the explosion occurred.Based on the analysis of the elements gathered on the accident site and tests performed, the competent authorities consider the following accident scenario as most probable:- Initially several metal particles deriving from the grinding operations were projected and fell * either on the bottom of the pit igniting one or more combustion spots .........* or in the chutes of the conveyor before coming into contact with the dusty atmosphere of the descending side of an elevator. Holes have been found in some junction boxes and switching boxes of the handling equipment which may have allowed such a pathway.- Following this* a primary explosion occurred in a descending duct of the elevator (conveyor) at the level of the handling tower pit;* the explosion in the elevator spread to the handling tower pit due to suspension of the dust present in the pit; * the rupture of the shell of the descending duct of the elevator in correspondence with the second level of the handling tower propagated the explosion throughout the entire tower.* at the same time the explosion in the pit affected the upper part of the tower through the openings* the explosion of the tower spread towards the rest of the storage and the roofing structure.The pit in which the explosion occurred is a strategic maintenance node were the feeding and extraction systems serving the entire silo system of the company are localised and are in communication.As far as the operator is concerned the most probable cause of the accident was a blocked rotating element of the elevator which may have caused the explosion by overheating.","Two workers performing maintenance operations in the pit of the handling tower were seriously injured, a third person the truck driver delivering rape-seed cakes was slightly affected. Material damage was considerable. ","An urgent prefectoral decree of 16th June 2001 by the Prefect of the Somme region ordered:- that the authorisation to resume the activity of the whole installation for receiving, handling, storing and transforming grains as well as animal feeds operated by the company be subject to: * proof by the operator of strict compliance with all relevant regulations * updating of the safety report of the site according to article 3 of the decree of 21 September 1977 * resuming the activities of the transfer chamber affected by the accident be subject to the delivery of the safety report in compliance with article 38 of the decree of 21 September 1977, specifying the precise conditions under which measures have been implemented to avoid the recurrence of such an accident.The company submitted a safety report on 28th June 2001 and subsequently documented the stages in the compliance of the installation. Operation of the maize silos and the brick silos was authorised progressively.","Onsite the following prevention measures were taken in relation to the pit affected by the accident- simplifying the communication node of the silos - installing a vent on top of the elevator covering all the duct surface and connected to the external atmosphere; the bottom part of the elevator is equipped with surfaces which can be cleaned with compressed air. - the concrete slab of the brick silos ground -floor (ceiling of the elevator pit) has been replaced by a metal structure - separating the reception pit from the silos underground gallery by installing a door - separating the handling tower from the upper cell sections by means of steel lining in order to reduce dust depositing in the tower and limit the propagation of a secondary explosion in case of accident. - creation of position of safety managerIn a wider context the accident occurred in a cereal storage installation which, after the accident at Blaye, had been subject to the intervention of the Classified Installation Inspectorate and to a series of administrative and criminal proceedings. These proved to be insufficient to oblige the operator to take the hazards of the activity correctly into account and to comply in the longer term with the safety regulations. This kind of installation needs permanent monitoring and maintenance of safety procedures.The Regional Inspectorate for Classified Installations (DRIRE) of the Piccardy region has set up an operation called ""Silos"", consisting in the systematic inspection of all registered silos subject to authorisation over a period of three months. The prefects and the representatives of the professional associations were given advance warning of this operation.Certain reactions opposing the implementation of certain clauses of the ministerial decree of 29th July 1998 were encountered in the first sites inspected. The collective awareness of the problem and of the need to handle the risk at its source however developed rapidly, thanks also to the psychological impact of the ALBET accident, which followed the accident at BLAYE, and to the collective, systematic and demonstrative character of the operation.This explains why at beginning of the operation the average number of non-conformities found during the inspections was 7 whereas it dropped to 4 in August for the last inspections.During this campaign a total of 100 silos with a capacity of more than 15 000 m3 were inspected&nbsp;- 93 reports were issued for 567 offences&nbsp;- 94 proposals were submitted to the prefects &nbsp;- the main non-conformities found were related to the detection of malfunctioning, to the electric systems and to the conveyor systems"

655,1287,Major Accident,"Processing of ferrous metals (foundries, smelting, etc.)",Release of blast furnace gas at a blast furnace,2021-07-08 20:30:00,2021-07-08 20:35:00,"On 8&nbsp;July 2021, between 20:22 and 20:35, a blow-through (the abrupt collapse of the ore and coke layers, resulting in gas flowing suddenly through the furnace atmosphere, increasing its pressure, towards the furnace head) occurred at blast furnace 2 (HO2).
As a result, the dip tube in the cyclone was damaged and deformed so badly that it prevented gas from passing from the cyclone to the scrubber.Consequently, there was a rise in pressure on the section between the furnace head and the inlet of the cyclone. At 20:32, as a result of the rise in pressure the HO2 safety valves (‘bleeders’) were opened hydraulically for 6 minutes. The incident ended with the initiation of an emergency stop of HO2.
The bleeders are located on a 86 m platform and are, according to the description in the blast furnace partial safety report, the safety devices provided which prevent and safely release an unacceptable overpressure in the blast furnace.
This measure resulted in an emission perceptible from outside the factory (discharge of dusty blast furnace gas with audible flow noise).
Safety functions:The scheduled safety functions were triggered correctly and caused pressure to be relieved by opening the pressure-relief valves (bleeders).","In order to determine the cause of the severe flow problems and the ensuing ‘blow-through’, all available data were evaluated:Several causes, which together resulted in the blow-through, had to be considered. The likely causes were an accumulation of minor furnace-cycle faults (e.g. accretions*) and changes to the charged feedstocks, which have a major impact on gas-flow behaviour in the blast furnace. These then led to the blow-through, which was remedied by means of the familiar method of compression.
The bleeders were opened because the damaged dip tube was blocking the outlet of the cyclone.The dip tube in the cyclone is likely to have been damaged by thermal overload and was so badly deformed that it prevented gas from passing from the cyclone to the scrubber. As a result, there was a rise in pressure on the section between the furnace head and the outlet of the cyclone.At 20:32, as a result of the rise in pressure, the blast furnace’s safety valves (‘bleeders’) were opened hydraulically for 6 minutes.The incident ended with the initiation of an emergency stop of the blast furnace owing to the sharp decrease in wind volume flow and the accompanying drop in counter-pressure.
The manufacturer of the cyclone was also asked to check, in particular, whether such incidents had already come to light.The manufacturer replied that this was not the case, with no previous reports of such disturbances.
*Burden materials which settle on the blast furnace’s wall (shaft, coal sack and bosh) from the effects of heat.","Assorted structural steel works on the cyclone after a technical inspection.
As a result of the rapid shutdown of blast furnace 2, the emergency stop resulted in the following unavoidable damage:All 42 tuy&egrave;res had to be opened as these were clogged with clinker. The 42 manifolds of blast furnace 2 had to be changed because they were similarly clogged. Of the 42 blast connections, 29 had to be opened and 9 of them changed.Damage to property: EUR&nbsp;500,000
Flow noise audible for approximately 6&nbsp;min.
Soiling of motor vehicles, cleaning costs.Damage to property: EUR&nbsp;500","The on-site fire service and relevant on-call teams were informed.A D2 alert was issued by the plant’s fire service and withdrawn at 21:10.Measurement of CO pollution at the factory by the works fire service and, in adjacent districts, by the Duisburg regular fire service. In each case, no concentrations of CO were detected.A press release was prepared.The competent district administration was immediately alerted by telephone, point of contact via the operator’s stand-by service.
Subsequent reports of soiling from falling dust were dealt with.No claims for damages to date.

During forthcoming outages (longer than 72&nbsp;h), additional cyclone inspections will be scheduled. It will also be examined whether this inspection can be carried out using drones in order to minimise the time-consuming preparations, e.g. degassing and ventilation, scaffolding.
Using the existing ‘cyclone gas inlet’ temperature measurement as an indicator of possible impending damage to the cyclone (and therefore also to the dip tube), and including it to monitor furnace operations, is still under examination.

The fire broke out in the pipe channel, located between a Combined plant (KP-6) and a container Finishing II. Immediately after the start of the fire, all units of Sisak Refinery plant were closed. According to the findings after the event, the cause of the fire was the leaking of gasoline that occurred during the handling of the container A-3, wherein the light petrol was stored as a raw material for the Isomerization Unit. Leakage occurred at the outlet from the tank A-3, in the vicinity of the tank, inside the tubular channel. The probable source of ignition was slight contact gasoline vapours with high-pressure steam line hot surface (80 bar, 500 degrees C), which also passes through the pipe channel. Field of two tubular channels, on both sides of the road no. 21, in&nbsp;a length of about 150 meters and 40 meters wide, was affected by a fire. During the analysis after the fire, it was found that the blind flange was not put back into place on a dead-end pipe of 250 mm diameter, and as a result, the contents of the container freely leaked out in the pipe channel.

In
the morning of September, 2004 a explosion was occurred in a compressor
operating panel in a P.P (Polypropylene) Plant, .
Two employees were killed on the spot, the panel was damaged itself. The
explosion was arisen due to high pressure hydrogen trespass through nitrogen
line for compressor panel purge. Nitrogen was supplied to purge compressor
suction part during the maintenance period and also to pressurize and hold
positive pressure compressor operating panel inside from the same header. And
when nitrogen valve was opened to purge compressor suction part to replace the compressor
inside valves, nitrogen valve connected to compressor operating panel was
closed by mistake. So compressor operating panel inside finally remained in
atmosphere and air entered in panel through openings. 



After
the replacement of compressor inside valves nitrogen purge line was not exactly
blocked. Between compressor suction part
and N2 header line two check valves and two gate valves and a globe valve and a
spectacle blind was installed but two check valves passed, two gate
valves(valve&nbsp; 1,2) opened, a globe valve
passed, a spectacle blind unused. And high pressure hydrogen trespassed
in the compressor operating panel through the nitrogen purge line according to
compressor running and the explosion finally occurred in panel by electric
sparks. 

","

Inadequate Design of Purge line:A spectacle blind was located in back of a check valve that is easy to be
passed, and purge gas for compressor operating panel purge was not instrument
air but nitrogen supplied from the same line that was used for the purge of
high pressure hydrogen parts. 

Inadequate Pre-start-up reviews:

Compressor
suction part all valves to be blocked was not closed and only a valve passed
was closed but pre-start-up reviews of purge line was not exactly performed.Inspection of valves not performed:Two check
valve and a globe valve passed but any inspection was not performed.



",Not provided,Not provided,"A spectacle
blind should be located in back of a block valve so that N2 purge line should
be blinded after the maintenance of compressor suction part, and purge gas to
hold positive pressure in an electric panel is recommended to change instrument
air instead of nitrogen gas.Pre-start-up
reviews should be exactly performed after any change."

A contracting company was working on the replacement of a 6’’ gate valve on a piping network at the Unit U-3300 (catalytic reforming of naphtha’s). The gate valve was placed at the battery limit of the reformer unit which connects U-3300 with a storage tank. After the removal of the existing valve, reformate naphtha started to flow from the one end of the open pipe. The amount of release was approximately 30 m3. A loss of containment (LOC) of reformate (gasoline component) during the replacement ignited a large-scale fire. The accidental release and subsequent fire of naphtha resulted in 4 fatalities and 2 Injuries.","Inadequate implementation of the work permit procedure and incomplete equipment isolation.

The plant was shut-down.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:High atmospheric pressure. Dead calm. Ambient temperature = -10°C.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The piping of an unused by-pass failed because of unforeseen ice formation in it as a result of water accumulation and low ambient temperature (-10°C). The released propylene created a gas cloud that was ignited 4 minutes later, causing un unconfined gas cloud explosion and a large fire. The overpressure generated by the deflagration caused the breakage of numerous windows panes inside the establishment. Damages to the buildings occurred but the main structures did not present any significant damage. Distillation columns located in the process area were strongly damaged by the fire. A distillation column (9m high) was broken and crashed with other nearby columns. The substances contained in vessels and pipelines were released resulting in a large fire that, one and a half hour later, was under control.

It was then decided to shut down the plant in a controlled way following the procedures described in the operating manual for losses of small scale, which required the shut-down of the burner in the near chamber (the involved chamber was kept running in order to burn the product escaping from the hole) and reducing the income flow to the minimum value.The situation in the combustion chamber worsened when two other tubes began to leak and the flame propagated externally up to a few meters outside the chamber.&nbsp; The plant was then rapidly shut-down and the emergency ended quickly with the burn-out of the flame in the internal of the chamber due to the consumption of the fuel, the use of a vapour jet, and the extinguishment of the external flame with the use of foam by the emergency intervention forces internal to the refinery.&nbsp; The incomplete combustion caused the release of a dense cloud composed by the combustion products from the chimney to about 500m in the west direction towards the first houses of the village of Rocca Priora.","The accident originated from the rupture of a tube, located about 3/4 of the height in the first pass in the combustion chamber (side ""Ancona""), and later involved other two tubes, one in the same chamber and another down in the convection chamber. In a first internal report of the company two hypothesis were put forward: either partial obstruction of the tube passage due to an anomalous detaching of the coke, which 
normally forms a layer inside the tube, or a defect of the material of the tube at the point of the rupture. From the successive analysis of temperature of the tube passages and the product flows, the technical note supports as the most plausible hypothesis the material defect of the tube which was the origin of the first loss, and which would not have been evident during the normal operation of the plant.
The hypotheses put forward on the accident causes (material defect or less probable, anomalous detachment of coke with partial obstruction of the tube) permit the following considerations. The ruptured tube was in the zone of maximum opening of the flame that is under greater thermal stress: this reinforces the hypothesis of the existence of a tube defect in this zone. As far as the possible coke detachment is concerned, the scientific literature says that in the visbreaking processes of the refineries there are undesired phenomena of asphaltenes precipitation due to incompatibility between the supply load and the derived products. These agglomeration phenomena are facilitated by the increase of the severity of the visbreaking process. It is important for this to better evaluate the chemical and physico-chemical characterisation of the fuel arriving in the refinery before processing it."," RELATED TO PERSONS:
The personnel present at the plant were a head of shift, 2 workers and 4 operators, of which none were injured as results from the internal report.
   RELATED TO MATERIAL:
The oven has been damaged in its interior due to the high temperature reached in the combustion chamber (about 1000 degrees Celsius and thus much higher than the design temperature of 495 degrees Celsius). About 100 tubes had to be replaced and it was necessary to revise the external control devices.

When the spare air fan was connected, the control valves opened, the lambda value of the combustion process no longer met&nbsp; the set values causing the automatic shut-down of the steam boiler. During start-up operations of the steam boiler a supply shortage of steam at 110 bar occurred causing the shut-down of one of the steam fed raw gas compressors. The excess steam had to be directed to a flare for approximately one hour.At 14:00 h the electricians requested the start-up of the repaired&nbsp; air fan motor for functional testing. The fact that the control valves of the fan were directly coupled to the rotational speed of the motor and not to the rotational speed of the fan was not taken into consideration This caused a recurrence of the situation that had occurred in the morning. Due to the fact that the steam boiler could not be started up in time the excess&nbsp; raw gas had to be directed again to the flare.Additional steam equipment operating on steam had to be shut-down in order to stabilise the high pressure steam supply situation, e.g. all steam fed boiler water pumps were shut-down. Out of 5 boiler water pumps only 2 pumps remained operative, which was sufficient for the existing loadAt 14:30 h in one of the boiler water pumps a 6 kV arc over occurred between power supply and pump motor, causing the failure of that pump.With only one pump functioning, the feed water supply of the last operating boiler was no longer guaranteed.The last steam generator was shut down when the signal ""feed water level to low"" was displayed. This led to the emergency shut-down of the last operating pyrolysis furnace; the shut down of the ground flare and the operation of the high-flare without steam injection. Operating the high-flare without steam significantly increased soot emissions with respect to normal operation. The high-flare was fed from then onwards with the evaporating refrigerants (ethylene, propylene) from the refrigeration circuits mixed with residual substances present in the refrigerated part of the ethylene plant.During a walk round the plant at approximately 17:30 the plant personnel noticed flames spreading from the furnace and alerted the on-site fire-brigade.","The furnace was operating under normal conditions when the plant was

The SCl2 hydrolysed upon contact with ambient humidity, causing an intensive emission of hydrogen chloride (HCl), which was not detected by the column's HCl gas detector (the threshold was at 25 ppm). A safety alarm installed in the facility went off at 13.12 (giving a reading of 105 ppm of HCl). The automated system shut down the facility and set off a local audible and visual alarm, while alarm warnings were appearing on the screens in the control room. The internal emergency plan was activated at 13.35, and the 35 employees were evacuated. The internal fire team, supported by 40 external fire fighters, equipped themselves with breathing apparatus and plugged the leak; the cloud of HCl was overcome using 4 lateral fire hose lines. The 120 m³ of water used was collected in a retention basin to be re-used in production. The internal emergency plan was lifted at 16.15. The next day, a specialised company pumped the 800 l (1200 kg) of spilled sulphur dichloride into the retention tank and then transferred to a storage vat. The HCl remained confined in the building. The retention basins were cleaned using a neutralising mixture (water + potassium carbonate), which was then pumped to the factory's treatment plant, where it was treated. A comparable accident took place at the site in 2006 (ARIA 31691).
The leak was caused by a mechanical rupture in the recirculating pump of a storage tank which had been filled 50 minutes earlier. This was aggravated by the non-closure of an automatic valve at the base of the tank, despite the fact that it had been activated, firstly by the safety controller when it was shut off, and then by the shut-off at the base of the tank at 13.30. A mechanical problem was the origin of the non-closure of the valve at the base of the tank; there had been difficulties closing this for the past 10 days. The authority for the inspection of classified installations notes that the pump's performance did not appear to be suited to its requirements, considering the large number of maintenance operations that it underwent prior to the accident. For his part, the operator countered that the pump's technology had functioned for more than 10 years without any signs of failure. In addition to having the pump and the valve assessed, the operator put the following measures in place:
- The faulty pump and the valve at the base of the tank were replaced, as was the latter's actuator;
- As a preventive measure, the weight indicators (weight sensors) of the damaged tank and that of the adjacent tank were replaced;
- The cell of the HCl gas detector for the column was replaced and calibrated, as the malfunctioning of the existing detector, which had been checked 5 and a half months prior to the accident (the manufacturer recommends that this be done every 3 to 4 months) had not been remedied by re-calibration;
- The valve at the base of each of the four SCl2 storage tanks was linked to the local HCl detection system;
- Manual valves used to isolate the recirculating pump were automated and linked to the emergency shut-off system;
- A drip tray was installed on the pump's leakage controller in order to prevent splashing from the retention tank.

Environmental consequences
No direct environmental consequences were recorded.

The accident, which occurred in an installation that had not been examined during the danger study, brought the following points to light: -the importance of detecting, controlling and assessing the consequences of changes in the nature of stabilisers and other additives added to dangerous raw materials (sulphur dichloride) by suppliers. These modifications may be a source of triggering events (crystallisation and clogging in this case) and increased risk; -Even if events that seem insignificant in the smoot
h running of the process such as the presence of glass debris from the lining of the distillation column coupled with the lack of a maintenance program on the production equipment (cleaning of the boiler) or safety equipment (clogging of the pressure sensor) do not directly lead to accidents, can have a considerable impact on the safety in downgraded modes; -a routine, unusual or exceptional maintenance operation (replacement of a pressure sensor) must be subject to a complete prior risk analysis, in order to avoid creating conditions which could lead to an accident or aggravate the initial consequences. In case of dangerous substances, these operations must be monitored and re-evaluated according to the hazards of the intervention; -the relative efficiency and the reliability of the procedures and more generally, organisational barriers (lock-out/lock-out removal); -a control system (steam valve) for a process can in no way be considered a safety system and cannot be retained as such. In particular, the production PLCs follow logic and criteria which the intervention teams are not fully aware of and which do not necessarily take the downgraded modes and lock-out situations into account. -the importance of installation design as early as the design phase (glass/metal interface); -the importance of risk analysis and failure modes, as well as technical and organisational barriers, with maximum details, for the various ""operating"" modes.

&nbsp;SIA’s Accident Investigation, icl. Recommendations 
//SIA= Safety Investigation Authority. In Finland the Safety Investigation Authority investigates all major accidents regardless of their nature as well as all aviation, maritime and rail accidents and their incidents
There were two major industrial fires in the Finnish region of Satakunta in late January 2017 and SIA investigated the accident together. Only one of them occured in Seveso site.&nbsp;Chapters 3 and 4 contains information about the Huntsman’s accident. Analysis, conclusions and recommendations are common to the two different industrial fires.

&nbsp;
The SIA's recommendations (The Safety Investigation Authority):
The Safety Investigation Authority made&nbsp;safety recommendations for the improvement of industrial fire safety and the prevention of similar accidents:
1. The&nbsp;SIA recommends that, together with the Rescue Department, the Ministry of the Interior ensures that, in their rescue planning, industrial premises prepare for fires identified as longer-lasting or more extensive, or other dangerous situations of this kind.
In their rescue plans, neither industrial plant had prepared for extensive, long-lasting incidents requiring special management measures, cooperation, a range of preparations and, for example, the arrangement of replacement personnel and maintenance.
2.&nbsp;The&nbsp;SIA recommends that the Rescue Departments’ partner network plans arrangements based on which the use of foam as an extinguishing agent is always fast and thorough, and ask the rescue departments to implement such arrangements.
Water is the primary extinguishing agent in rescue operations, but water is not very suitable for extinguishing burning liquids. Strong preparedness to use foam is required in such situations. The need to use foam should be identified as soon as possible and the foam should be fired quickly, based on a simple command.
3. The SIA also recommends that the Ministry of the Environment supplements the instructions included in the fire safety regulations for buildings, which stipulate that the principles of fire compartmentalisation also apply to external pipelines and other installations.
Plastic pipelines were running along the roof of the titanium dioxide plant and the fire spread rapidly along them. Burning plastic fell from the pipelines onto the roofing material, which caught fire.
&nbsp;

The Safety Investigation Authority also recommends that the Ministry of the Environment supplement the instructions included in the fire safety regulations for buildings, which stipulate that the principles of fire compartmentalisation also apply to external pipelines and other installations.

The released gas was ignited apparently by the hot carbon particles obtained by the decomposition of the ethylene. The ignition of the gas cloud resulted in an aerial explosion.

CAUSES:
The ethylene was released from the reactor and the supply lines as a result of an exothermic runaway decomposition. The released gas was ignited (apparently by the hot carbon particles obtained by the decomposition of the ethylene) because the automatic water quenching system operated but failed to prevent the aerial ignition. This was due to a quenching system design not appropriate.  The intervention of automatic isolation valves on the reactor were not fast enough to prevent more unused ethylene entering the reactor and therefore to feed the aerial explosion. Automatic dump valves on the feeding line operated 2 seconds to dump residual ethylene to atmosphere resulting also in feeding the aerial explosion.",MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion caused structural damages to the surrounding plants but no data are available about their cost.Affected Area: installation,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The water quenching system automatically operated but it failed to prevent the aerial ignition of the released gas. The intervention of automatic isolation valves on the reactor were not fast enough to prevent more unused ethylene entering the reactor and therefore to feed the aerial explosion. Automatic dump valves on the feeding line operated 2 seconds to dump residual ethylene to atmosphere resulting also in feeding the aerial explosion.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No on-site emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, it was decided to reposition the pilot tubes which detect the pressure rise and activate the quenching system in order to speed its response and, therefore, to avoid the ignition of the gas cloud by means of the hot carbon particles.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- to use new smart sensors to speed up the reactor isolation and, therefore, to reduce the amount of gas released;
2- to vent ethylene to a separate, contained system or increase considerably the delay before the automatic dumping of the lines contents."

Attempted manual activation of the system was unsuccessful because the wiring was destroyed in the fire. The water supply was challenged due to the need of cooling water for the emergency shut down of plants, the internal fire engine did not start due to a defect battery.","Many lessons learned, some of them are:

Unclear responsibilities regarding installation of new fire detectors
Insulated hot-oil pipes operating av 300 degrees Celsius can corrode even if that is believed not to be tha case. Routines for visual control under insulation are imortant.

678,629,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Leak of approx. 30.000 m3 of crude oil  released into the npaved retention basin ,2006-05-01 18:00:00,2006-05-05 19:00:00,"On 1/05/2006 at 18:00 a crude oil leak was detected in the bottom part of the shell of the floating roof tank T-3002.Approx. 30.000 m3 of crude oil corresponding to approx. 26.000 t were released into the unpaved&nbsp; retention basin of 130m x 108m = 14.042 m2 and with a equivalent volume capacity as the tank.The characteristics of the released product are: Bashrah type crude oil Physical-chemical characteristics:Density (15°C) 858 kg/m3Viscosity (20°C)&nbsp; 11cstFlash point: &lt;21°CComposition: H2S &lt;&nbsp; 0.001% weightComments: The accident has been classified as major accident in reason of the amount of product released
 &gt;5% quantity for category 08 - extremely flammable
 as defined at point 1 of legislative decree 334/99 and subsequent amendments 
- released amount approx. 26.000 t.
The event was triggered by the failure of tank T-3002 in correspondence of the lower  shell part of the same tank.Meteorological conditions - Remarks: the wind caused difficulties inside the retention basinto keep the surface of the spilled oil covered with foam Wind speed: 2.00,&nbsp; Wind direction: Est-Nord-Est, Temperature: 18.00
Discussion about Occurrence:At 18:00 hrs on 1/05/2006 alarm was triggered due to smell perception and to the tank level alarm triggered at a variation of &gt;5 cm in the transfer control room; the alarm was caused by a release of crude oil in the storage area south east of the establishment, controls established a relevant leakage of crude oil in the inferior part of the floating roof tank T-3002.The onsite emergency plan specific for the storage area of the installation was triggered. The other production units of the installation did not shut down,&nbsp; because general emergency was not declared, .The tank was insulated from the other systems of the installation by shutting down all electrical systems.The onsite fire brigade intervened, composed by two fire fighters and 1 company's employees (standard composition of the team during week ends) and was promptly integrated by other 8 trained workers.The plant operators provided to transfer of&nbsp; remaining product in the tank T-3002 into tanks T-3001 and T-3004 with fixed pumps. At the same time the onsite fire brigade started to spray foaming agentst inside of the containment basin with&nbsp; the onsite fire extinguishing equipment, such to cover constantly the surface of the still leaking product.At 18:00 hrs the company official in charge as onsite emergency manager&nbsp; informed the provincial command of the fire brigade in Taranto which intervened with own equipment.The transfer of the spilled&nbsp; oil, which was continuosly leaking from the tank,&nbsp; was pèerformed with of four mobile pumps, and was kept under constant control by the onsite fire brigade and the public fire brigade of Taranto. The public fire brigade of Taranto kept on spraying discontinuously the surface of the released product with foaming agents in order to maintain it constantly covered.Several teams of the public fire brigade intervened until 19:00 hrs of 05/05/2006 when the product released was completely pumped off from the containment basin.The large amount of spilled product caused difficulties in the product transfer process, due to the fact that the release rate of the spilling product was much higher than the capacity the fixed pumps, therefore the level of spilled products was increasing constantly.&nbsp;Maintaining a constant foam level on the spilled product, in order to avoid formation of explosive/flammabnle air/product mixtures, was very difficult due to the fact,&nbsp; that the basin surface was very large and that the leaking liquid was causing a strong turbulence associated with the wind. It was feared that the leaking product could overflow the dams o the containment basin (having an equivalent volume to the damaged tank) due to the amounts of foam sprayed on the crude oil surface.Two road tankers and 8 trailers of high and medium expanding foam were used.The provincial fire brigade intervened with 4 vehicles and 26 men. Vapour concentrations of the spilled oil were continuously monitored on top of the containment basin dam, during the transfer operation of the spilled crude oil&nbsp; The concentration levels determined during the monitoring variated&nbsp; from 4% to 14% of the lower flammability threshold limit.The railway lines Taranto - Bari, Taranto- Metaponto were closed down as a precautionary measure until 5:30 hrs. on 2/05/2006.The state road S.S 106 Ionica was closed and patrolled by police in the tract adjacent to the tank for a shorter period of time.The area affected by the spillage was put under continuous surveillance by the onsite fire fighting team and by the public fire brigade of Taranto. Several teams of the public fire brigade have been intervened until 19:00 hrs on 5/05/2006, when emptying operations of the containment basin terminated.The failure of tank T-3002 has caused the release of approx. 30.000 m3 of crude oil corresponding to approx. 26.000 t.At the date of this report the environmental impact on the soil of the containment basin has been analysed whereas soil&nbsp; remediation measures had were to be taken for the containment basin. ","The release occurred following the formation of a large fissure in the lower part of the tank shell of tank T3002.
It has not been excluded that the tank failure may have been caused by a structural failure of the tank base, although an  inspection on the verticality of the tank shell did not show any irregularity.
The cause of the tank failure is being investigated.
The root causes of the accident, i.e. the causes of the tank failure, as well as the organisational and management causes will be identified only after the internal inspection of the tank.","Release of 26,000 t of crude oil into the unpaved containment basin.
The onsite emergency response plan, specific for the tank storage area, was activated, the other units of the refinery maintained normal operation, because a general emergency had not been declared
After the spilled crude oil  had been completely pumped from the containment basin into neighbouring tanks, soil tests showed soil contamination with an average depth of 30 cm  and a maximum depth of 2 m, with a concentration of contaminants above permitted  threshold values .
As precautionary measure the train line Taranto - Bari  passing some 80m from the company's premises was closed until 5:30 on 2/05/2006.
Area concerned - Remarks:The occurrence has involved the tank T_3002 and the containment basin of approx 14.040 m2 surface.The tank is located in a storage park which is physically separated from the refinery's processing installations by the state road SS 106 Jonica.The processing installations were not affected by the occurrence and continued working.The emergency plan specific for the storage, handling and blending department was activated.Soil contamination has affected the area corresponding to the containment basin of tank T-3002.People - Remarks:The accident has caused no victims.The onsite population considered at risk includes exclusively the personnel of the onsite emergency response team and the personnel present in the specific area during the accident. The personnel present onsite during holydays consists in the average in 40 units.Ecological Harm - Remarks:The release of crude oil inside the containment basin has caused soil contamination in the basin. Sample probes have showed principally concentrations of heavy hydrocarbons (C&gt;12) and to an minor extends concentrations of light hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds (C&lt;12) above the contamination threshold limits. At a maximal depth of 2m.The stratigraphy of the soil in the basin has shown that at approx. 3 m depth starts a clay layer reaching 80 m depth (data extracted from the regional geologic map) which has a low permeability isolating thus the deep water bed from the superficial water bed which starts at 2,5 m from the surface.The piezometric probes have shown pollution levels in the superficial water bed above the threshold values defined by law but, according to the statements of the company, these values have not changed significantly with respect to the values encountered in the soil classification performed in 2004.The results of the soil classification have been used in the Environmental and -Health Risk Analysis which was performed and has shown an unacceptable risk at such concentration level and therefore the need of remediation measures. The company is waiting the validation by the Ministry of Environment&nbsp; of the results obtained in the Risk Analysis such to set up a remediation project. Meanwhile, due to the fact that that part of the contaminants in the contaminated soil are washed out by precipitation and thus reach the water shed, a permanent piezometric monitoring system of the water shed through a series of wells placed hydro-geologically upstream and downstream from the tank T-3002. In any case the watershed&nbsp; Remediation project for the entire refinery which has been authorised in 2004 foresaw the construction of a hydraulic barrier in correspondence of tank T-3002, which has been realised. The hydraulic barrier consists in a series of pozzi di emungimento (injection wells) from which the water from the superficial water shed&nbsp; can be pumped for treatment.Material Loss - Remarks:&nbsp;The company had following costs:- Emergency response action (rental of motorised pumps, medium and high expanding&nbsp; foaming agent and other consumables);- Temporary repair of the tank by constructing a retention wall of approx 2 m of steel reinforced concrete in correspondence to the leakage point.- The contaminated soil analysis and the Risk Analysis specific for the occurrenceThe numbers indicated comprise also the estimated cost for:Tank cleaning, opening, repair and retrofitting (installation of a double bottom)Contaminated soil remediation inside the retention basin.Community Disruption - Remarks:The railway lines Taranto - Bari and Taranto- Metaponto which pass respectively at 80 and 165m from the western limit of the retention basin, were closed down as a precautionary measure The state road S.S 106 Ionica was closed and patrolled by police in the tract adjacent to the tank for a shorter period of time.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of:       Ecological component: land (with known potential for long term ecological harm or preventing human access or activities) - Affected Yes","The tank was isolated.All electrical equipment was switched off.The product remaining in tank T-3002 was transferred in tanks T-3001 and T-3004 with fixed pumps.The crude oil was still spilling out from the tank, while the onsite fire brigade together with the public fire brigade from the Provincial Command of Taranto, alerted by the safety manager of the refinery, sprayed the surface of the spilled crude oil in the retention basin with foaming agents, using mobile fire extinguishing equipment, such to keep the oil surface covered with foam. The crude oil vapour/air concentrations were continuously monitored in correspondence of the top of the containment basin dam. The concentration levels determined during monitoring variated 4% to 14% of the lower flammability threshold limit.The railway lines Taranto - Bari,&nbsp; Taranto- Metaponto were cut as a precautionary measure until 5:30 hrs. on 2/05/2006.The state road S.S 106 Ionica was closed and patrolled by police in the tract adjacent to the tank for a shorter period of time.The area affected by the spillage was put under continuous surveillance by the onsite fire fighting team and by the public fire brigade of Taranto. Several teams of the public fire brigade intervened until 19:00 hrs on 5/05/2006, when emptying operation of the containment basin terminated.Emergency measures - Remarks: Following difficulties were encountered during the emergency response operation
- The  transfer of a large amount of product (approx 52.000 m3) from the damaged tank to tanks T-3001 and T-3004 caused difficulties in the  process, due to the fact that the release rate of the spilling product was much higher than the capacity the fixed pumps, 4 mobile pumps had to be rented
- Maintaining a constant foam level on the spilled product, in order to avoid formation of explosive/flammable air/product mixtures, was very difficult due to the fact that the basin surface was very large (approx: 14.000 m2 including the surface covered by the tank), and that the spilling liquid was causing a strong turbulence associated with the wind.
-  There was the risk that the spilling product could overflow the dams of the containment basin (having an equivalent volume to  the failed tank) due to the amounts of foam sprayed on the crude oil surface.
- During the entire operation he crude oil vapour/air concentrations were continuously monitored in correspondence of the top of the containment basin dam. The concentration levels determined during the monitoring ranged 4% to 14% of the lower flammability threshold limit.

Official action taken - legal action: The General Attorney's Office of Taranto has opened an  information procedure on a non criminal event. The General Attorney has not given not requested an official technical consultancy report.Official action taken - other official action: The company notified the accident in compliance with art 24 leg. Decree N.334/99 (article 14 of the Seveso Directive 96/82/CE) and communicated the contamination occurred in compliance to environmental legislation (legislative decree N. 152/2006);
and started the official procedures for executing the remediation operations with respect to the contaminated soil in the retention basin.
At present  (date of this report) following steps have been concluded:
- Classification of the contaminated soil in the retention basin 
- Environmental- and Health- Risk Analysis 
- The validation of the Environmental- and Health- Risk Analysis by the environmental Ministry is expected
Discussion about response: Immediate response
At the date of  the present report tank T-3002 had still not been inspected internally. Therefore the causes of the tank rupture, localized on the bottom section of the tank shell, cannot be determined.
Concerning the emergency response operation, both the onsite emergency plan and the offsite emergency plan were triggered permitting to avoid the evolution of the event into a worst case scenario.

Long term response
The company reserves the right to make any technical, organisational and management changes once the causes of the tank rupture is clearly established, after an internal inspection of the tank is performed, which at the actual state of the works is foreseen for June 2007.
Meanwhile the company:
- did not consider it necessary to change the existing tank inspection and control procedures
- has confirmed that double bottoms will be installed in the tanks according to the program which started in 2004 and is scheduled to end in 2010 
- The company has been intensifying the control on the work progress in the tank bottom exchange program such to assure the respect of the timing defined.
- The company has already started official procedures for organising the remediation operations comprising the opening, inspection, repair end refurbishment of the tank (double bottom), and has started the official procedure foreseen in legislative decree  Dlgs 152/2006 which will conclude with the remediation operations of the contaminated soil in the containment basin.
Seveso II Duties- Remarks:The Regional Technical Committee (CTR)&nbsp; has concluded his evaluation of the safety report 2005 in November 2006, prescribing following actions to be taken:- Installation of remote controls on the pumps and of the root valves of category A tanks (for liquids with flash point &lt;21°C),- Installation of fixed extinguishing foam sprayers in proximity of containment basins of Category A tanks.- For floating roof tanks installation of redundant breathing valves- Installation of&nbsp; valves at the end of&nbsp; the rainwater drainage pipes in the floating roofs of Category A tanks. The safety report foresaw the catastrophic rupture of a crude oil tank with estimated soil contamination levels&nbsp; higher than those effectively measured after the accident.","Measures to prevent recurrence: The company had already programmed to install double bottoms in all tanks of category A and tanks for the for the storage of gas oil, in compliance with standard API 650,&nbsp; and the Best Vailable Technology (BAT) of the sector, when the accident occurredThe&nbsp; tank bottom&nbsp; substitution program started in 2004 and is scheduled to terminate in 2010.Following the accident the company has been intensifying the control on the work progress in the tank bottom exchange program such to assure the respect of the timing defined.The company is evaluating the possibility to install double bottoms also in the combustible oil tanks.Moreover following the accident the structural conditions of 29 tanks were tested with acoustic emissions, but also in this case the operation was already planned.The company is waiting to determine the exact causes of the tank shell failure by an internal inspection of the tank, the company has not found elements to request a revision of the&nbsp; existing tank testing procedures.Measures to mitigate consequences: The company reserves right to adopt specific mitigation measures once the exact causes of the accident are determined."

Those circumstances led to the exotermic reaction between the sodium dichlorisocyanurate and the perfume.","Three injured workers had to be hospitalized. One of them for more than 24 hours.
Material damages in the facilities: Destruction of the mixer and its accesory elements.","Inside the facilities, an emergency stoppage of the equipment was performed, the alarms for the workers were activated and the&nbsp; company emergency teams were activated.
Concerning off-site external public servicies, ambulances were used to evacuate the injured, access control was established, public information was made through the emergency services and the acustic alarms corresponding to the emergency plans of the upper tier Seveso sites in the proximity. The already set sheltering, due to the covid-19 pandemic, was reinforced.
&nbsp;","In order to avoid similar situations, the procedures to determine the flash point of the raw materials used (specially during high production lapses) need to be improved. An improvement in personnel trainning is also essential.
To mitigate the consecuences of possible similar events, it would be important to have sand containers near the mixer and at the facilities entrance.
The efficiency of the public sheltering was proved during the event. This measure was already implemented as part of the covid19 pandemic countermeasures.

The effectiveness of the flushing was measured.Subsequently, on 14 October 2016, cutting and welding work was carried out at several places on the line.
Chronological sequence on 17 October 2016:
The extended-deadline authorisation slips were handed over to the operational staff of the external company in the measurement room. A pipe bridge foreman was present at the work site in the pipeline route before work began and supervised the start of the works.
At the work site, a 3&nbsp;mm hole was first made in the line with a hand drill in order to check that the line was clear and safe. Control measurements using a portable gas meter were carried out to ensure that no hydrocarbon or explosive atmosphere was present.
Several cuts were made and sections of pipe were removed.A localised fire broke out at around 11:20 for reasons as yet to be established.A very sooty flame could be seen.
The employees of the external company moved away from the danger area.The fire protection unit tried to extinguish the fire using hand-held fire extinguishers.
The fire brigade was alerted by the port’s control station at 11:21 and arrived a few minutes later.
Shortly after the fire brigade arrived, an explosion occurred. Based on what we know so far, this was caused by a catastrophic failure of the ethylene line.
The impact was amplified by a section of at least 30 metres in length being ripped from its moorings and dashed towards the quay, where the first emergency services on the scene had taken up position. As a result, the fire also spread to other parts of the pipeline network and to a ship moored on the quay.
Other lines exploded as a result of the large amount of heat generated by the underfire in the pipeline trench. This led to the release of other substances and mixtures of substances, which also ignited.
Other firefighting units were called to assist.
The fire was extinguished at around 21:30 thanks to the affected pipes being shut off and to further intensive fire-fighting work. After that time, no other incident-relevant events occurred.
Safety measures:
Authorisation slips, safety stations, fixed firefighting equipment, alarms, works fire brigade.","According to the results of the public prosecutor's investigations, the angle grinder cut not the propylene line to be repaired, but a neighbouring pipeline filled with a liquefied gas mixture (raffinate II). The liquefied gas mixture under pressure escaped through this cut and presumably ignited on the hot surface or sparks of the angle grinder. The burning liquid gas jet directly hit the adjacent ethylene pipeline, approximately 50&nbsp;cm away. The ethylene pipeline is operated at a pressure of approximately 90&nbsp;bar.
It is suspected that the direct application of heat to the ethylene pipeline led to a thermal decomposition of the ethylene, which ruptured the pipeline and caused burning ethylene to flow out. The other pipelines in the trench were then heated up and further mechanical damage to other pipelines occurred.","Damage to property within the site:Pipelines, pipeline bridges, tanker, cars, lorries, emergency vehicles, interruption to production. Environmental damage within the site:Floor in pipeline trench.Adverse effects off site:Reports of unusual smells by persons in the area surrounding the northern port.Other disruptions off site:Traffic jams on the motorway and on the site access roads, closure of various gates.","-&nbsp; Firefighting/rescue of people (works fire brigade, professional fire brigade),-&nbsp; Warning within the operating area, loudspeaker announcements in accordance with the warning and alarm plan,-&nbsp; Siren alert off site, alert and instructions concerning conduct via disaster alert apps (KAT Warn, NINA), media and authorities,-&nbsp; Cordoning off of a wide area,-&nbsp; Continuous measurements by the professional fire brigade, surrounding local authorities and the operator,-&nbsp; Operational measures: Halting of production flows in the danger area and monitoring of pressure ratios.

Replacement of the trench floor is planned following an investigation under soil protection law and the drawing up of a remediation plan together with the competent authorities.","A safety inspection of the part of the installation concerned was carried out by a notified expert in accordance with Section 29a of the Federal Immission Control Act. There are currently two partial reports on this subject, which include an assessment of the plant and sub-installations before the incident and a summary description and assessment of the safety management system of the operator of the Land port.&nbsp;
As the public prosecutor’s investigations and enquiries are still ongoing, the final expert report is still pending.&nbsp;
Shortcomings or failures that caused the accident and its effects could not be identified.&nbsp;
In his partial report, the expert proposed technical and organisational measures to further improve both the safety of the installation and the organisation, which are also being implemented:

Optimise the identification-marking method to reduce the risk of confusion when working on pipelines.
Use low-sparking tools to reduce the risk of ignition.
Fireproof coating and automatic pressure relief system of the newly built surface ethylene transmission line in order to reduce the risk of explosion in case of underfire.
Optimise the pressure relief system of the newly installed ethylene pipeline in order to reduce the quantities released in the event of leakage.
Installing fully-automatic early detection of heat in the pipeline trench to alert the on-site fire brigade more quickly.
Remotely-operated manual disconnection of all product-carrying pipelines in the trench with position feedback and ‘closed’ safety position of the fittings.

683,921,Major Accident,Other activity (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion of a tank following welding activities,2007-11-26 12:50:00,2007-11-26 13:00:00,"



During welding activities on a pipeline of a tank&nbsp;containing
potassium carbonate solution saturated with hydrogen sulfide an explosion occurred.
The contractors fell down from the tank. One died and the other one was seriously
injured. 



","

The major cause of the accident was an explosion in the tank which
occurred when flammable gas (hydrogen sulfide) inside the tank was ignited by
sparks (which got inside the tank through the open probe). The sparking occurred
due to welding activities above the tank. 

The other cause was that the contractor workers did not obey the safety
regulations:

Performing
     welding activities without a formal written permission for works with the use of
     open fire on the operating facility;Unsufficient training of contractors on the safety measures (they only had the initial training);Infringement
     of the procedures concerning maintenance works;

Additionally, it appeared that safety measures used for working on
elevated surfaces were not appropriate. 



","

The explosion broke off
the tank’s lid which leaned over. One worker was thrown by
the force of the explosion out of the tank’s tray, fell to the ground and died.
The second worker was thrown off but he fell between technical pipelines and
was seriously injured. 

The employees involved in
the accident worked for a company which performed contract renovation works. 



","

The following immediate measures were taken:

protection of the place of accident and establishing no admittance
zone in the place where accident occurred;medical treatment to to injured.

","

In order to prevent such accidents in the future the following measures were taken:Compulsory elaboration of instructions for renovation works on operating
facilities and installations performed by contractor workers;Periodic inspections of the documentation of building/construction works;Assureness of direct compliance with safety regulations and renovation procedures;

The accident was discussed and analysed with the employees.

685,343,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Unexpected release of Lithium  from the cleaning valve resulting from a manipulation error,1992-04-08 23:00:00,1992-04-08 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The reactor B-6706 was filled with about 1,200 litres of diethylether. 800 litres of diethyl ether with 75 kg of dispersed metallic lithium would then be added from dispersion tank B-6716 and the reaction should be started with addition of methyl chloride. On the day of the accident the dispersion feeding pipe was blocked by solidified lithium metal. To unblock the pipe, a wooden stick was used to push (to avoid sparks and any damage to the reactor's enamel). After removal of a blind flange, the valve on the cleaning nipple was filled with paraffin (prior the reactor and the connected piping were depressurized). The wooden stick used for pushing was wrapped with a piece of cloth soaked in paraffin and the piece of cloth was put over the opened valve in such a way that the reactor should be protected against air entry. As the blockage was unusually solid, it could not be removed by pushing. During the attempt to remove the solidified lithium, the lithium dispersion was released through the ring slot between the wooden stick and the cleaning valve and seeped under the paraffinated piece of cloth on the reactor and ignited spontaneously. The worker on the operation platform above the reactor was burned on nose and neck by the jet-fire; the worker in front of the reactor was not hurt. Both workers run quickly to the control room and activated the alarm as they were not able to avoid the spreading fire on a second platform. The first fire was fed by the continuing release of lithium/diehtylether dispersion (it has been estimated that about 700 litres of lithium/diethylether were released). Due to the strong evolution of heat, synthetic materials caught fire: cables, lamp covers, a light globe and finally the tar board cover of the beton roof. The sudden unexpected release of the lithium dispersion from the cleaning valve can be explained as a manipulation error. The inlet valve in the reactor as well as the lateral outlet valve from the dispersion tank were not closed from the beginning of this otherwise routine executed cleaning operation. As the wooden stick was in the cleaning valve it was impossible to close this valve.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:During the attempt to remove a plug of solidified metallic lithium in the feeding line to the reactor, the lithium dispersion in diethyl ether was released and ignited spontaneously.CAUSES:The accident was caused by an operator error during the attempt to remove the plug: the inlet valve in the reactor as well as the lateral outlet valve from the dispersion tank were not closed from the beginning of this otherwise routine executed cleaning operation. As the wooden stick was in the cleaning valve it was impossible to close this valve.",EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 1 person was injured by fire.MATERIAL LOSS:The fire caused damage to the installation.

687,619,Major Accident,Other activity (not otherwise specified int the list),Four explosions in a gunpowder and hunting cartridges factory,2002-07-28 09:11:00,2002-07-28 11:00:00,"On July 28 at 9.00 a.m. there were 4 explosions (2 - 3 seconds from each one). The explosions destroyed&nbsp; two dryers, a building for the weighing and dosage of the crude substances utilised for the production of cartridges powders and a reinforced concrete building (unused since the last world war waiting for demolition).In the weighing room (22 F and G) some polyethylene tanks caught fire but this was limited only to that room","To verify the probable causes the competent authority sequestrated the plant, beginning an investigation and nominating a CTU expert.Actually it is impossible to give any precise information regarding the event as the outcome of the inspection is not yet public.However the establishment gave some detailed evaluation through the Delegate Councilor, see Full Report A Occurrence Point 5. To individuate the probable causes the competent judgemental authority sequestrated the plant, to begin a series of technical examination and verification.The establishment prepared an accident reconstruction as the magistrature did not end its investigation, on the basis of its study and the judgements of an International Technical Committee (called by the AFEMS (Associazione Fabbricanti Europei Munizioni Sportive, European playful munition manufacturer association).We need some introduction deduced by the declaration of the establishment to understand their hypothesis:""The establishment produces hunting cartridges, for smooth tube rifle, and powders for this kind of cartridges composed by the 90% of cellulose nitrate, 9% of nitroglycerin and 1% of diphenylamine as stabilizer.Powder is produced mixing the synthesis cellulose nitrate with biscuit, with recovery powder from the discharge of military munitions and recovery hunting powders from production discards, with solvents composed by diphenylamine, combining everything in the paste mixers. Before use the obtained product is subjected to further procedures. The cartridge case are produced by a specific hot procedure of the plastic, the cartridges are prepared in specific rooms with special automatic cycle machines.The water from raw materials used for the powders production is eliminated using the dryers, before their mixing.The establishment is constituted by many infrastructures placed in a quadrangular area with a dimension of 700 x 700 Mt, delimitated by a double perimetric enclosure (the internal one has antintrusion sensors)"".As regards the accident, "" we underline that the explosions occurred in the following infrastructures: - the dryer n° 41, where the hunting powders, the recovery powder from the discharge of military munitions and the cellulose nitrate were dehumidified;- the dryer 21N for the cellulose nitrate dehumidification;- the weighing and dosage building (35A) of the raw materials used for the powders production, where arrived the dried substances ready to be mixed;- the bunker complex (10C), totally abandoned;- the weighing and storage building (22F/G) of hunting powders.The explosions caused:"" - in the unit 10C a crater with the complete destruction of the towering structures. The crater has a diameter of about 9 meters with round borders and sweet curving. This kind of characteristic means that the explosive substance that caused it was a type at a low speed of explosion, a deflagrating one, like a propellant for rockets (military type) that explodes in the floor in a limited environment;- in the dryer 41 there were 560 Kg of cellulose nitrate, 800/900 Kg of hunting powder , both in the drying phase, and 180 Kg of cellulose nitrate completely dry, the accident destroyed the building creating two craters, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate them;- in the dryer 21N there were 1440 Kg of cellulose nitrate in the drying phase, the accident destroyed the building creating three little craters, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate them;- in the weighing and dosage building 35A there were 1600/1700 Kg of recovery powder and cellulose nitrate, 800/900 Kg of hunting powder , both in the drying phase, and 180 Kg of cellulose nitrate completely dry, the accident destroyed the building creating a crater with a diameter of 10 meters and 3 meters of depth, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate it;- in the building 22F/G 41 there were 3000 Kg of hunting powder in boxes of antistatic polythene, the fire created by the explosion damaged the building structure.""To formulate a reliable hypothesis regarding the cause of the explosions, it is needful to consider:- in the unit 10C in the room above the crater there was a conspicuous mass of about 600/700 Kg of deflagrant explosive. The room was covered by reinforced concrete and a thick stratus of ground, vegetation and trees. The next rooms were inaccessible because of unusable opening and covered by vegetation. This material was part of the superfluous war escaped from the reclamation of 1997, as they were confined hermetically in the room;- when the explosion occurred, the dryers 41 and 21N were stopped because the guardian of the establishment had switched off the dryer systems one hour before the accident, intercepting any kind of arriving energy (vapour, electric power). The day of the accident was a no - working day indeed it was Sunday (07/28/2002);- the weighing building 35A was inactive and also when it is working, there isn't any kind of power;- before the first explosion there was a ""whistle"" of about 3/4 seconds.On the basis of the consideration mentioned above, it is impossible that the first explosion was in one of the structures 41, 21N, 22 F/G or 35A, as there wasn't power to generate the explosion of the stored substances.After a study of the ground around the buildings 10C, 41, 21N, 22F/G and 35A we believe that the first explosion was in the room 10C and the others were caused by the incandescent fragments.As concern the type of explosive exploded in the room 10C and his priming, it is possible to formulate some probable hypothesis:Explosive type: The exploded mass was composed by deflagrant explosive not inserted in metal boxes. We may say that because of on the strucures nearby the room 10C there weren't marks of splinter, and the crater had a regular morphology, that means that the explosion was linear. If the mass was formed by mortar bombs it would be very different, because of the many continuity solutions.Priming type:The cellulose nitrate and nitroglycerin propellants, as the probable ones of the accident (like propellants for military rockets, never produced in the establishment), during the time they became old, losing the stabilizer. The main substances of the powder begin a dissociation phase, creating an exothermic oxidation that generates HOT SPOTS in the explosive mass. If the warmth in this HOT SPOTS do not disperse in the mass, it may catch fire, creating burning gas and then it may explode. This kind of event is facilitated when the mass is a confined area, as the examined one.The burning gas whizz created before the explosion in the room 10C, it is the ""whistle"" heard before the deflagration.","The accident destroyed two dryers, a weighing and dosage building of the crude substances utilized for the fabrication of cartridges powders and a reinforced concrete building (from the last world war, unused waiting for demolition).As concern the product losses, 2.9 tonnes of pure cellulose nitrate (dry and humid) and 4.6 tonnes of a mixture of cellulose nitrate and nitroglycerin plus various additives (hunting powders) were involved in the accident.As regards the external damages, the establishment ask to the General Assurance to conduct an analysis, they determine that the explosions generate a shock wave that interested a large area of the Castenaso municipality arriving till Bologna municipality and Granarolo. There were deflections and lesions to the building structures, to the casing and to the furniture.The shock wave created damages without projections of materials from the establishment. Area concerned - Remarks: Concerning the internal establishment area, the interested zone is about 160 meters * 130 meters.
Regarding the external establishment area, the effects were the ones caused by the shock wave, without projection of materials. 
The shock wave gone in south direction till 1 Km and towards north till 300/400 meters.People - Remarks:The accident had no effects on people inside or outside the establishment, the total off-site population at risk was calculated in a radius of 2 Km from the explosion point.Material Loss - Remarks:The mentioned costs regarding the establishment losses refer to the strucure damage and to the product loss, but not to the losses caused by the judiciary stop.The costs concerning the off-site losses refer to the requests arrived to the insurance establishment. Community Disruption - Remarks:The municipal road Via del Frullo that border the establishment was closed to the circulation for about 6 hours, to facilitate the assistance means.A political representative began a parliamentary inquiry. ","The establishment guardian (as part of the IEP staff) gave the alarm after the explosions, advising the internal emergency group and the Fire Brigades of Bologna, they extinguished the fire hotbeds and under the coordination of the internal emergency committee coordinator they did an inspection to verify probably dangerous situations.The emergency ended in to hours.For a detailed description see Emergency measures - Remarks, below. Emergency measures - Remarks: When the accident occurred it was Sunday and the plant was stopped from 12 of Saturday. In the establishment there were only the guardian personnel formed by the guardian (also part of the IEP staff) and his family (2 persons). Outside the establishment there was a person for the grass cut (fire prevention).The establishment guardian (as part of the IEP staff) gave the alarm after the explosions, advising the internal emergency group and the Fire Brigades of Bologna, they extinguished the fire hotbeds and under the coordination of the internal emergency committee coordinator they did an inspection to verify probably dangerous situations.
In the establishment arrived also:
the Prefect and the Magistrate of Bologna, the majors of Castenaso and Bologna, the Regional Environmental Agency, the Local Sanitary Agency, the Carabineers of Castenaso and the artificer of the Bologna Police.
After an inspection of an expert the magistrature closed the plant, some days later the plant was opened except for the interested area and the impossibility of intervention on the risk ponits ( 2 loaded dryers, the storage deposit of cellulose nitrate and a bury tank with about 20.000 lt of solvents (50.000 lt of capacity).
Weeks later the dryers were emptied and the explosives stored in the deposits, then the deposit of the the cellulose nitrate was emptied and also the solvent tank (properly drained).
After the reclamation the processing of the semi-finished was ended till the final product to be stored.
The operation of put on safety condition the establishment, powder production is still stopped.
The monitoring points of the urban traffic do not observe significant change on the polluting agents in reference to the usual condition.
Subsequently the Regional Environmental Agency of Emilia Romagna did some sampling to verify the presence of amiantus fiber (some destroyed buildings were covered by amiantus), but the result was negative.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Before the accident the
establishment presented the SR and the Regional Technical Committee
evaluate it negatively, asking for integration. This SR didn't have the
risk analysis so there weren't accidental scenarios, the probable
occurrences and the effects.
The IEP was presented.
Moreover the establishment presented the Information Sheet even if it
wasn't exhaustive. ","Immediate lessons: The establishment reduced the substances quantities and suspended powders production, they began a study regarding alternatives technological cycles.Measures to prevent recurrence: Considering the hypothesis of the accidental event, they did the reclamation of the establishment except for the interested area that is still confiscated.They found mortar bombs, fuses, empty shells of different calibre destroyed in proper authorized pits from the military staff of the army.The reclamation plan was agreed with the local and central competent authority.The reclamation interested about the 80% of the establishment area, till 3, 4 and 5 meters of depth with a warranty of 4, 5 and 6 meters.Once the confiscated area will be available, a reclamation will interest this part till a depth of 5 meters with a warranty till 6 meters.&nbsp;"
688,1293,Major Accident,"Power generation, supply and distribution ",Explosion with subsequent fire at a biogas facility’s final storage repository,2021-09-15 18:00:00,2021-09-15 21:30:00,"The incident occurred during planned maintenance when the tank was disconnected from the gas network. The maintenance work was carried out by the operator.
The triggering event was a short circuit.On the day of the event, a regular inspection of the agitators was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Since a tensile cable attached to the agitator motor broke when the latter was lifted, it may be assumed that this caused damage (short circuit) to a cable.
The tensile cable was repaired and the motor, including its attachments, was visually inspected. However, it was not possible to detect the damage to the cable during this visual inspection, as the cable was located on the underside of the submersible motor, or underneath the agitator wing.When the motor was started to test the direction of rotation, the damage to the cable triggered the short circuit and thus the fire.
Safety measures:The tank was cut off from the gas supply owing to the planned maintenance and all valves were closed. As a neighbouring tank had also been completely emptied and cleaned during maintenance work (no biogas or digestate was present), the fire could not spill over to any other parts of the facility.",A technical defect on the agitator cable triggered a short circuit with sparking.,Burnt membrane roof.The remains of the membrane roof and the upper layer of digestate (10&nbsp;cm) were disposed of properly.,"An initial staff check was carried out and the emergency call was then made to the fire brigade. The area at risk was then cordoned off and a further check was carried out to ensure that all valves were closed. A check was then made to see whether any other parts of the facility were affected.
Removal of the old membrane roof, installation of a new gas storage facility, installation of new agitators.
The fire brigade extinguished the remains of the membrane roof with water.
Further measures: site closure, fire brigade briefing.","In future, this kind of maintenance work will be contracted out to a third party."

690,972,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Release of fuel oil in a river estuary during a transfer operation,2008-03-16 17:00:00,2008-03-16 00:00:00,"At 4.10 pm, a person on a barge observed the presence of hydrocarbons on the water surface and triggered alarm. BY 4.45 pm, aRounds-man identified and isolated the leak at 500 m upstream to where the hydrocarbons were detected.The internal contingency plan was triggered at 17:00 hrs and the inspection authorities of classified installations were informed. A ship equipped for hydrocarbon recovery was stationed at the mouth of the river while two trawlers recovered hydrocarbon pellets from the river.Investigations revealed that the leak was detected only after 5 hours , 478 tonnes of fuel were spilled, of which 180 tonnes flowed into the river Loire.Subsequent to the spill public access restrictions to several beaches and fishing prohibition in the river estuary were issued and were gradually lifted between the 04/04 and 18 /04. Over 750 people were involved for three and a half months in cleaning up the 90 km of polluted banks (6,170 tonnes of waste was recovered and stored on-site before disposal). A 16 cm longitudinal fissure caused by corrosion localised under the thermal insulation was detected upon examination of the pipeline. The corrosion resulted from a water leak in a pipe located above the pipeline. Water infiltrated under the thermal insulation, causing corrosion and subsequently the fuel pipeline rupture. Despite several faults detected during the previous months on the same pipe rack, the operator failed to revise his inspection programme such to take into account the specific risks presented by this pipeline given its proximity with the river banks.","The defective pipeline, 12 inches in diameter and lined with thermal insulation, forms part of a pipe-rack composed of some 20 pipes on two levels. An examination of the defective pipe section revealed the presence of a longitudinal crack approximately 16 cm long by 1 cm wide adjacent to the observed local corrosion underneath the thermal insulation lining. Water flowing from a perforated pipe, positioned vertically above the fuel oil pipeline, infiltrated under the leaky thermal insulation layer, first causing the steel to corrode and then perforating the pipe.A pipe verification and maintenance programme was adopted for the refinery site in accordance with a procedure developed in April 2007and designed to establish the various inspection and maintenance periodicities depending on the type of pipe configuration and potential vulnerabilities.The importance of specific maintenance works on the pipe where the leak occurred was however poorly evaluated in this programme, despite a number of warning signs during the preceding months on this particular group of pipes and despite the potentially serious consequences of an accident affecting one of these pipes given the proximity to the riverbank.  ","
Due to the effect of tides and currents, the fuel oil dispersed onto the northern and southern shores of the Loire estuary. Hydrocarbonpellets were recovered on beaches in the neighbouring Vendée Department and as far south as the Isle of Rhé. Pollution cleanup efforts,in some cases requiring mobilisation of up to 750 people at the same time, lasted three and a half months to clean not only some 60 km of fouled riverbanks, but also wetlands further inland (swamps, reed beds, etc.).Public access restrictions were issued for certain beaches and fishing was prohibited in the estuary; the restrictions would gradually be lifted between 04/04 and 18/04/2008.The environmental impact assessment on the flora and fauna was promptly initiated by setting up an accurate inventory of the number of affected birds. Observations performed twice a week by the National Office for Hunting and Wildlife revealed that that the number of bird deaths caused by this pollution spill was less than 10 throughout the entire Loire- Atlantique Department. The proportion of oiled birds kept decreasing as pollution cleanup progressed, with the affected bird population gradually leaving the area as time went by.Nonetheless, several tens of dead animals were recorded in both the Vendée and Charente- Maritime Departments over the following days, even though no scientific causality correlation could be established, especially given the type of species involved.The operator provided most of the manpower and took financial liability for all damages, pollution cleanup costs and compensations to affected professionals.","
The Internal Contingency Plan was activated and a crisis team was set-up in the Prefecture. Significant resources were allocated to both land and aerial surveying.Shortly thereafter, a ship equipped for hydrocarbon recovery was deployed at the river mouth as well as two trawlers in the estuary equipped with special nets for collecting hydrocarbon pellets. Floating barriers were also deployed in order to recover floating hydrocarbons.The affected fuel line was shut down; inspections on the entire rack detected several on other lines corrosion points requiring repair.Following both the first inspections performed after the accident and the first conclusions of the refinery’s internal accident investigation, several protective measures were implemented, namely:- permanent human surveillance along the pipe network bordering the Loire;- definitive shutdown of the defective fuel oil pipeline;- visual inspections and thickness controls critical points (braces, tapping points, etc.) after removal of the thermal insulation from the entire pipe rack bordering the Loire;- relocation of the service water pipe from the thermally insulated pipe-rack bordering the Loire.Moreover, a prefectural order prescribed the implementation of several technical and organisational improvement measures:_ Onsite :- Integration of liquid hydrocarbon and chemical product lines in the inspection schedule, considering their criticality with respect to environmental risks;- setting up of regulations for degraded thermal insulation detection and repair campaigns of;- setting up of regulations and procedures for repairing leaks on utility lines (particularly water and steam networks);- specification of requirements and allocation of remote detection equipment adapted to the various products and sensitive zones._ Specific to the pipe rack where the accident originated: - works on the ground underneath the pipe-rack, such to allow drainage of spills towards a gutter connected to the refinery’s oily water network, thus preventing leaks from polluting the Loire;- installation of a permanent monitoring and leak detection system on pipe-lines located in the vicinity of the Loire by means of thermal cameras coupled connected to an image management and abnormality reporting system in the control room, completed by a leak detection device in the gutter, in case of leaks occurring beyond the field of vision of the thermal camera system;- monitoring of product transfer operations by all means such to control that quantities transferred from the storage facility are actually received at the other end of the pipeline.An information and communication system for the various parties involved was introduced.This system comprises:- a daily press debriefing from the crisis team coordinated by the Prefect,- creation of a team assigned to distribute compensation to pollution victims,- organisation of regular meetings with local elected officials and associations,- constitution of a local information commission on river estuary pollution risks.","1/ Prevention measures: - The importance of monitoring corrosion or, put more
broadly, ""precursors"" of installation ageing in older plants and
sites (which extends beyond the case of pipe networks). Special attention must
be paid to:  _ ""corrosion sensitive points"" (corrosion
beneath thermal insulation, contact with supporting braces, etc.); _ installations positioned in the vicinity of sensitive
and vulnerable zones or located in an ""aggressive"" environment (tidal
effects, medium salinity, etc.). - Special attention must also be paid to monitoring
and maintaining pipe networks in the plant by means of establishing pertinent
criticality parameters (e.g. analysis of environmental risks related to a loss
of structural integrity, sampling and control modes that enable early detection
of corrosion or defects, periodicity of controls adapted to degradation
kinetics, acceptability criteria specific to a defect). Following this accident and based on results of
inspections carried out on the Donges site pipes, a nationwide action was
launched during 2008 focusing on probe controls of pipes carrying hydrocarbons.
In 2009, a widespread plan centred on the ageing of industrial installations
(petroleum, chemical) was initiated by France s Sustainable Development
Ministry, which by the end of 2009 will yield a national action plan. 2/ Detection and protection measures: The efficient control of certain specific operations
(ship loading, pollutant transfer, etc.), especially on expansive sites,
integrates appropriate resources to be allocated to leak detection and
protection as well as vulnerability of the specific media. 3/ Means of intervention: For those media in need, an action plan is developed
that prescribes tools dedicated to impact evaluation, intervention and
pollution cleanup, for mandatory implementation in case of an accident; the
conditions governing the availability ofsuch tools are also to be included."
691,745,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion in centrifugal pump containing Methyl-cyclohexane,2004-10-26 07:50:00,2004-10-26 00:00:00,"Explosion in centrifugal pump containing Methyl-cyclohexane.According to different statments and observations, it can be assured that:a) The operator suffered a heavy hit by the centrifugal pump cover when it abruptly opened, after deforming and breaking the bolts that closed it to the main body of the centrifugal pump.b) The abrupt opening was consequence of an explosion, due to the low explosivity limits of methyl-cyclohexane. This fact is proved by the deformation and cracks of the bolts and covers.c) The inertization did not avoid the explosion, either because the valve was closed, or because, even if it had been open, the placement of the nitrogen inlet and outlet, at the same level, cannot assure an effective clear of the whole volume of the centrifugal pump, even less for the existing trap and the connection between both.The ignition source is unknown.","Equipment did not include appropriate safety measures. Working procedures did not specify the risk. Inadequate management of dissemination of procedures. Inadequate auditing systems.

Brief description of the event:
Separating operation is performed without inertization. There is no indication on whether Nitrogen was connected or not. There was no kind of safety measure in case of absence of nitrogen, since this was not considered in operation procedures. The result was the explosion of the centrifugal pump and death of an operator.It can be indicated, as causes for the explosion the lack of efficient inertization of the centrifugal pump, lack of risk analysis and lack of operating procedures, along with an efficient system for risk control and inspection. According to the data available, the inspector reporting states that, had the establishment had documentation conforming and implementing RD 1254/1999, it would have been very unlikely that the accident would have taken place, so it cannot be excluded as a cause for the accident the failure of the establishment to comply with the law.Apart from material causes for the accident, other organisational causes must be studied. In this sense, it is reflected that:a) There had been no hazard analyses from the establishment regarding the centrifugal pumps working with solvents, required for this type of installations.b) There was not a clear working procedure specifying the hazards related to the activity.c) The operator did not have a specific preparation for the task, and his instructions were communicated to him by a person in charge.d) The inspection and / or internal control system took care of basic aspects of safety at work prevention but did not consider any element related to the risk of an explosion. Moreover such inspection was done by personnel in charge of production, not related to safety aspects.","1 operator died, 300.000 euros 

The room where the centrifugal pump was placed was destroyed, along with other equipment present there.The extent of the consequences was limited to the centrifugal pump room, which was partially destroyed.&nbsp;Affected Area: installationPeople - remarks: The explosion opened the centrifugal pump cover which broke the skull of the operator working with it. Workers both from the establishment as well as others from outside used fire extinguishers to extinguish the fire generated afterwards and took care of the victim, who was taken to a hospital, but he died at the entranceEcological harm - remarks: None, given that the remainder of the explosion and subsequent fire ended up on a waterproof floor and were drained to a safe place for treatment inside the establishment.","The rest of the centrifugal pumps will be adapted to essential health
and safety requirements, this will be supervised by OCA.
A new circuit for inertization will be designed, with flow control and
oxygen control blocking the start-up. A lock for the centrifugal pump
will be provided, along with new operating procedures and evaluation of
knowledge of the operator in charge.Official action taken - legal action: A sanctioning proceeding is open for failure of Safety Management System, regarding procedures for operations, control of substances and auditing. Also for not applying their own risk analysis. Official action taken - other official action: A sanctioning proceeding is open against the organisation that evaluated the Safety Report.Discussion about response: Report from Laboratorio Oficial J.M. Madariaga","Immediate lessons learned: Process risks will be analyzed deeply.
Installation of devices to control risks. New procedures for health and safety at labour.

Safety systems will be adopted to avoid operation involving risks
Working procedures including risks will be elaborated
Procedures to evaluate the operator, in order to check his/her knowledge of the process

Measures to prevent recurrence: Mechanical measures were taken for fixing machinery, lack of nitrogen in centrifugal pump, lack of clearing flow, new inertization to cover the whole centrifugal pump and nitrogen.
New operation systems, evaluation of learning.
These actions were done in the establishment, and in other similar establishments in the Murcia region.Measures to mitigate consequences: Execution of UNE standard for centrifugal pumps with flammable liquids.
When substances can generate an explosion, work should be done automatically without presence of operators.Useful references: There is a detailed report from Laboratorio Oficial Madariaga showing experiments with violent explosions involving Methyl-cyclohexane"
692,875,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of hydrogen chloride from a reactor vessel,2010-09-21 07:07:00,2010-09-21 08:15:00,"30 litres of water were to be introduced in the prescribed manner from a container into a reactor (in a manual controlled addition, depending on the reactor temperature) as part of a plant operator's control routine. Two shut-off valves (one metering valve and one pneumatic shut-off valve) must be closed before the water is added. The plant operator then opens the pneumatic shut-off valve using a process control system (PCS) and the water is added via the metering valve. The operator forgot to check if the metering valve was closed, so after the pneumatic valve was opened the full 30 l of water was released into the reactor, triggering a reaction, releasing hydrogen chloride and causing the reaction product to foam up. The gas-liquid mixture from the reactor escaping quickly through the exhaust pipes to the absorber increased the pressure in the reactor to at least 0.5 bar. This pressure surge resulted in the cooling coils breaking off two of the three vapour coolers. The hydrogen chloride/product mixture continuing to rise up from the reactor was thus able to penetrate through the cooling coils into the coolant pipe system and then escape through the pressure compensation tank opening into the building.
","The cause of the release of the hydrogen chloride was excessive water metering in a reactor vessel (30 litres in one go, as opposed to in 3 litre increments), which led to an uncontrolled exothermic chemical reaction. A glass cooler broke in the process and product leaked out via the cooling circuit. The bursting disc (set pressure 0.8 bar) was not damaged.
In addition to the operating error, an assessment confirmed the rupture of the cooling coils resulted from the pressure increase caused by the rapidly rising gas/liquid mixture.
","Cleaning and repair of the facility, removal cost, loss of raw materials, costs for fire brigade and police.
7 people outside the operating area were injured.
","The safety devices reacted in accordance with their intended functions. The bursting disc of the reactor (set pressure 0.8 bar) was, however, undamaged. As it was not contaminated, the pressure must have remained in the reactor 0.5 < p < 0.8 bar, before the cooling coil broke. The pneumatic stop valve of the water addition was closed automatically by the detected increase of pressure (with p > 0.2 bar). The fire brigade was automatically alerted and took further action in conjunction with the police. The plant management and the company management were notified via the emergency and incident management system, as were the other people flagged for notification in the system. On-site:
Sealing off and evacuation of the premises.
Fresh air from outside was used to dispel the polluted indoor air until the smell of hydrogen chloride in the building was very faint. Until that point, gas masks had to be worn by those entering the area.
The fire brigade sprayed the building with water to condense any remaining
hydrogen chloride gas or hydrochloric acid vapour.
The resulting precipitation in the operating area was
collected in a chemical catch basin and was channelled into the public sewage system after pH tests.
Restoration:
Residue from the reaction product had to be removed from the entire facility and the facility inspected for damage. Damaged parts were then replaced. Off-site:
-	Surrounding roads sealed off.
-	Order to keep doors and windows in the surrounding area closed (including radio announcements).
","Revision of the PAAG (hazard and operability study) concerning this process to take particular account of operating errors and balanced measures.
The PAAG revealed that the process for adding water must be technically restructured such that the maximum quantity that can be added at one time is limited to 3 litres. This happens through a second glass vessel with a maximum volume of 3 litres situated between the initial glass vessel and the exhaust pipes. Likewise, the shut-off valve to the reactor and the shut-off valve to the initial glass vessel are connected to each other, so that only one of them can be open at any one time. The buttons for operating these two valves are installed within sight of the valves so that permanent visual control by operators is ensured. This also limits the maximum amount that can be added to 3 litres and prevents recurrence of this operating error.
The operator carrying out the task must ensure, before the addition of water commences, that the dispensing valve is closed. This check must be consciously performed and documented from now on.
The PAAGs of other chemical reactions will be examined for potential operating errors. Findings from the Baden-Württemberg State Office for the Environment, Land Surveys and Nature Protection:
One of the main lessons from this incident is that there must be a balanced relationship between recognised danger points and the measures selected to manage them. In the event of a potential loss of control over the reaction process, only inherently secure process configurations or protection through PCE devices should be selected. When designing PCE devices, the reliability and inertia of the entire system must be taken into account. Coupling of the room ventilation system to the fire alarm system.

693,498,Major Accident,"Waste storage, treatment and disposal",Fire in an underground industrial waste storage facility,2002-09-10 04:15:00,2002-11-12 00:00:00,"Fire in an underground storage facility.This accident was notified because it is of technical interest.It was classified level 5 on the scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Comity of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive, the factor resulting in that level of classification being the number of third parties deprived of their means of employment.","At 4.15 a.m. on 10 September 2002, a fire was detected in the mine by miners on shift in adjoining shafts. As the walls are not airtight between the working shafts and the storage centre, the operatives were alerted by an abnormal smell. The fire was located in storage block n° 15 where 1,800 t of waste is stored: drums of soil polluted with arsenic, big-bags of household waste incineration bottom ash and industrial waste incineration bottom ash , big-bags of waste from asbestos removal work and big-bags of asbestos residues from a fire in a pesticide warehouse.The precise causes of the fire are not known. Several hypotheses have however been put forward, including: &nbsp;- The presence of waste that was still hot such as of household waste incineration bottom ash or industrial waste incineration bottom ash,&nbsp;- The presence of prohibited waste, especially flammable waste,&nbsp;- The presence of products incompatible with one another and/or that could develop incompatibility at mine temperature. So there is a presumption that waste classified as containing asbestos from a fire in a pesticide storage building, as this waste arrived packed in big-bags (the big-bags were not opened on arrival due to the asbestos hazard).","The consequences of the accident are directly linked to the smoke produced by the fire. Significant concentrations of sulphur dioxide were measured discharging into the atmosphere, at the air return shafts. The installation of barrages enabled smoke emissions from the shafts to be rapidly reduced. Analyses of micro-pollutants, made on samples taken at several places and in particular in the environment (soil and plants), did not reveal any notable impact. The main values exceeding the standards allowed concerned two carcinogen pollutants, benzene and benzo(a)pyrene. Subsequent analyses for those 2 pollutants on smoke captured in block 15 seem to conclude that the emissions were of short duration. Significant quantities of dioxins and furans on the walls of tunnels close to block 15, at a depth of 600 m, but no contamination was found on the surface.No effects were found on the health of people living near the plant. At the time of the accident, the public were not asked to stay indoors but three nearby schools were closed, as a precaution. However several miners exposed to smoke at the time complained of skin problems and throat irritations. These assessments were confirmed by the panel of experts appointed by the local information and monitoring commission (CLIS) which concluded that there was no particular risk to local people, the public or surface staff and reported that several emergency service crew members showed clinical signs of slight intoxication with carbon monoxide, skin disorders and digestive problems that required medical attention.Initially, the fire caused work to be suspended at the storage centre and adjoining mine: thus 27 storage employees and 350 miners were laid off. Subsequently, it ultimately marked the permanent ending of operation of the centre. The future of the 40,000 t of waste stored down the mine has not yet been decided. Moreover, the ending of potash extraction, which should have been in April 2003, was brought forward by 6 months.","After trying in vain to extinguish the fire&nbsp; by spraying it with water (given the depth of the storage, not much water is available) and by using extinguishers, the fire-fighters set up barrages intended to extinguish the seat of the fire by reducing the flow of air in the block. At the Prefect's request, a team of fire-fighters from the neighbouring mine, specialised in operating underground, also fought the fire but without success.Any action where the fire occurred could only be by operatives using independent protection equipment bearing in mind, in addition, that the temperature at the bottom of the mine was of the order of 32°C (these constraints limit the length of each firefighting session to a maximum of 30 min and make necessary the presence of a standby response crew on the surface to act if needed).On 20 September, there was an inspection which concluded that the fire was out, without however prejudging the possible persistence of hot spots, subsequently confirmed by ongoing measurements made in the block by means of an automatic sampler. As the hot spots persisted, work to inject nitrogen designed to ""inert"" the atmosphere in the block and thus extinguish the last seats of combustion took place between 23 and 25 October.At later inspections, it was found that there were still some hot spots. On 7 November, further extinguishing was undertaken by injecting nitrogen to the heart of the few seats that were still active.On 12 November, the fire was considered to be totally out.","Various reports were produced by experts to determine the causes and circumstances of the fire:&nbsp;- Legal report,&nbsp;- Report requested by the Administrative Court,&nbsp;- Administrative report,&nbsp;- Report produced at the request of the CLIS which appointed a panel of experts,&nbsp;- Report produced at the request of the CHSCT.Their conclusions are not at present known, the CLIS experts having only agreed with the assumption ""of self-ignition subsequent to biological decomposition, chemical breakdown or a chemical reaction between products in particular pesticides."""

One worker died following the injuries.About 9 a.m. a worker started preparing wastewater (from extraction process) in the IBC container for pumping to a storage tank which was emptied.IBC container (with the volume of 1 m3) with wastewater from drying process containing app. 2% of active oxygen, including app. 0.5% coming from organic peroxides, was storied from the end of January 2010. Wastewater was not systematically analyzed for its physical and chemical state.About 9:30, before a break, the worker placed a pipe of a rotor pump in the IBC container.After the break, the worker took the pump's motor/engine and went to the place where water was to be pumped.Due to the damages which appeared after the explosion it was not established whether the worker made the equipotential connection between the IBC container, pump and storage tank for technological sewage.About 10:00 a.m. the explosion occurred. The external (steel) and internal (plastic) parts of a container burst, its elements were thrown away and the liquid splattered.Due to the explosion the worker was badly injured and died.","The causes of the accident were as follows:- long storage period of waste water containing organic peroxides resulted in its separation in the bottom of the IBBC container;- lack of physical and chemical analysis of the properties of the substance;- use of a rotary pump (for pumping waste water) resulted in putting in motion organic peroxides (which separated at the bottom of the container) as well as the occurrence of the friction phenomenon and electrification of liquid;- lack of safety instruction for safe pumping of waste water, including possible accidental situations;- lack of analysis taking into consideration possible occurrence of the organic peroxides in the place where waste water is being pumped.",Due to the explosion one worker died.

A clearly detectable foam layer had formed and had released the overflow protection alarm.About 30 l of phosphoric acid added immediately for stabilisation, had no apparent effect. Next, a valve was closed between the first tank and an adjacent tank connected to it, and the first tank's contents was drained into a secondary containment basin. At the same time, the drained hydrogen peroxide was diluted with water, and the vapours were abated. In addition, the tank was externally cooled with water.Because of the risks for the emergency response team, the drainage had to be stopped. In spite of the measures taken, the temperature was still rising.Around 17:30, a fountain-like jet of hydrogen peroxide erupted from an open manhole. While the emergency response team started to withdraw the tank burst, the remaining hydrogen peroxide was dispersed over a large surface. 10 members of the fire brigade suffered skin burns. Most of the hydrogen peroxide was deposited within a distance of 30 m, and was then diluted and washed away with water (transitory storage in the emergency retention basin). A minor quantity of hydrogen peroxide came down beyond the perimeter of the plant as a droplet cloud, in the neighbourhood of the plant. As a preventive measure, the population was alerted.Cause: Probably the hydrogen peroxide was contaminated by alkaline process solution, which initiated the decomposition reaction. As a possible pathway, a ventilation pipe of a ring line  was identified as possible inlet point. This ventilation pipe leads to a decanter, used for a safe drainage of hydrogen peroxide in case of release. If the drain line of the decanter gets obstructed, the filling level in the decanter can rise significantly submerging the ventilation pipe with process solution. Considerable quantities of the process solution can therefore flow back into the tank without being detected.","10 members of the fire department's emergency response team were injured by the released hydrogen peroxide.
The material damage totals ca. 1.000.000 - DM 500.000 EURO.
","A valve was closed between the first tank and an adjacent tank connected to it, and the first tank's contents was drained into a secondary containment basin. At the same time, the drained hydrogen peroxide was diluted with water, and the vapours were abated. In addition, the tank was externally cooled with water.
Because of the risks for the emergency response team, the drainage had to be stopped. As a preventive measure, the population was alerted.
","A short time after the tank burst, another tank had been contaminated over a pressure bouncing pipe.
The main part of the contaminated tank content was drained and allowed to decompose. A small part was immediately processed. The tank was washed and put out of service
Another damaged tank was drained, cleaned and put out of service.
The ventilation pipe of the closed circuit line was modified to avoid the suction of process solution, before setting the ring line into service again.
The pipe has been set out of service meanwhile, to avoid any contamination by dusty air.
Local temperature indicators are replaced by remote indicators, releasing the alarm automatically when a fixed temperature gradient is exceeded.
Moreover, measurement data are recorded.
New tanks to be installed, will be equipped with a pressure relief system (folding roof).

A fire spread and destroyed two other existing storage buildings located 60 m far away.","According to expert opinion, the most probable cause was the accidental triggering of fire cracker igniters and other fireworks after falling. Rodents, which had already been noticed in the storage, may have been the cause of the fall.","The explosion, perceived at 30 km distance, damaged also workshops, storage facilities and offices. It did not cause any casualties or on-site environmental damage. Following the initial ignition mentioned above (fall of pyrotechnic materials, probably due to rodents, which triggered the explosion), the fire may have spread to other ignitors or cardboard packings. After a certain time, the fire reached the detonation cords which exploded forming a small crater.The products dispersed by this first, relatively, limited explosion caught fire, affecting the anti-hail rocket-engines(containing ammonium nitrate explosive), which detonated partially, forming a 1.6 m wide and 0.25 m deep crater.Approximatively 20 seconds later, ammonium nitrate, tolite (TNT) and pentolite type explosives detonated, forming two large craters. The largest one had a diameter of 5.4 m and was 1.5 m deep. The power of the explosion, according to calculations, corresponds to 1770 kg TNT (tolite). The explosion blasted the metallic structure of the building and the blasting effect severely damaged two other storage buildings deforming the structure of one. These storage buildings were hit by incandescent metallic projectiles. Due to the damaging of the external panelling, fires ignited. Cases containing gunpowder exploded in one of the storage buildings. The second one burned with sporadic explosions flares. The combustion of smoke candles and similar products created a dense black smoke.The 142 employees of the plant were put in technological unemployment. ","Alarm was raised immediately by the two watchmen.The fire brigade, to protect the rest of the installation, first extinguished secondary dry grass fires and then brought the principal fires under control at 21:30 h.The following day the burnt storage buildings were flooded in order to avoid the risk of new explosions. The damaged storage buildings were covered with tarpaulin.","The reconstruction of the destroyed facilities was subjected to a new authorisation procedure.

When the Original Report was prepared, the accident was under administrative and juridical investigation and a more detailed description was not available. A first information based on the investigation of the Fire Service showed that the fire started in a fuel oil tank and was transmitted through the drainage channels to other tanks. Tanks D1, D2, D6 and D7 (containing fuel oil), tank D4 (containing diesel oil), tank D8 (containing crude oil), tank D9 (containing naphtha), the empty tank D3, the loading station and the offices of the installation were destroyed while tanks D5 (with fuel oil) and D10 (with crude oil) which caught fire were saved. Tanks D11 and D12 containing naphtha were not set on fire. Explosions occurred in tanks containing fuel oil and crude oil. Besides, a BLEVE of about 70 m3 of water occurred. Toxic substances were released in the ambient due to the incomplete combustion of the petroleum products involved in the fire.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The fire started in a fuel oil tank and was transmitted through the drainage channels to other tanks.
CAUSES:
When the Original Report was prepared, the causes of the pipe failure were still under investigation.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:According to the information given by the Fire Service, 12 people were injured by fire and 13 were injured by the release of toxic fumes produced by the incomplete combustion of the petroleum products during the fire. All of them were inside the storage installation. From the
Original Report is not fully clear if people were hospitalized or not.MATERIAL LOSS:10 out of the 12 storage tanks were set on fire and 8 of them were destroyed. The fire also threatened an adjacent storage facility for petroleum products. The cost of these material losses has been estimated in about 0.016 MECU.ECOLOGICAL HARM:In the Original Report no information are available about possible environmental harms due to the dispersion of the toxic substances produced by the incomplete combustion of petroleum products during the fire.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:After the initiation of the fire and its transmission to tanks D7 and D8, portable dust-fire extinguishers were used and when the fire spread to other tanks water and foam were also used and fences-protection walls were erected.EXTERNAL SERVICES:Portable foam generator.

702,81,Near Miss,Chemical installations - Industrial gases,Release of oleum from a heat exchanger in an acid tank storage facility,2013-02-27 13:53:00,2013-02-27 14:25:00,"On 27&nbsp;February 2013, there was a leak in a tube-bundle heat exchanger in an acid tank storage facility, which led to the release of approximately 120&nbsp;kg of oleum.
The heat exchanger is used to control the temperature of the oleum by means of a recirculation process and thus prevent solidification during storage. The process is only necessary in the winter months; an exchanger that has been installed for 10&nbsp;years therefore has an operating life of only about five years.
Process/sequence of events
Steam enters the shell through a side nozzle just behind the tube sheet. An impact plate is fitted to prevent the steam from hitting the bundle directly.
The damage consisted in a tube wall being punctured on the outlet side of the oleum. The formation of sulphuric acid when the leaking oleum came into contact with the heating steam then caused local corrosion of the non-alloy steel shell, allowing the oleum to escape into the environment.
The plant fire service created water curtains to combat the sulphuric acid aerosol mist. No persons or property or the environment were affected, either on or off site.","Steam erosion as a result of an impact plate that was too small is considered to be the main cause of the damage to the tubes.
Secondary damage to the heat exchanger tubes was caused by the formation of sulphuric acid, leading to erosion of approximately 2&nbsp;mm of the thickness of the tube walls in the space of 36&nbsp;hours.","The plant fire brigade put water curtains to combat the sulfuric acid aerosol mist. There was no impact on people outside or inside the factory premises, things and environment.",- Plant fire service alerted;- Supply pump switched off;- Line valves closed;- Sulphuric acid aerosols controlled using water cannons.,"The expert recommends using a larger impact plate and regularly measuring the thickness of the tube walls (initially after a year of steam operation).

He was taking a sample of a product that had been pending transfer for two days in the adjustment tank when the ‘high temperature’ alarm triggered in the control room. Around 9.00 a.m. tests confirmed thermal decomposition of the product. An attempt to render the gas inert by adding a mixture of zinc oxide and water failed at around 11.00 a.m. Technical difficulties delayed the preparation of the neutralising mixture in a mobile mixer: connection problem, mixture prepared too quickly. The scrubber overloaded and the odorous cloud escaped from the site.","Several causes were identified:
On Friday 18 January, a worker inadvertently started up the adjustment tank stirrer rather than the recirculation pump on the unit’s control panel. After being transferred to the tank on Saturday morning, a batch of product at 94&nbsp;°C gradually heated up until Monday morning, when the thermal decomposition was discovered (T &gt; 110&nbsp;°C). The staff patrolling the site over the weekend had not noticed that the stirrer was in operation, despite the indicator light on the control panel being on and the shaft visibly rotating at the top of the tank.
As a storage tank had been filled and there was no demand, the operator stored some product in an adjustment tank whose transfer and recirculation systems were working on manual mode only following the deployment on Friday of a software security measure that deactivated the pump’s remote control feature so as to prevent the storage tank overflowing.
16 years earlier the tank had been transferred from another unit with a stirrer and heat insulator that were not suited to the current process; this had been done without a change management procedure.
It was unusual for the pump to be started up manually and the stirrer, which had in principle been put out of service in 2006 but was no longer shut down following poorly supervised maintenance, was started up by mistake.
The status of the stirrer was not recorded in the control room and the staff on watch had not been instructed to start it up manually or check it visually.
The risk analysis had not identified the risk of the ZDDP decomposing slowly at around 110&nbsp;°C.
From the control room the temperature in the adjustment tank was checked only when the recirculation pump was stared up before manual sampling.
The measures planned for dealing with the decomposition stabilised the decomposition reaction without stopping it.
The scrubber was set up for a large-scale release of H2S (conservative toxic scenario) and was quickly overloaded when mercaptan emissions exceeded trace levels.","The odours spread across the entire department before reaching the Paris area and the south of England overnight. Tens of thousands of people were inconvenienced, with some complaining of dizziness, headaches, vomiting, etc. A&amp;E services handled around 20 cases in the Rouen area.","The operator launched its emergency plan at 10.00 a.m. and informed the prefecture at around 11.30 a.m. 33 municipalities received automated emergency notifications.

The prefect set up an information desk on the Tuesday morning and, as a precautionary measure, launched the external emergency plan at 10.35 a.m. Between Wednesday morning and Friday evening a new operating procedure made it possible to ‘safely’ neutralise, in 12&nbsp;t batches, the 36&nbsp;t of decomposing product before transporting it in trucks to an incineration plant.","The operator took out the tank’s heat insulator, installed cooling devices that can be deployed in 15 minutes, modernised the running of the unit (block diagram and hierarchy of alarms for continuous monitoring of the temperature and rates of H2S/mercaptans at the stack, introducing redundancy for temperature measurements and making them more reliable, etc.), and recalibrated the scrubber to handle large-scale releases of mercaptans. The operator also improved the surveillance and intervention procedures for exceptional situations, stepped up awareness-raising and training for staff on emergencies, analysed the changes made to the other equipment installed 16 years earlier and improved the procedures for checking and testing equipment."

The mixture was collected in the containment basin. The amount of butadiene released into the atmosphere is estimated at 8 t (calculated using mass balance).","The 1,500 t sphere (which still contained 100 t of butadiene) was being emptied in preparation for a major turnaround of the manufacturing unit for maintenance and inspections. The operation involved filling the sphere to the top with water to transfer the residual butadiene by overflow to a second sphere. The supply rate of the sphere was increased during the operation by installing a DN 100 diameter, 10 bar supply pipe, without assessing the associated risks. The resulting flow rate was too high compared to the overflow rate to the second sphere. The pressure in the first sphere therefore increased until the valve opened. There are no concerns about the calibration of the valve.
The incident was the result of a change in the list of points to be checked (change of supply rate) for an emptying operation, with an insufficient assessment of the risks associated with that change.","Measurements at the limit of properties showed low initial concentrations of 25 ppm that fell to 5 and 0 ppm after 30 minutes and 1 hour 20 minutes respectively. The emergency services used 2,200 litres of foam. The volume of fire water collected in the basin was 800 m&sup3;. &nbsp;The butadiene concentration measured was 38.6 ppm. The mixture was pumped and then treated with activated carbon. The amount of butadiene released into the atmosphere is estimated at 8 t (calculated using mass balance).",Two operatives equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) shut off the water supply within a few minutes and the valve closed. The sprinkler network was activated by the two operatives. The operator launched the internal emergency plan. The gas alarm was sounded and the plant staff were put into lockdown. The operator informed the neighbouring municipalities.,"The remedial action concentrated on improving the checklists:

by including warning and information points for operatives, incorporating the main safety points (limitation) and explaining the background to these points;
by specifying whether they involve equipment that could give rise to serious scenarios;
by ensuring a process of validation by the process safety service, in particular for the equipment that could give rise to scenarios taken into account in the technology risk management plans (plans de prévention des risques technologiques - PPRT).

This caused a fire at the North East corner of a store of 1,200 m2 containing saw dust, starch glue, seed, agrochemicals and seed treatment machinery. The fire was reported at 19:22 to the local fire brigade and was nearly extinguished by about 21:00. At about 21:15 a dust explosion occurred and the fire spread again. It was finally under control after midnight. In total, about 1,500 m3 of fire fighting water was used.

A pyromaniac set on fire some papers and packing materials. This caused a fire at a store of 1,200 m2 containing saw dust, starch glue, seed, agrochemicals and seed treatment machinery.

CAUSES:
A pyromaniac set on fire some papers and packing materials. The toxic substances (i.e. methiocarb, thiram, carbofuran, ecc.) were not stored in a separate cell but they were together with saw dust, starch glue and seed. This allowed their combustion and release during the accident.As the removal of this product heat exchanger had been planned during the next scheduled shut-down, it was permanently removed after the accident. The cooling water return system was cleared up.

After this accident, the installation of a closed-loop cooling water system should be recommended for plants where accidental leakage of products into the cooling water may be harmful to the environment.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:2 people were injured by fire.MATERIAL LOSS:The water cooling of the walls and the entry confined the fire to one cell but the store was burned out and the stored materials destroyed.

More precisely, the leak took place at the point of connection between the separator and its level measuring instrument.
First a compressor on the synthesis gas circuit was shut down following a malfunction. When the compressor stopped, there was a slight increase in pressure (25 -> 29 bar) upstream (at the low pressure end). Normal pressure is roughly 25 bar, and the system is protected by a 30 bar pressure relief valve. The pressure of 29 bar, although not too high for the installation, caused the connecting pipe to break on account of heavy wear resulting from undetected corrosion under the insulation. A leak of hydrogen (25 bar) occurred (at roughly 15.30), and caught fire at about 15.45. A flame jet approximately 10 metres high then damaged various surrounding installations (domino effect). Equipment containing oil that became engulfed by the flame jet also caught fire. Although no one was hurt in the accident, the damage caused (solely on the company's premises) was significant, and the plant had to be shut down for several months for repairs. We estimate that roughly 700 kg of hydrogen was released during the leak.
","Corrosion under the lagging of the pipes connecting to the measuring instrument;
Failure to detect the corrosion.
","No injuries, no damage outside the site and no environmental impact. Significant damage to equipment near the leak and shutdown of the plant for several months.
","The flame jet was extinguished by closing a valve located upstream of the hydrogen leak (once the valve had been closed, the flame jet gradually became smaller and smaller until the hydrogen from the installations between the valve and the leak had burnt off completely as a result of the leak). The company's emergency response team fought the (oil) fire and cooled the equipment near the flame jet so as to minimise damage. The oil fire was brought under control at about 16.10 (the fire began at about 15.45 and the leak at 15.30), which was also the time at which the fire fighters arrived. All that could be done at that point was to wait until the flame jet had stopped burning because there was no more hydrogen and to cool the neighbouring installations (->16.45)
","Improvement of the system for inspecting insulated pipes;
Installation of an automatic fire extinguishing system in the compressors;
Moving equipment containing oil away from the compressors.

The night guardian passed a check-point behind storage tank No 31 at 04:00 am and did not notice anything abnormal. At 04:00 am 2 employees arrived in the office company (it is situated about 250 m from the parking lot for lorries). A few minutes after their arrival 5 valves on the tanks' bottom were activated including tanks No 30 and 31. At 04:10, a driver from the parking lot passed by the office to warn about a petrol smelling mist on the parking place. The two employees check this phenomenon (moving around in car!) first at the parking place and then inside the establishment. At 04:20 the 2 men observed a mist whiter than fog at the east counterfort of the tank No 22 and inside the retention basin of tanks No 30 and 31. None of the other retention basins contained any mist. The mist entered the parking lot passing under the counterfort separating the retention basin from the parking lot. The mist covered the whole parking area and was just about reaching the road. At 04:20 am a violent explosion happened originating from the parking place and propagating towards the storage area. The two employees were thrown in the retention basin by the shock wave, but managed to return to the office and close the automatic valves. The emergency services arrived on-site at 04:38 am. The police blocked the access to the roads around the storage facility, and the railway traffic was interrupted. The tanks caught fire at 04:50 am. The fire was extinguished at 12.17. A more detailed accident case history description is shown on Annex No 1 attached to the Original Report.","CAUSES:
A leakage (source unknown) of unleaded petrol formed aerosol (estimated volume about 25,000 m3) that was ignited by a lorry, parked but with motor running.

This led, amongst other things, to the failure of the cooling brine pumps and the HF cooling machines. The duty electrician was sent for immediately afterwards. The lack of cooling and the pressure build-up in the whole system led to a visible emission of CaSO4/H2SO4/HF from the two rotary kilns a few minutes later.This was stopped by opening the emergency extraction system immediately. Due to the lack of cooling capacity, the liquid HF evaporated in the condensers. The resulting large quantity of gas was drawn into the kilns as a result of the emergency extraction and then escaped at the kilns’ sealing points. The raw materials feed was then shut off. In parallel, the brine pump was manually started, but in spite of the electrical starting pulse being given, this pump did not start. The cooling machines were then able to be started with the help of the electrician. At that time (15:30), emissions were already starting to fall due to the feed of raw materials being halted.As the brine pump was not running, the cooling machines failed again due to unused cooling capacity. At that time it was noticed that the brine pump was not running; this was then successfully started. The emissions were then stopped (15:36).At 15:40 the site squad, who had been called, arrived, followed at 15:55 by the site fire brigade. By then, there were no more emissions. It was no longer necessary to put a water curtain in place.
Safety measure:Shut down the HF production facilities after the cooling machines and coolant pumps could not be started immediately.",The trigger was a lightning strike on the electricity supplier’s 110 kV line.Voltage fluctuation of external power supply.,No impact other than the release of these substances can be reported.,- The on-site fire brigade was called and attended;- Emergency extraction was activated;- The HF production plant was shut down.,"
The reading of the status indicators (directly at the pumps/facilitators/compressors) and the visualisation of the main status indicators in the control room has been completed.

- Extraction/emergency extraction- Brine pump/cooling circuit- Cooling equipment
The status indication is given by an indicator light in the measuring station.The same applies to the extractor fans of two emission sources, as well as to the status indicator of the cooling machine.&nbsp;

The replacement of the brine pump circuit breakers has been completed. An external expert review was carried out. Maintenance plans have been drawn up.


Sensors of the NH3 plants used for safety shutdown have been replaced so that they continue to operate in the event of a power failure thanks to a battery buffer on the 24&nbsp;V circuit.


A new revision of the operating instructions has been drawn up and staff have also been given additional training specifically to deal with the failure of this equipment.


The site emergency and contingency plan folder has been adapted and staff have been trained for this specific failure scenario.


An investigation was carried out into the security of the power supply and/or risk mitigation in the event of grid-related works disruption. The results will be integrated into maintenance planning and targeted measures (projects) and implemented in a multi-annual programme.

An explosion occurred in a batch chemical reactor (8 m3 nominal capacity) which contained 1.5 m3 of waste solvent. Debris from the chemical reactor punctured storage vessels in the Process Building and storage tanks in bunded areas adjacent to the process building resulting in another explosion and subsequent fires. The chemicals involved were contained on site or discharged to the environment. Damages and associated costs estimated in about 20 millions Euros.","CAUSES:
A runaway chemical reaction occurred in a chemical reactor which became overpressurised and ruptured. Limited investigation undertaken by the company prior to the accident did not identify the potential for same to occur. The post accident chemical reaction hazard analysis tests have established that the accident potential could have been anticipated.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Slight injuries occurred to two employees. Some people engaged in fighting the fire were sent to hospital as a precautionary measure. All were released from hospital the following day. The reason for so few injuries was that the relevant building was partitioned into two areas and all personnel in the building were in the area least affected by the major accident.ECOLOGICAL HARM:Harbour waters and foreshore were contaminated by the fire water run-off. Levels of solvent found in inshore pools and water were below the levels likely to give rise to acute toxicity. Biological inspection of the shore adjacent to the establishment did not provide any evidence of damage to invertebrate organisms. The dispersion of toxic cloud is shown on two photos attached to the Original Report.MATERIAL LOSS:The material losses, including the business interruption, has been estimated at about 27M Euros. The cost of off-site losses has not been determined.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:Water distribution to the community was interrupted for 24 hours.

At about 8:00am a process operator commenced an azeotropic distillation (according to the work instructions) of toluene contaminated with water contained in a drowning vessel. However, three days earlier the main condenser had been removed for maintenance without previously checking the contents of the vessel and cutting off the utilities (steam, electricity supplies). The vapour line had not been isolated. The operator applied steam to the jacket of the vessel and, after about 15 minutes, it reached a temperature of 80-85°C. A significant amount of toluene vapours was seen to vent from the 10.2 cm vapour line into the building where a number of processes were performed and various hazardous materials were stored. Flammable vapours did not find a source of ignition. The operators turned off the heating and applied cooling. The site alarm was sounded and the process building was temporarily evacuated.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The distillation of the toluene/water mixture took place with the main condenser removed from the plant for maintenance. The drowning vessel was containing 2,500 litres toluene/water. The toluene vapours were vented into process building through the vapour line.

CAUSES:
The condenser was removed from the plant without precautionary measures being taken to ensure it was safe. The permit to work system was in operation but was not followed properly by the operator, probably due to the insufficient training. Besides, the procedures for maintenance and work permit were insufficient.
","Since the toluene vapours were vented, through a 10.2 cm vapour line, into a process building no toluene release occurred in the environment and no effects occurred outside the establishment.People - Remarks: 20 people working in the process building when the accident occurred. They were immediately evacuated until the site was safe. No one was injured during the accident.Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The site alarm was sounded and the operators turned off the heat source for the steam and applied cooling to the drowning vessel.

After loading the catalyst into the tank, at around 12.45 they arrived at unit No 3 (Deep Conversion Complex [KT]) to unload it into the B-201 hopper. On the instruction of senior operator R.J., the shift operator G.S. went to hopper B-201 to unload the catalyst. Upon arrival he saw two workers (V.G and A.J.) from the company 'Paslaugos tau' by the tank. They had already connected the air-feed-to-tank hose to the company's technical air system and the catalyst feed hose from the tank to the B-201 hopper. After checking the connections, G.S. unscrewed the technical air feed valve to the tank. After arriving at the tank, where A.J and V.G. were standing, he saw that the manometer read around 3 bar, which they agreed was sufficient pressure. G.S. went to unscrew the bolt to the B-201 hopper. After unscrewing the bolt to the hopper, he noticed that the hose to the catalyst was starting to move. He then turned to look at B-201 hopper and heard an explosion. After the catalyst dust had settled, he turned off the air hose valve and went over to the tractor. There was no tank on the tractor trailer, and A.J and V.G. were lying by B-201 hopper. The technical characteristics table for tank FKB 1/1 (factory number 30242) gives the tank's operating pressure as 0.083 MPa (0.85 bar) to 0.147 MPa (1.5 bar). The technical air pressure fed to the tank was almost 4.2 bar. During the explosion, pressure at the B-201 hopper did not increase. The bolt on the hose at the back of the tank on the catalyst feed to the B-201 hopper was not open.","- inappropriate manipulation of work equipment (tank);
- inadequate in-house occupational health and safety checks (no checks were carried out on the manipulation of the tank);

736,934,Major Accident,"Production, destruction and storage of explosives",Fire in a sieving plant of propellants for ammunition.,2013-03-26 04:05:00,2013-03-26 04:30:00,"The accident occurred in a building in which propellent powders for ammunition with ADR classification UN1.3C are sieved. Sieving is one of the final processes in the manufacture of propellant powders. The sieving unit in question comprises two circular sieves positioned in series within a cylindrical housing made from stainless steel. The cylindrical housing is vibrated by forced oscillation and the spherical powder to be sieved is fed into the unit via a mobile hopper moved by hoist apparatus. At the machine outlet, after sorting according to grain size, the useable powders are retrieved in collection hoppers and waste is collected in suitable bags. In principle, the sieving apparatus operates automatically without an operator being present in the sieving hall. The operators fill the feed hoppers and empty the processed product from the collection hoppers when the machine is shut down. On the day of the accident, two operators were assigned to the sieving plant: a young employee on a short-term contract, still in training and an experienced operator in charge of training him. On 26 March 2013, the operators' first action was to dismantle and reassemble the sieving plant, as laid down in the operating procedure, with a view to cleaning it before starting the actual sieving of the powder. At around 4 a.m., a malfunction occurred in the sieving plant and a fire broke out in the machine which then spread to all the powder located in the sieving unit. The most experienced operator was in the room at that time (his attention had probably been drawn to a suspicious noise). The alarm was set off and the ultrafast-response flooding and sprinkler systems were triggered. Nonetheless, the fire spread to a second 250 kg hopper of powder which the second operator was bringing to the entrance to the room, and this generated a second fireball. Lastly, a third 250 kg hopper containing powder, probably already filtered, located outside the room and not yet removed to an appropriate storage place, also caught fire, generating a third fireball, which was observed by the witnesses that came to assist the victims. The two operators suffered serious second- and third-degree burns; they were, however, able to exit the building on their own and remained conscious during their transfer to specialised hospitals, where they received appropriate care. Despite this medical attention, in the weeks following the accident both victims died from the effects of their burns.","Observations indicate that the fast-closing fasteners on the sieving unit opened during the sieving process. Since they were no longer tightened in place, the filters shifted out of their housing, causing metal-on-metal friction which - probably - caused the powder to catch fire. The sieving unit's top cover had a confining effect when the powder was burning, leading to a build-up of pressure in the machine and - very probably - a deflagration of the product that would be the cause of the displacement and significant deformation of the cover. At this point, there was a sudden eruption of flames from the sieving unit which burned the operators then in the immediate vicinity of the machine. A nut used to fasten the sieve housing which was found on the floor after the accident shows no sign of being torn off, suggesting that it gradually worked loose during the sieving operations. The operator's presence in the hall could be attributable to his having approached the sieving unit in order to investigate the cause of the problem after becoming aware of some equipment malfunction (the abnormal noise) without shutting down the machine, despite the fact that procedure stipulates that entering the manufacturing hall is not permitted when the equipment is in operation.","In the months following the accident, both operators (the usual experienced operator and a young employee on a short-term contract, in training) died from the consequences of their burns. A third person who had intervened to assist the victims suffered from slight smoke inhalation and was sent to hospital for observation but was discharged on the day of the accident. Material damage to the plant, which was completely destroyed.","The third victim (who suffered some smoke inhalation) attempted to assist his colleagues and, instead of going to the assembly point when the alarm sounded, entered the building affected and sprayed his colleagues with water, using the fire-fighting equipment he could find.  The automatic extinguishing system worked correctly but because the fire started - we assume - inside the machine, the detectors (ultra-fast IR and UV cameras) were not able to detect it quickly enough. The extinguishing system did, however, prevent the fire spreading to a second neighbouring sieving unit.","- Need to improve the sieve hoop fastening to prevent it coming loose from its housing and creating sparks (metal on metal contact). - Need to increase staff awareness of the risks in the manufacturing building to ensure compliance with procedures preventing staff access when machines are operating. - Installation of a presence detector that automatically shuts the installation down as soon as access doors are opened, and total automation of the process of loading powder in the unit."

On July 4, a recorded check was made on the holder. It included the check of the cup seals, too. The gas holder was deflated on July 9 to the top cup seal level to allow visual inspection of the cup below the water line. This inspection involved reduction of water in the seal by pumping water from the cup. The examination was completed and water pumped back into the seal to the original level. The holder was then inflated normally overnight to allow physical measurements in preparation for fitting low cup water alarms. Soon after full inflation, at approximately 7:00 am on July 10, the top seal failed and gas escaped. The holder rapidly lost height until the top cup seal entered the holder watertank. The gas cloud had dispersed without igniting. The last operator intervention was on the afternoon of July 9 and the seal failure occurred at approximately 6:55 am on July 10.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:

The pipeline fractured because of rapid chemical reactions inside. Leading to reaction forces and the pipe whip.,"The vent system (a four inch pipeline of about 240 feet long) was used to clean a vessel. The purpose of the vessel was to ad AlCl3 to the process. The vessel had to be cleaned with water because of problems in the normal process. The vessel was situated at a level of about 60 feet high. In order to ad water to the vessel the pipeline was used. At ground level the pipe was disconnected and a cast iron Saunders valve was attached. The fire water system was attached to the Saunders valve. Not very well known was the fact that in the pipeline were quantities of AlCl3 and TiCl4 as a deposit. The water and the deposit caused rapid reactions. The rapid pressure rise had the force of an explosion, but the pressure itself did not exceed the burst pressure of the pipe. This is proved because of the fact that longitudinal cracks did not develop. The fast pressure was transmitted in all directions. As mentioned before the pipe resisted the pressure in circumferential and of course also in longitudinal directions. But the pressure (probably a pressure wave) was directly transmitted through the water to the end, where the Saunders valve was situated, in almost completely closed position. The pressure wave resulted in a brittle failure of the Saunders valve housing. As a result of the thrust of the water and the vapour, expelled at a high speed, induces strong reaction forces on the pipe, resulting in a pipe whip and so destroying the pipeline in several parts.The loosening of the pipe end and the vertical ends of the pipeline in which water was able to form a kind of blockage, may have played a role in the accident. Also important is that probably the single reaction between water and TiCl4 at itself was not enough to be the cause of the accident. It was the combination of reactions between water and TiCl4 and AlCl3 that caused the problem. The reaction between AlCl3 and water is exothermic, and sped up the pressure rise.","1 death, 3 persons injuredPeople - Remarks:one fatality was due to hit by the Saunders valve, 3 men were seriously injured due to explosion of vapour cloud (VCE)Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","alarm phase, HAZOP study to be performedOfficial action taken - legal action: Official report was made under supervision of the coroner involvedOfficial action taken - other official action: Required: plant change, change of cleaning procedure, HAZOP study","Immediate lessons: installation altered, working method changed.Measures to prevent recurrence: Process safety analysis needs more attention, also in the case of procedures like cleaning"

High gas velocity and small metal particles in the pipeline are assumed to have damaged the protective titan-oxcide layer on the valve disc, and caused the following ignition. The high temeperature in the room lead to melting of insulation on electrical cables, and the gases released reacted with pure oxygen and caused the explosion and the following shock wave that caused the death of the electrician passing by outside the room.

It has been notified to MARS because of its technical interest.","The ladle fall was due to the catastrophic rupture of one anchor plate of the hook on the lifting beam of the overhead travelling crane. The crane was 3½ years old, and had been installed as a complete replacement of the previous one. The rupture occurred where an enclosed longitudinal weld reached the end of its enclosure, so that its extension could flex freely.","The accident seriously wounded one person (third-degree-burn of the hands and legs). He was an employee of an outside company who was in a van located outside the building close to the zone where the cast iron pool formed. He was injured while escaping from the vehicle, which was completely destroyed by fire.&nbsp; 

The massive cloud of dust of iron graphite and iron oxides released during the accident was observed at a distance of 15 km from the site.
","A fire, started by thermal radiation, was quickly controlled by the emergency services of the site. The steel works was closed for 6 days, the time required to assess the damage and repair the second crane (loss of production: 18,000 tonnes of steel per day). During this period, the blast furnace was set to minimal operation (4,000 tonnes/day) and cast iron was cast into ingots in external pits dug for the purpose, to be later extracted for re-working. These operations generated considerable dust nuisance.","The owner was required to carry out study of possible hazards on the site, in particular domino effects, and, in conjunction with the supplier of the overhead travelling crane, to ensure that similar situations could not occur in the future on this or other sites (design of the anchor plate, choice of the type and form of the components).&nbsp; 

The rupture occurred in the transition zone between a longitudinal weld and its free-flexing extension.  Cracks going right through the plate were also found in the corresponding anchor plates of the twin overhead travelling crane n°563, provided by the same manufacturer and 5 years old. The crane was immediately repaired."

The equipment's pumping system had exhibited problems, and was undergoing testing when a leak appeared in a branch pipe and burst into flame upon contact with hot walls. The internal teams shut down this equipment and also another that had become unstable. An external operator discovered the leak and alerted the platform's fire fighters, who arrived with five fire engines. The fire was extinguished, but oil leaked into the interstage below; despite the foam layer that had been put in place, a layer of oil caught fire in the piping 20 minutes later. The internal fire team extinguished the fire. The plant was shut down from the control room and the steam cracker degassed by flaring, creating an extensive flame and a column of black smoke. The oil spill was cleaned up and the effluent was channelled into a retention basin at the plant's internal water treatment facility. The oil-soaked lagging of some pipes was removed. The operator informed the Classified Installations Inspectorate, the prefecture and local municipalities, and issued a press release. Despite the slowing down of the steam cracker, the flaring episode lasted for 48 hours, the time required to eliminate the remaining production output and recalibrate the equipment. The damaged branch pipe (50 cm x 1"") had been added during a long shutdown a few months earlier, in order to facilitate the draining of the air/oil accumulators of the compressor (which make it possible to absorb shocks) in preparation for use. The breakage took place at the coupling thread of a shut-off valve. An analysis was carried out in order to determine the causes and circumstances of the breakage.
","The rupture at the connection thread of the ¾ inches oil pipe ¾ on an isolation valve, is due to a progressive fatigue cracking due to vibration appeared throughout the oil circuit.
Vibration and notch effect in the thread root (a 5 mm thread emerging largely beyond the useful engaged height which is approximately 10 mm) are the main factors behind the rupture. The low surface area occupied by the final rupture area shows that the stresses applied were relatively low; their thread root concentration (intensification factor constraints may be equal or greater than 10) has favored the appearance of cracks (several firings identified in the periphery of tubing).

749,259,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of chlorine in a plant as consequence of the power failure at the public power supply,1991-11-15 13:45:00,1991-11-15 00:00:00,"As a result of a failure of the public power supply there have been problems with telephoning. Possibly due to an overburdening of the telephone net companies have trouble reaching the Chemical Incident Number in the period just after the power failure. No reports have come in at CIN (Chemical Incident Network Line) between 13.40 and 13.56 hour. Therefore, directly or indirectly due to the complete power failure the TDF/Tiofine company was not able to inform the public services at once (exact information about this problem can not be retrieved any more). It took about 8 minutes to inform the Police Alarm Centre via the CIN.
The chlorine went underneath the chlorine detection system which was located at the height of 3 metres. This may explain why the emission went unnoticed and why no gas alarm was given. Another factor of influence may have been that due to the power failure the system was not working anyway. Unfortunately it is not possible to retrieve the exact reason why the gas detection system did not function. As a result the company did not notice the emission at all. A telephone call from the neighbouring company learned them about the existing problem. As described earlier there was nothing left to do but examining the effects of the accident. The following evacuation process was very chaotic.","- Failure in public power supply- Failure of emergency power supply of TDF Tiofine- System error in that the valve to the chimney is closed during a power failure.- Failure of the chlorine gas detection system through a power failure and/or a design error.- Procedural error in that TDF personnel awaited the consequences of the incident too passively.- In general, a relatively low safety policy at TDF/Tiofine.&nbsp; ","Not significant damage

751,121,Major Accident,Production and storage of fireworks,Mass explosion during the transfer of maroons at a fireworks facility,2016-06-29 15:40:00,2016-06-29 16:00:00,An explosion occurred at 3.35 p.m. at a pyrotechnics storage facility classified ‘Seveso upper-tier’. The site manager was using a forklift truck to transfer explosive materials between the loading/unloading bay and one of the warehouses. He was killed on the spot. A second worker nearby was also killed.,"The classified installations inspectorate identified several significant shortcomings:
A forklift was used instead of the dedicated in-house vehicle for transferring products between the loading/unloading bay and the warehouses’ delivery area;
The pallet on which the cartons were placed was not film-wrapped.
The route followed by the forklift was on a slope. A package appears to have fallen and been run over by the wheels of the forklift. There was then a friction/hotspot effect on the pyrotechnic substance that had spilled on the floor. This is based on the fact that the fork became detached from the forklift and the vehicle’s wheels were torn off and blown outwards around 20&nbsp;m on each side. This configuration indicates that the initial load affected was probably under the forklift and that the explosion spread to the main load on the pallet.
Several other theories such as the pyrotechnic substance being unstable, pyrotechnic material leaking following a quality fault in a maroon, etc. have been discounted. Indeed, maroons from the same batch have been examined by experts without any anomaly in terms of stability or conformity being revealed. The products, which were manufactured by a Portuguese company, had been delivered the previous day to another site managed by the operator and then transferred that morning, for storage, to the site where the accident occurred. The operator had been working with that manufacturer for around 10 years. However, this was the first time it had ordered 75 mm maroons of this type.","The body of the site manager was found beside the forklift. That of the second worker was found further down from the site of the explosion, having probably been moved when a 120&nbsp;m3 water tank burst.
The 2 people who died were the only people present on site when the accident occurred. The site manager, who died in the accident, had worked there for 18 years. The second victim was a temporary worker who had been employed for the season.
A crater 1&nbsp;m wide and 0.3&nbsp;m deep was formed. The forklift was completely burned out and had been shifted back 5&nbsp;m from the crater. Metal and plastic debris from the forklift was scattered across a radius of 30&nbsp;m. The roofs of 2 warehouses 50 m away were damaged, presumably by the blast. There was no damage off site.",Two of the company’s workers who had left the site a few minutes before the events turned around after hearing the explosion and observed the release of a plume of white smoke (mushroom). They raised the alarm. The internal emergency plan was launched. Firemen put out the fire on the forklift.,"After the accident, the operator:
Decided to completely stop buying maroons and products in hazard division 1.1;
Reminded staff of the categorical ban on using a forklift to transfer products between the loading/unloading bay and the warehouses’ delivery area;
Reiterated the need to transport products in closed packages, and for packages to be film-wrapped when on pallets;
Put in place security meetings twice a week in busy periods;
Put in place checks (scheduled and unscheduled) to ensure that instructions, safety rules and operating procedures are followed properly. These checks will be carried out by managerial personnel not involved in production;
Commissioned an audit of how operations are organised;
Updated the establishment’s hazards study, particularly as regards analysis of the risks linked to handling and internal transport of pyrotechnics."
752,918,Major Accident,Chemical installations - Industrial gases,Explosion of an oxygen pipe,2010-06-13 13:45:00,2010-06-13 15:20:00,"Buried for 36 years at a depth of 2.5 metres at a Seveso site for the liquefaction of air for the Lorraine industry, an oxygen (O2) pipe with a pressure of 40 bar exploded at 13:45 at the boundary of the property, at its point of entry into concrete culverts under a railway track belonging to the factory.","Intermediate expert reports point to poor laying, the quality of the soil/backfill, differential compaction of the layers of the subsoil, which was of poor quality due to the railway track... Phenomena that would have been visible at the surface, but were not reported, according to the expert, who supports the hypothesis of corrosion aided by prolonged immersion in water due to a fluctuating and shallow (- 2.2 m) water table (Moselle region), sulphate reducing bacteria or chlorides, which would explain the pitting on the outer surface of the pipes. The investigation also revealed a section of the pipe that had been replaced (and was thicker) 5 m from the rupture and the unexpected ovalisation of one end of the pipe.
The final expert report regarding metallurgical matters revealed several combined factors: failure of the impermeable membrane of the sleeve, groundwater fluctuations in the sleeve, creating environment discontinuities for the electrolyte and reduced cathodic protection, localised degradation of the covering combined with separation of the tar. After water had come into contact with the tar/steel interface, a nascent corrosion pierced the pipe, and a small release of O2 thereafter accelerated the phenomenon.
According to the records, there was neither mechanical disruption (construction work) nor excess pressure. The environmental administration received a report on the accident (including the emergency response plan and a technical dossier about the pipeline. The removed pipes stood in the open air for two months before being delivered to the experts. Having noted generalised corrosion in August, the environmental administration demanded that they be put under cover.
","A 1 m segment of ""unrolled"" oxygen pipe lies in a pool of water. A crater (diameter 7 m / depth 3 m) was formed, mud and pieces of road surface and concrete were hurled 50 m, and pieces of debris weighing 1 and 15 kg were thrown 60 and 30 m respectively. A nearby concrete wall was partially destroyed, and the fence was damaged. The TNT equivalent is estimated to be 0.14 kg. There was no visible flame emanating from the pipe, but a 220 / 24 V transformer 3 or 4 m away caught fire. The pipe was emptied over a distance of 13 km, releasing 257 tonnes (180 000 m3) of O2. The damage was valued at 1.05 million euros.
An uncovered O2 pipe and an N2 pipe also passing through concrete beneath the rails were near the damaged structure. The nearby N2 pipe that feeds the safety systems of several sites could have been damaged, risking a rupture. This pipeline could not be closed off without causing a shutdown of the client installations.
","The emergency response plan was activated, and the fire brigade and police intervened. At 14:30, a 26% level of O2 was recorded at a distance of 5 m from the isolated section. The operator informed its clients and issued a press release at 18:00 hrs. An uncovered O2 pipe and an N2 pipe also passing through concrete beneath the rails were near the damaged structure. The nearby N2 pipe that feeds the safety systems of several sites could have been damaged, risking a rupture. This pipeline could not be closed off without causing a shutdown of the client installations.
The environmental administration called for a security perimeter to be established around the oxygen pipe, a lowering of the N2 pressure and the installation of a security camera. Under the 'pipelines legislation', a prefectoral order confirmed these points and requested expert opinions on the metallurgy of the damaged pipe and the geotechnical aspects of the manner in which it was laid.
","The lessons to be learned include:
- the activation of the emergency response plan (compulsory for upper tier Seveso plant), since the accident was on the edge of the factory's property, on a section of transport infrastructure and not a 'factory pipeline'; the extent of the following should be specified in the safety analyses: the degree of covering of the pipe in the emergency response plan.
- safety studies regarding laying techniques and the local hydrogeological / geotechnical characteristics in order to better understand the geological uncertainty caused by groundwater fluctuations,
- the distances of the effects of the 'violent rupture': crater, wall, projectiles. Besides the findings of the 'security studies' for the operator to verify, the ELS, PEL and IRE zones for such pipelines could be reviewed.
- apart from contracted work or earth movements, corrosion as the initiator of a rupture.

This reduction lasted until no more droplets were emitted.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:At the moment of the failure there were the following weather conditions:- Temperature: about 5°C- Wind direction: from east- Wind speed: about 3m/secACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:Due to a loose and partly removed section of the water distribution unit, a uniform distribution of wash water in flue gas system did not occur. Therefore the acid content in the wash water in a part of the flue gas system increased strongly. The wash water must then have formed big drops on the way between the washer and the chimney mouth. These drops did not evaporate completely to the atmosphere due to their size and the weather conditions at the time of the incident, and fell down as drop emission in the immediate vicinity of our installation.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:A section of the water distribution unit was loose and through thisan emission of droplets from theflue gas chimney took place. As a consequence the plants, both crops and ornamental ones, in the area around the installation were etched.Causes:As cause of the emission of droplets it was been established that a failure occurred in the washer of waste boiler no 3 for domestic waste. This failure consisted of a loose section of the water distribution floor of the washer. Probably due to a material failure this section could become loose over an area of about 1/4 square meter. The final report from experts is not yet available. The information available in this moment does allow the conclusion that there is no long term damage to the environment, animals or human beings. Furthermore may it already be concluded that contact with plants and soil polluted by the drop emission does not pose any acute health problems.","- Ecological harm: ( Amount: 10,000 D) Etching of the nearby plants (ornamental and of use) about 14 ha.","EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The affected neighbours were contacted and informed on the cause of the damage. Furthermore the regional Institute for Emission Protection, Essen, has been asked to evaluate the reasons for the release and the effects.",INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Immediately after establishing the damage to the scrubber the loose section was changed with a new one. Furthermore all sections of the scrubber floor were tested to confirm that they were not loose and in good conditions. As a precaution also the scrubbers of the other incinerators for domestic waste were checked. The affected scrubber will be definitively put out of service at the end of 1993. Until then this scrubber will be controlled regularly and the water distribution floor will be renewed completely. This should ensure that there are no more emissions of droplets.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENTAt the moment a new flue-gas purification plant is under construction. To this new unit the three incinerators for domestic waste will be connected. The new flue-gas units will be so equipped that drop emission is no more to be feared. At the end of 1993 the three incinerators for domestic waste will be connected to the new flue-gas unit.

The operator had found corrosion on the support 3&nbsp;years earlier. However, the database for inspections of this type of support contained incorrect information (two types of support had been mixed up) and the correct check for the piping on this type of hollow support (gamma radiography) had therefore not been carried out.
Before the fire broke out, the alarms set at 20% of the lower explosive limit had gone off, but the control room operators did not notice them. The control room operators had filtered the alarms so as only to display those relating to the processes of another unit that was being restarted at the time. They interpreted the flashing light signal in the control room as a ‘process’ alarm on the unit being restarted (such signals are not only for fire or gas alarms).
The ignition source has not been precisely identified.",Nobody was injured on site or outside. A plume of smoke was visible and an odour of hydrocarbons discernible in neighbouring municipalities (radius of 8&nbsp;km). No soot was detected in the vicinity. Slight iridescence was detected in the canal. Waste water was pumped and treated at the site&rsquo;s own plants. The distillation unit was partially destroyed over an area measuring around 50&nbsp;m x 50&nbsp;m. Flaring had to be carried out on a number of occasions.,"At 3:39 a.m. the control room operators launched the emergency shutdown of the unit. Supply to the charge line was cut off, the unit was isolated and the fixed firefighting systems in the area were set off. At 3:44&nbsp;a.m. the in-house firefighting equipment (26,000 litres of water per minute and 6,300 litres of foam per minute) were deployed. The internal emergency plan was launched at 4:06 a.m. A security perimeter was set up and the road to the site was closed. The fire brigade was called as backup to carry out atmospheric readings around the site (H2S, SO2, NO2 and VOCs). At around 8:00 a.m., the prefecture recommended that local residents and employees of nearby companies stay indoors. The water used to extinguish the fire was collected and tested by the operator. Floating booms and absorbent socks were put in place in the canal beside the site. The fire was brought under control shortly after 8:00 am. As the atmospheric measurement network in place around the site had not detected anything, the recommendations to stay indoors were lifted at around 10:25 a.m. The main fire was put out at 11:30 a.m. Burning gas was still leaking at around 4:30 p.m. The last secondary fire was extinguished at around 6:00 p.m. Cooling continued at night. The internal emergency plan was lifted the following day at 2:25&nbsp;p.m.","The operator drew up an action plan on how to prevent and detect leaks and what to do if they occur. It began an inventory of tubular supports (trunnions) to ensure that they were correctly identified and assess their condition. It removed the rock wool sometimes found inside the supports, which is conducive to corrosion, and planned for replacements where necessary. It reviewed the fire and gas system architecture and the associated control system (possibility of filtering alarms) and raised awareness among control room operators. It increased explosive gas detector and fire camera coverage."

Luckily the released gas was not ignited so there were nog further consequences.
The presure safety protection opened under its design set pressure.
&nbsp;","Bursting discs failed below there design pressure.
Pressure relief valves opened below there set pressure caused by the sudden pressure surge they experienced after the bursting discs burst.
The bursting discs were the last of a lot bursting discs, so no test could be done to determine the actual burst pressure of the bursting discs. No specific reason was found for their bursting.
There was an elevated pressure, but within normal operting window, in the ethylene intake station due to a blocking in of the station after ethylene intake was stopped and the gradual heating by the sun during the day.",Ethylene release in the air.,The ethylene intake station was blocked in to stop the release. This was initiated manually since the overpressure interlock was not triggered since the pressure safety system opened under it's set pressure.,"The bursting disc was added to the safety valve to reduce the risk of leakage of ethylene. In this case the presence of the bursting discs most likely caused the safety valves to open at a pressure below their set pressure, so contrary to their intent causing a release.
Two valves could be closed from a safe location.
A third valve was closed in the installation by production personnel that entered the danger zone. Personnel needs to be aware of the danger of such operations."

The internal emergency plan was launched. The fire was brought under the control by the internal fire team and the fire brigade.
There was significant material damage and the unit was shut down for three months.","Because of very adverse weather conditions (thunderstorm, high winds), the installation had been shut down at 7.50 p.m. – i.e. a few minutes before the accident – in line with the procedure in force.
The explosion detection system indicated that two events had taken place 2 seconds apart:

a small explosion in the vicinity of the cyclones used to treat the air from the spray drying tower;
then an explosion, followed by a fire, in the dust filter on the 4th floor. This filter was linked to the air-locks under the cyclones via the ventilation circuit.

An expert investigation revealed that this chain of events had originated in the air-lock under the cyclones. An explosion had occurred within the air-lock. The explosion can be explained by the simultaneous presence of oxygen (since the air-lock was filling up at the time of the accident), dust at an explosive concentration (presence of particularly fine dust in suspension during the filling-up stage) and ignition energy. The most likely hypothesis concerning the ignition energy is that an electrostatic ignition source was present. The relatively high temperature of the fungicide with the unit in shut-down (up to 104&nbsp;°C as compared to 70&nbsp;°C during production) might have made the product more sensitive to such a discharge. In addition, the low air humidity during shut-down might have led to significant generation of static electricity. The hypothesis of the product self-igniting has been ruled out as the temperatures needed for self-ignition of a dust layer are far higher than those reached at the time of the event (220-250 °C versus 104 °C).
The explosion in the air-lock was probably followed by:

propagation towards the cyclones situated above the air-lock, causing combustion of the product in the cyclone legs;
propagation of an ember from the air-lock explosion towards the air-lock’s gas vent and then to the dust filter via the ventilation pipes. As the air-lock was filling up, the vent valves connected to the ventilation system were open. The dust filter contained dust at an explosive concentration. The ember from the air-lock caused the filter to explode and then go on fire.
","A worker with light injuries was taken to hospital but recovered quickly.
The unit had to be taken apart for investigation, cleaning and repair. According to the operator, the losses totalled &euro;&nbsp;4&nbsp;million. The installations were started up again in April, three months after the accident.&nbsp;",The internal fire team and the fire brigade were called after staff noticed flames in the filter vents. The internal emergency plan was launched at 8.45 p.m. The firefighters brought the incident under control around 11.00 p.m. and the internal emergency plan was lifted at 11.15 p.m. The operator put in place overnight surveillance.,"After the accident and before the installations were started up again, the operator:

improved monitoring of the temperature on exit from the spray drying tower, particularly during shut-downs;
replaced the polymer filter vents with metal vents (since they have a more accurate opening range under pressure than polymer vents).

Other improvements are planned for the coming months:

making it possible to inject water into the filter from a remote area so as to reduce the risks in the event of an explosion (reducing human consequences via a more remote intervention area and reducing material consequences via more reactive extinguishing);
studies on:


the possibility of putting in place additional temperature controls (on exit from the cyclones, on exit from the filter) so as to detect problems early;
the feasibility of a smouldering fire detection system so as to detect combustion earlier;
the feasibility of putting place additional automated security systems (emergency shut‑down) if an explosion is detected in the dust filter or if the filter’s vents are open;
technical solutions to reduce the risk of ember transmission between the air-lock/cyclone legs and the air-lock/dust filter;
the possibility of reducing the quantity of product in the air-lock (so as to reduce the likelihood of electrostatic discharge).

Interruption of the heating process and start up of the cooling system. Opening of the by-pass valves. Plant evacuation. Sealing of the flange connection.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The rupture of a seal in the pipeline connection from the autoclave to the rupture disk caused the release of about 4 tonnes of vinyl chloride. About 1 tonne of vinyl chloride passed through it into the production hall and from there, through the roof, to the open air. Remaining 3 tonnes of vinyl chloride escaped into the open air via the by-pass line. Process heating was interrupted and the cooling system was started up. Initially, the production hall was evacuated, later the whole plant.","CAUSES:
The vinylchloride leakage was caused by the defective seal of the flange in the connection pipeline from the autoclave to the rupture disk. The seal failure was caused by both inadequate process analysis and component design.",MATERIAL LOSS:The accident caused small damages to the plant.People - Remarks: No people were injured during the accident.Ecological harm - Remarks: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms.Disruption of community life: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant effects outside the establishment.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Evacuation of the production hall.

No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:After the accident the following measures were established:1- modification of the man-hole cover (use of bayonet shutters instead of a flange connection);2- interlocking of vinyl chloride dosage device with the man-hole cover so that the dosage device remains closed until the man-hole is perfectly closed;3- control of seals after every charge;4- filling the ring groove with water to allow the early identification of leaks by bubble formation.
762,1328,Near Miss,LNG storage and distribution,Safe shutdown of an underground natural gas storage facility and release of methane into the atmosphere,2022-03-07 19:20:00,2022-03-07 22:00:00,"While gas was being withdrawn from the site, safe shutdown with venting was automatically triggered at 7:20 p.m. following a voltage drop on the 24VDC network powering the safety programmable logic controller (safety PLC) controlling the site’s safe shutdown system. The triggering of this safety procedure caused the release of 25,000 m³ of natural gas, or 16 t of methane.","The operator identified two causes that triggered safe shutdown with venting.The first cause was the triggering of a relay in the LV (low-voltage) switchboard room. This cut off power to the LV switchboard room supplying power to the safety PLC for the cabinet controlling the site’s safe shutdown system. The relay was triggered by a disturbing current from one of the supply circuits of the LV switchboard room.
The second cause identified was linked to malfunctioning of the backup power supply to the cabinet’s safety PLC. The safety PLC has a backup system of chargers/inverters/batteries that should have enabled the teams on call to take action in good time to prevent the triggering of safe shutdown with venting. During the investigation conducted on the evening of the accident, the failure caused by a voltage drop affecting this safety PLC was placed on ‘maintenance’ status as a precautionary measure. This meant that any alarm would be relayed to the control room without triggering safe shutdown. It was also established that the battery system was working properly, with power supply to the safety PLC being maintained when power was cut. The batteries undergo regular maintenance and were in good condition.The failure of the backup power supply was caused by poor cabling in the relays of the charger in the cabinet. This cabling problem has been dealt with, so the backup function of the batteries is working properly again.","The volume of natural gas released during this safe shutdown with venting was around 25.000 m&sup3;, representing 16 t of methane. Natural gas, which is primarily composed of methane (over 80%), is a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. The quantity of methane released during this event represented 7% of the site&rsquo;s methane emissions in 2021.","Following the failure, one of the preventive measures taken was to apply the lockout/tagout procedure to the LV switchboard room’s two most energy-consuming supply circuits (air compressor and site staff facilities) until the investigation had been completed. The aim here was to minimise as far as possible the risk of a disturbing current triggering safe shutdown again.","The LV switchboard room and associated equipment have been under surveillance since the accident and are no longer locked out during working hours. The safe shutdown system has not been triggered again, while the analysis of the equipment carried out after the accident did not reveal any particular fault in the circuit-breakers or relay. This equipment will be replaced as an additional precautionary measure."

In order to establish the cause of the fluctuation a service hatch of a process vessel located between the scrubber and the condenser was opened. Prior to the opening of the hatch nitrogen had been fed into the process in order to create an inert atmosphere. However, the high level of liquid inside the condenser had blocked the intended route of the nitrogen which instead flowed into the adjoining main power plant boiler. Inerting having thus failed reactive process gas was still present in the process and when the hatch was opened incoming oxygen and the process gas reacted leading to an explosion.

At the time of the accident the plant was still at the commissioning stage so there was no experience of operating such a plant. The aim of the commissioning stage is to ensure the process runs as designed and to find appropriate operational and control parameters for the actual production stage. Typically a number of modifications need to be carried out during the commissioning stage. Thus, comprehensive hazard identification and risk assessment play a particularly important role in ensuring the safety of the plant.

Overpressure developed in all parts of the digestion plant because of the sudden, simultaneous failure of the individual systems, e.g. gas injection, feedstock supply, stirrers. The safety devices did not operate due to the power failure, so neither the foam control system nor the foam trap were able to prevent digestate from entering the gas pipeline system. The pipe through which the gas produced is extracted was thus blocked and the devices for relieving overpressure and underpressure were activated.
This caused gas to be released into the atmosphere. The relief devices operated normally, but the foam control system (water, de-foamer) and the foam trap were out of action.

The operation of the plant was organized in two shifts. Since the hydrogenation at Reactor 6 would have taken at least 30 hours, it was not possible to complete the reaction during a single shift. The reaction was commenced at 8:00 a.m. on the day of the accident and, at 11:50 p.m., the shift chemical operator closed down the system as follows:
- he shut off the hydrogen addition at the reactor and closed the valve at the hydrogen cylinder bank;
- the reactor's agitator was turned off and the reactor was left isolated with an hydrogen atmosphere over the liquid.
No nitrogen inerting was used. The operator checked the reactor's control panel which showed normal operating temperature and pressure. The operator was also in control of Reactor 5 which he shut down in a similar manner. At approximately midnight, as the chemical operators were changing in their locker room, they heard a loud explosion coming from the process area. As they evacuated the building, they observed a fire around Reactor 6. The area sprinkler system was automatically activated and quenched the fire. It was noticed that one operator was missing. He came to the assembly point a few minutes later and said that when the explosion occurred he was trapped in the mill room weighing finished product. He could not exit by the process area and had to exit through a hatch on the floor, jump onto a rotary dryer below and climb down to the ground floor. A second explosion occurred a few minutes later. A fire with a characteristic black smoke resulted, indicative of a solvent fire. The sprinkler system extinguished this fire. A short while later, the fire services arrived and put out small localized fires on the ground floor around Reactor 6. The building was left vacant for the rest of the night.
","CAUSES:
An analysis of the Reactor 6 contents showed that approximately 400 litres of the total contents (about 1200 litres) remained inside the vessel. A quality control analysis of this material showed that the reaction was progressing satisfactorily before the incident. Examinations have shown that combustion should be supported inside the reactor as nitrous oxide was generated in the process. An electrostatic discharge could have caused the first explosion but this was considered unlikely on investigation. The most probable cause of the incident was a defective agitator. The maintenance record on the agitator showed that it malfunctioned on numerous occasions  but the maintenance was not sufficient. It was felt that the agitator possibly malfunctioned again allowing a hydrogen leak. As the reactor was located in a general process area with plants operating nearby, the released hydrogen could easily have found an ignition source as some of the electrical plants operating nearby were not suitable for use with hydrogen. The investigation showed that the reactor's pressure relief line did not operate as the bursting disc was found to be intact.
","MATERIAL LOSS:The extent of the damage caused by the explosion and the following fires was as follows: the reactor was badly distorted; the valve on the underside of Reactor 6 was also distorted and leaked; the sightglass in the manlid was shattered; the agitator was blown from its seating and deposited a few metres away; the glass fittings on Reactors 5 and 7 were shattered; electric cable insulation was charred and paintwork on the walls, ceilings and nearby millroom doors was scorched as far as 15 metres away; the glass in the windows on the first floor was shattered and the window frames distorted next to Reactors 5 and 7; windows up to 30 metres were blown out. The costs of the damage has been estimated at about 0.4M Euros.People - Remarks: No people were injured by the explosion because, when the accident occurred, the operators were changing in their locker room except for an operator that was trapped in the mill room weighing finished product. He could not exit by the process area and had to exit through a hatch on the floor, jump onto a rotary dryer below and climb down to the ground floor.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The process building was evacuated.

The charging chute was also propelled upwards and damaged the kettle's agitator motor. The contents of the vessel was unaffected. The bursting disc in the kettle's pressure relief line did not ruptured.","CAUSES:
Investigations carried out after the accident showed that the steel charging chute was not bonded to the reactor because of the presence of a non-conducting gasket in between them. The most likely cause of the explosion was the ignition of phthalic anhydride dust by a static discharge from the unbonded chute. The bursting disc in the kettle pressure relief line did not ruptured. The underlying causes were a lack of safety culture together with a design plant inadequate.
",EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:1 person was injured by the explosion (he was blown back by the overpressure and broke his arm as he fell to the ground).

The shift operator arrived at the bay at 00:45 and, with the help of the tanker driver, started to make the necessary routine off-loading hose and nitrogen pressurizing connections. After applying nitrogen pressure to all four tank compartments, the operator noticed that compartment No 2 was air-locked and bubbles were visible in the flow sight glass. He left the control bay and attempted to clear the air lock by opening and closing the discharge valve. As he was returning to the bay to check again the sight glass, he saw flames creeping up the near side of the tanker. Immediately he operated the alarm switch located in the bay which simultaneously started the deluge system and initiated the on-site emergency routine. The tanker driver has incorrectly returned to his cab and had to jump clear as the flames engulfed the vehicle. The works fire team used hand-held AFFF extinguishers and the fire was controlled before of the local brigade arrival on-site. The driver suffered only minor injuries but the shift operator was detained in hospital for one day as he was suffering from severe shock and received minor bruisings and abrasions in his haste to descend the loading bay access stairway.","CAUSES:
The initial cause of the carbon disulphide spillage was the failure of an EMCO-Wheaton quick release hose connection. The female half has two diametrically-opposed lever operated locking cams: due to incorrect engagement or accidental displacement of these levers, the coupling fell apart during carbon disulphide discharge under nitrogen blanket pressure.

775,625,Major Accident,Plastic and rubber manufacture,Fire in a polyurethane dust silo ,2012-11-14 15:00:00,2013-03-14 22:00:00,"Fire broke out in a 60 m³-silo half-full of polyurethane dust, in a Seveso-classified plastic insulation panel factory. At approximately 14:00, there was an explosion in a polyurethane panel crusher; its expansion within the silo increased the pressure and one of the outlet vents gave way, causing a second explosion noise. Subsequently a fire broke out, releasing smoke and gas, including carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The alarm was set off at 14:05; 80 staff members were evacuated and the internal emergency plan (POI) was deployed. The internal safety teams made use of a factory fire hose and called the external emergency services at 14:15, who arrived between 14:30 and 14:45. The power supplies to the site were cut off and rainwater-network blocking valves were activated.
The police force and gas, electricity and rail service representatives, as well as the deputy mayor and sub-prefect arrived on site. At 15:30, safety representatives evacuated the industrial and commercial zone (26 persons) and restricted movement for 500 local residents. A safety perimeter was established around the site. Fire service officials, equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), cooled the silo with fire hoses. Foam was injected from above. The undertaking does not have any technical drawings of the silo at its disposal. The maximum hydrogen cyanide concentration recorded was 4 ppm, compared with the exposure limit value of 1.9 ppm. The extinguishing water overflowed the retention structure but still remained contained on site, retained by the waterproof external courtyard. At 19:00, power lines were reconnected and one production line resumed operation. The fire was fully extinguished at 22:00. At 01:00 a second production line resumed operation. During the emergency, one firefighter was affected by carbon monoxide. With resources from other departments, a network to measure the level of hydrogen cyanide in the affected area could be set up.
The following day, at approximately 10:00, once the hatch had been opened, SCBA-equipped firefighters emptied the silo from the bottom. This work was then taken over by a private company. The inspectorate responsible for classified facilities attended the scene. The safety services completed their work by 20:00.
There was only limited damage to the site: The cladding panels of a workshop were blackened by smoke and the crusher was slightly damaged; the silo can be repaired. All production lines, which were shutdown for a few hours and which remained intact, resumed operation on 15 November.
The silo in question is used to store two forms of polyurethane dust waste: fine machining dust aspirated off and passed via a bag filter before being transferred to the silo and coarser sawdust particles aspirated off as waste from a polyurethane-panel crusher located directly adjacent to the silo (linked by 20 m of tubing to enable aspiration from the crusher to silo). The dust particles are ultra light, weighing 450 kg per 30 m³. Given the site layout, it is unlikely that the machining section caused the fault (given the intermediary transfer via the filter, the duration of the aspiration process, absence of metal components, etc.). It is probable that the crusher was responsible, considering the fire marks on that device and the fact that crushed panels contain a fine layer of aluminium that could have generated a spark. Moreover, the crushing of panels releases pentane, which can be explosive or flammable under certain conditions, such as, for example, when a crusher heats up. These panels are often the source of fires breaking out in storage containers during crushing. The operator examines these hypotheses in the accident report.
The operator is looking into installing a spark detection system in conjunction with a valve diversion or water sprinkler system. Further measures are envisaged: increasing air dilution in the crusher area, installing pentane detectors, and installing a belt or screw conveyor for the open-air evacuation of crushed panels. The crusher will not resume operation until the completion of corrective and preventative measures, the implementation of which will be monitored at the next meeting of the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CHSCT).","The waste panel crusher is responsible for the fire in the dust silo.
Potential causes: the breaking of a metal component, creating sparks causing fumes to explode, or an electrical fault or electrostatic energy created by the crushing of panels coated in aluminium.
","Release of smoke and toxic gas.
80 staff members were evacuated and a safety perimeter was established. 26 persons were evacuated from the commercial zone and movement was restricted for 500 local residents for a three-hour period.
600 m³ of water used to extinguish the fire was collected in the factory’s recovery tank. The concentrations measured in the extinguishing water did not exceed any of the standard levels, so it was disposed of in the natural environment. Damage to the site was limited: the cladding panels of one workshop were smoke-damaged and the crusher was slightly damaged; the silo can be repaired.

A new weather protection membrane was required in order for the inflatable roof to function correctly again which, in agreement with the insurer, was also ordered in good time. However, owing to supply bottlenecks, high utilisation rates by biogas firms and the need for favourable weather conditions, it was not possible to change the membrane in good time.
As the gas storage membrane was found to be still intact and airtight following an inspection by a specialist firm, it was decided, in consultation with the biogas specialist and the insurance company, to continue operation of the gas storage facility despite the existence of the tear. According to the specialist firm, this was possible if the gas pressure within the gas storage facility was constantly maintained and all three ventilation fans inflating the roof continued in operation.
On this basis, the operator has continued to run the gas storage facility in emergency mode with extra outlay (e.g. increased checks on the hose clamp). No notification was made to the Labour Inspectorate (GAA).
At the time of the incident, a new membrane was already on the premises and the date of installation had been agreed with the company performing the work for 22&nbsp;June 2022.
A few days before the incident, the operator had noticed an increase in gas consumption, however this was not traced back to a possible leak in the gas storage membrane, and instead the amount of input material was increased.
It may be assumed that the ‘increased gas consumption’ was already due to a leak in the gas storage membrane.It may also be assumed that owing to the insufficient internal pressure within the gas storage facility, the gas storage membrane was no longer taut and that there was therefore increased contact with the weather protection membrane.In this context, a static charge could have built up on the membrane surfaces. It is highly likely that this produced a spark which ignited the probable (new) leakage of gas through the gas storage membrane.
Note: The actual cause of the leakage through the gas storage membrane cannot subsequently be established. This may have occurred as a result of the higher internal gas pressure due to early summer temperatures, or as a result of the increased movement of the membrane against the outer membrane close to the metal plate (mechanical damage).","Gas storage facility roof (inflatable roof) completely destroyed. Costs: EUR&nbsp;80,000.","Disconnection of the gas supply, controlled burning off of the biogas. Extinguishing with water.","Even with an irreparable tear (with leakage) in the weather protection membrane alone, the gas storage facility roof (weather protection membrane and gas storage membrane) needs to be completely removed and the gas storage roof must therefore be taken out of operation.
The inappropriate operation of an installation must in principle be considered in a separate risk assessment, in this case, the emergency operation of the gas storage facility and its protection against explosions.The resulting findings and measures must be implemented and followed up by the operator. In this case, increased checks of the edges of the tank and the hose clamp had been laid down as a measure.However, these were obviously insufficient in this case, as regular manual gas measurements in the area of the tear and even a visual inspection of the membrane in the areas concerned were not possible.The only logical measure would have been to take the gas storage facility out of operation."
784,548,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Blast furnace explosion caused by over-pressurisation of the furnace due to the interaction of water and hot molten materials,2001-11-08 17:13:00,2001-11-09 09:00:00,"A blast furnace exploded&nbsp;at approximately 17.13 hours on 8 November 2001. The accident event began with a rapid over-pressurisation of the furnace contents in the bosh area due to the interaction of water and hot molten materials. The immediate effect of this furnace over-pressure was to lift that part of the structure above the lap joint upwards, the furnace lintel rising up off the column heads normally supporting the furnace. It is estimated that the structure above the lap joint rose by some 0.75 m. This structure, with its associated burden, was estimated to weigh around 5000 tonnes. The lifting of the upper part of the furnace left an opening of approximately 400-600 mm around the entire circumference at lap joint level. Gases and hot materials were ejected horizontally from this opening. During the period that this gap remained open, some 200 tonnes of liquid, solid, and semi-solid material were ejected onto the cast house floor. Gaseous material and dust rose into the cast house, exited through various openings in the building and into the atmosphere, where much of it ignited. A cloud of ignited dust and gaseous material was thrown several hundred feet into the air above the furnace. The furnace-top ‘bleeder’ valves also opened and discharged into the atmosphere. Gases from these valves also ignited.The furnace then fell back down vertically as the pressure decreased. During the explosion it had twisted (anticlockwise) through approximately 20–50 mm and moved a distance off-centre of about 100 mm, leaving it supported on the lower lap joint plate, with the lintel mounting positions no longer in contact with the column top flanges but instead some 50–100 mm above the column tops. This meant that the weight of the furnace stack was resting, eccentrically, on the lower lap-joint plate.There was little or no warning to personnel working on the cast house floor, although some witnesses later spoke of the event being preceded by ‘rumbles’ within the furnace moments before the actual explosion. At the time of the explosion there were three employees actually on the furnace stack, and several employees and contractors in the cast house floor area. Three employees were within a few metres of the tap hole, with several in the ‘jump desk’ (control room).For more details, See the full report on the incident&nbsp;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&nbsp;","
The&nbsp;blast&nbsp;furnace exploded due to significant internal overpressure brought about by the interaction of water and molten hot materials within the lower part of the furnace.The explosion occurred after a prolonged attempt - over two days - to recover the furnace from a chilled hearth situation caused by cooling water ingress. The immediate cause was the mixing of water and hot materials within the lower part of the furnace; the precise mechanism remains a matter that is not fully understood.The water had entered the furnace from its cooling system following a chain of events initiated by the failure of safety critical water cooling systems. At the time of the explosion, attempts were continuing to recify the abnormal operating conditions that this had created and to recover the furnace.The precursors to the explosion were a combination of significant failures in health and safety management extending over many years. These failures were not confined solely to the blast furnace plant; they extended elsewhere within the company, and in particular to the Energy Department which supported essential cooling water for the furnace.A failure to carry out suitable risk assessments for blast furnace operations resulted in the failure to implement robust technical and procedural controls. There was insufficient redundancy and security of cooling water supplies, and overall cooling system reliability showed a downward and deteriorating trend over several months.For more details, See the full report on the incident&nbsp;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&nbsp;","
Three employees were killed and 12 employees and contractors&nbsp;sustained severe injuries.Some of the injured&nbsp;remained in intensive care for several months. Their injuries included burns of varying severity,&nbsp;lung damage from the inhalation of hot gases and dust, and serious fractures.&nbsp;Several individuals had very serious burns and multiple injuries of a life-threatening nature. The injuries arose from blast effects, with burns from hot water and steam and the hot gases and dust ejected. Many more suffered minor injuries and shock, and a number of personnel present were subsequently&nbsp;diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Damage was generally limited to the confines of the blast furnace area. The lifting of the furnace body caused considerable disruption to all its services and associated plant. The furnace structure immediately after the accident was no longer supported directly upon its structural columns and was therefore in a potentially unstable condition.&nbsp;Hot materials comprising molten slag, molten iron, partially reacted coke, sinter and unreacted coke, together with larger lumps of agglomerated burden material, had been ejected through the open lap joint&nbsp;damaging the blast wall immediately behind the west side of the furnace. Subsequently, furnace burden penetrated into the water manifold/launder area and into the hydraulic room destroying the water manifold and damaging the wall of the hydraulic room beyond. Penetration of molten burden through a doorway into the amenities block initiated a significant fire which caused serious damage.The profiled steel cladding of the building was severely damaged in several areas, with some sheets being projected in excess of 40 m. Molten slag was thrown over most of the cast house floor and flowed as far as the entrance ramp to an estimated depth of between 300 and 600 mm. There was no penetration of solid material into the control room, although there was impact damage to its front.Areas where gas plant structures had moved significantly were identified after the accident, but gas containment was maintained and there was no major blast furnace gas leakage from the downstream gas system. Significant amounts of flame and gas were, however, emitted through the furnace top bleeders.&nbsp;Subsequent engineering evaluation by&nbsp;engineering personnel deemed the furnace to be beyond repair and it&nbsp;was demolished and rebuilt to a more modern design – one which does not feature a lap joint.Although disruption to the community was relatively minor, with local traffic being affected on the night and local government facilities used as information centres for employees and their relatives, the exposion caused widespread alarm and concern throughout the locality.There was no damage to the environment.The company was subsequently prosecuted under sections 2(1) and 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and was fined £1.33 million, with £1.74 million costs also being awarded.","Following the explosion, the existing site major emergency plan was immediately triggered. After the explosion, the remaining furnace contents were still 'active', and generating large quantities of blast furnace gas comprising mainly carbon monoxide. Within a short time of the event, blast furnace personnel had established a large water seal at the gas system to isolate the furnace from the downstream gas systems. The water supply from the Energy Department was isolated. The furnace was vented through its flare stack and bleeder valves.The on-site and off-site emergency plans were initiated, and Fire, Police and Ambulance services soon had a strong presence on site.The furnace area was cordoned off by the Police to limit access.Control centres were set up at the scene and at Port Talbot Police Station.Local government facilities were used to keep relatives and members of the public informed.Overall emergency response was acceptable, and an early review of the emergency response has generated improvement plans.The structural stability of the furnace and its associated plant was a matter&nbsp;of immediate concern. Following engineering inspection, remedial works were put in hand to ensure stability and safety.The furnace was largely sealed in preparation for 'quenching'. This involved the carefully controlled addition of thousands of tonnes of water to the furnace contents over a period of weeks&nbsp;to halt the internal reactions, stop gas generation, and put the furnace into a safe condition for demolition. Once necessary forensic examinations had been completed, the 'quenched' burden and the refractory materials within the furnace body were removed. The furnace shell was cut into sections and dismantled. The lower bosh and hearth material was essentially solidified and was not finally removed until most of the furnace structure had been dismantled.","
The investigation identified a number of learning points for the company and its blast furnace operations, the wider steel industry, and other manufacturers. These have been communicated to the company and action has followed to make the necessary improvements. Safety managementLesson 1 The company should review the role and function of the Safety Department. It should be better integrated into operational and engineering management.Lesson 2 Blast furnaces are now under the COMAH regime (Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999), where identification and evaluation of major hazards is a legal requirement. Before this, predictive tools and techniques have had relatively limited use within the steel industry. Predictive tools for the assessment and management of risk should receive greater use within the steel industry and other process industries: eg Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS), Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Process Hazard Review (PHR) and Layers of Protection Analysis (LoPA).Cooling waterLesson 3 Sufficient cooling water for furnaces should be available at all times; the supply systems should have an adequate level of reliability built into the system. This reliability should be brought about by good engineering design (including an adequate level of redundancy) and suitable maintenance, and should be monitored to indicate any threats to its integrity.Lesson 4 Reliability engineering techniques should be employed to identify safety-critical plant and appropriate safeguards should be developed from these studies.Lesson 5 Closed systems for furnace cooling water, or systems with equal or better reliability, should be provided wherever reasonably practicable.Leak detectionLesson 6 Speed in locating furnace cooling water leaks is essential. Rapid leak detection relies on good engineering, adequate detection protocols and suitably trained and competent operators. All operators of water-cooled furnaces should ensure that there are adequate measures in place for prompt leak detection.Lesson 7 On water-cooled metallurgical furnaces, where it is reasonably practicable, appropriate instrumentation, specifically designed for leak identification, should be installed to give earlier and more precise detection of leaking cooler elements.MaintenanceLesson 8 Maintenance, inspection and, where appropriate, testing of plant and equipment associated with the reliable delivery of water to furnaces should be paramount. The potential effects of lack of maintenance, inspection and testing in terms of safety should be clearly understood. There should be adequate prior communication between works departments when any maintenance or other work that may potentially affect safe plant operation or reliability is proposed. Formal protocols should be considered for this. Safety-critical items should be identified and protocols and priorities established for their maintenance, inspection and testing.Blast furnace recovery and abnormal plant conditionsLesson 9 The specific process of conducting a blast furnace recovery gives rise to additional risks significantly over and above normal operational risks. It is essential that all personnel involved are aware of those risks and there are control measures in place, including arrangements for effective communication,&nbsp;such that adequate risk control is maintained.Lesson 10 A specific issue with the recovery of the&nbsp;blast furnace was that as it developed, there was an incomplete knowledge of the changing status of the furnace. During abnormal plant conditions there should be a competent senior manager detailed to retain an ‘overview’ of the developing situation and to keep a specific watching brief on critical parameters, so as to be able to inform those more intimately involved in dealing with the abnormal situation. Specific parameters in the case of blast furnace recovery operations should include such critical data as liquid iron levels, hydrogen levels and trends.Management of changeLesson 11 A formal system of pre-modification risk assessments should be instituted for any changes (including changes to operating parameters) proposed to safety-related plant and equipment. This should be coupled with post-modification safety reviews. The management of change system should include evaluation and assessment not only by the engineering and operational functions, but also by appropriately experienced and competent safety professionals. Duties and responsibilities for this should be clearly identified. Changes to the physical characteristics of plant should be carefully assessed for any impact on risk profiles and should be carried out with best engineering practice. All such changes should be carefully recorded and subsequently re-evaluated to determine their actual operational impact.Decision makingLesson 12 In emergency situations, there should be management arrangements such that there is a clear ‘line of responsibility’ for decision making. There should be no doubt whatsoever as to who is making which decisions.Lesson 13 Decisions made by managers under pressure from adverse plant or process conditions present a potential source of significant error. Adequate training and experience is essential, but more precise decision-making protocols should be available for foreseeable circumstances to guide and inform decision making. Careful consideration should be given to providing emergency event simulation training etc to build operator confidence and skills in emergency or abnormal process conditions.Design issuesLesson 14 Opportunities to achieve risk reductions by radical design improvements on blast furnaces are very infrequent. The design of new or extensively rebuilt furnaces should take into account the need to improve the reliability of cooling water supplies and to have suitable pipework layout, valve arrangements and water monitoring systems so as to facilitate prompt leak detection and remedial action.Lesson 15 The provision of improved monitoring systems, purpose-built for monitoring cooling water parameters on blast furnaces, should be considered. Safety-specific instrumentation of adequate precision should be designed and installed to address specific foreseeable operational and abnormal operating conditions.Human factorsLesson 16 It is essential during abnormal plant or process conditions that all personnel are clear as to who is responsible for decision making and that they have provided adequate lines of communication. Employees should have a precise and clear view of their roles and responsibilities, and be supported by suitable training, procedures and other job aids.Lesson 17 The awareness of the danger of water/metal and water/slag explosions should be raised among all employees engaged in processes where this is a risk. The degree of risk presented by molten materials coming into contact with water continues to be not fully appreciated.Lesson 18 The process risks associated with safety-critical plant, especially ageing plant, should be thoroughly understood through rigorous assessment processes, with these being subject to regular review. Specifically, with water systems on blast furnaces, a ‘leakage tolerant’ attitude should not be allowed,&nbsp;especially with older furnaces. Such raised acceptance of water leaks increases the risks of an adverse event occurring at some point.For more details, See the full report on the incident&nbsp;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&nbsp;"

This material contained Reglone, and approximately 2 tonnes of Ethylene Dibromide, both of which are toxic. A batch of Reglone product was being manufactured and had reached the filtration stage. Production had been normal up to this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;The batch&nbsp;was sent from the reactor vessel to the Schenk filter under 6 barg pressure, and the usual sequence is that when the vessel is empty the pressure drops and the pressure indicator in the Schenk filter senses this and sends a message to the process control computer to open the nitrogen valve. The nitrogen is then introduced under pressure to drive the filtration.On this occasion the automated nitrogen valve opened, but the nitrogen pressure did not rise&nbsp;above 2 barg, and a message was sent to the process control computer stating 'Pressure slow in rising'. The operator did not notice this for&nbsp;about 45 minutes due to other duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not an alarm.When the operator&nbsp;saw the message, he sent another operator out to investigate, and he saw that there had been a loss of containment and the batch material had been released through the flange connected to the pressure relief valve. It ran down the side of the vessel, through the lagging and into the site drains.The gasket was protruding through the side of the flange and it is thought it had been blown out when the nitrogen was put on to the filter unit.The joint had been broken at the shutdown about 6 months previously, but the unit had been in operation since then handling around 20 batches per week. The filter unit, and a second&nbsp;identical one, were installed 20 years ago.The main causes for the&nbsp;failure were around the loss of compression on the joint faces and the subsequent displacement of the gasket. The most likely causes were; 1) The use of bolts / studs with different tensile strength causing uneven stretching of the bolts in the flange joint;2) The machined surface finish on the safety valve flange face is not to the correct specification;3) External loading on the joint caused by unsupported pipe work;4) Inherent vibration in the Schenk.The most significant deficiency was considered to be inadequate floor and filter mountings.

Due to the opening of a valve a  release (1102) of liquefied butane occurred from an 6 (6"") inches pipe at the bottom of a 6000 cubic metres (6000 m3) sphere (spherical tank) which was empty end inertised (degasified), with the consequent formation of a liquid pool which evaporated forming a flammable gas cloud which when it reached an ignition point , at approx. 200 metres (20 m), deflagrated producing a pressure wave and thermal radiation (1204). After the deflagration of the cloud, the liquid pool and the product released from the pipe which were ignited (burning) (1203) could be extinguished only 1 hour later, as well as a series of repetitive small fires around all the plant (1999).Meteorological conditions - Precipitation: noneMeteorological conditions - Wind speed: 1.00Meteorological conditions - Wind direction: SEMeteorological conditions - Wind stability: AMeteorological conditions - Temperature: 25.00Meteorological conditions - Remarks: due to the low atmospheric stability and the low wind speed, it appears that the butane (cloud) spread in all those directions it was free to flow instead of being pushed by the windDiscussions about the occurrence: the emergency (occurrence) started at 8:42:39 with the opening of the valve, at 8:48:20 the butane cloud deflagrated; at 8:54:55 the first fire-fighters vehicle arrives, at 10:25:00 the situation is under control (the offsite emergency plan is called off) and at 11:25:00 all emergency plans are deactivated.","The valve (5105) separating a liquid&nbsp; butane line (pipe) with the atmosphere, opened apparently spontaneously (5999).

The fire caused material damage of the turbine air inlet and filterhouse, and the salty water used to extinguish the fire caused damages on electric and mechanical equipment. The LNG production facility has been closed since the accident occured, and was still not reopened by the end of 2021.&nbsp;","Self ignition of filters in the turbine. The self ignition was probably caused by accumulation of biomass (mainly insects) in the air inlet filters. This accumulation caused too high temperatures in the filters over a long period of time, and has probably also caused a change in the self ignition temperature of the hotoil.
The&nbsp; company report states that the incident was not caused by a single technical or human error, but was a result of several direct and underlying causes: design, decisions, operational practices, organisational conditions, conditions related to training, management and control, which together resulted in extensive damage to the plant. The direct cause of the fire was auto-ignition of the filters in the air intake of gas turbine generator no. 4 (GTG4), due to temperatures that were much too high over a long period of time. The underlying cause of the fire was the fact that the anti-ice heat exchanger was used outside its intended area of use, causing this high temperature. The high temperature in the filter housing was not detected.
&nbsp;","The fire caused material damage of the turbine air inlet and filterhouse, and the salty water used to extinguish the fire caused damages on electric and mechanical equipment. The LNG production facility has been closed since the accident occured, and was still not reopened by the end of 2021.&nbsp;There were no injuries during the incident.
The fire has been classified by the company at the highest potential degree of seriousness under slightly different circumstances equal to the actual seriousness of the fire. Slightly different circumstances mean that it is only by chance that alternative outcomes of theincident did not occur, and not what could have happened in a worst-case scenario.&nbsp;
The total cost of this fire is estimated at 8,6 billion Norwegian kroner.","A gas alarm was immediately initiated. The alarm was quickly changed to an evacuation alarm, with a subsequent message over the Public Announcement system to evacuate the plant. Control room operators then initiated emergency shutdown (ESD2), notified the emergency services (triple notification) and started up the plant's active fire protection system (fixed monitors, programmed with oscillation). At the same time as ESD2 was activated, there was a power failure both in the plant and in parts of the nearby town. ESD2 caused all the turbines to lose supply of flue gas, and the power supply to the plant was cut off. This further resulted in the shutdown ofcooling water and instrument air.&nbsp;
The emergency response team (ERT) and incident management team (IMT) mustered in accordance with theinstructions. It was decided to use firefighting vessels to extinguish the fire instead of sending the local Fire Brigade into the plant out of consideration for the safety of the personnel. After these vessels had been in operation, the local&nbsp;fire brigade went into action at about 22.35 and foamed the area. In the emergency log, it is noted that the fire was confirmed extinguished at 23.20.","A wide rage of lessons learned were identified related to:

Owing to repeated start-up of a turbo compressor, a pressure wave caused the opening of a relief valve installed on the pipeline of the chlorine destroyer system, as well as a leakage from the discharge pipeline that entered into the chlorine pumping station, causing the activation of the chlorine sensors located there.A search for the leakage source in the pumping station was undertaken until the chlorine destroyer plant was exhausted. Chlorine was dispersed into the atmosphere through the chimney stack (emission into the atmosphere of about 1500 kg over 18 minutes through a 30 m high stack). Finally, the relief valve was recognized as the cause of the release and it was immediately closed. The concentration of chlorine was measured at the perimeter fence. Observers were sent into the surrounding area that might have been affected by the chlorine cloud in order to ensure that, in case of danger, all windows would be closed.","CAUSES:
The chlorine release occurred because:
1- the relief valve opened when it was not necessary;
2- the position of the relief valve (opened) was not indicated in the control room;
3- the capacity of the chlorine destroyer plant was unknown when the accident occurred;
4- it was not possible to regenerate the chlorine destroyer in a short time when it was exhausted.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 13 people were injured by the toxic release. Outside the establishment 6 people were injured by the toxic release. From the Original Report is not fully clear that it was hospitalizing injuries.ECOLOGICAL HARM:The chlorine release caused damages to the surrounding vegetation  (in the Original Report is not clear whether vegetation was planted or not).Material loss - Remarks: No material losses occurred except the released chlorine.Disruption of community life - Precipitation fog: Observers were sent to the surrounding area that might have been affected by the chloride cloud in order to ensure that, in case of danger, all windows would be closed.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of:       Ecological component: common wild flora/fauna (death or elimination) - Affected 3","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The sensors in the chlorine pumping station activated an alarm.

792,1251,Major Accident,Processing of metals,Fire in a vehicle manufacturer’s medium-voltage switching station,2020-05-16 17:40:00,2020-05-17 00:15:00,"Cause, according to expert opinions:The fire was caused by a fault current with a subsequent electric arc in the area of a cable connector.The source of the fire was located in the raised floor under the installation cabinets. The cables are laid in this raised floor.Power to the installation was shut off before the start of the extinguishing measures.
Access to the installation (roof area) was difficult and took place from two sides: via the nearest stairwell located within the building and via an adjoining roof area (prior to this, it was necessary to evaluate the load capacity of the roof area with regard to staff and material; this was done by specialist facility management staff). Long access routes (laying a total of 5 km of hose lines).
The space inside the raised floor is very limited (1.2 m in height). The fire was extinguished via the openings in the upper part of the raised floor, using the fire-fighting hoses brought in.At first, CO2 was used for the extinguishing process. This was unsuccessful. Then, the raised floor was flooded with water.&nbsp; This was also unsuccessful, because the raised floor has holes in it, and so the water pumped in did not remain within the raised floor area, but drained out into the areas below.Then foam was used, which led to the fire being extinguished successfully. The firefighters had to manually move the foaming agent (individual canisters) onto the roof and into the stairwell (which was time-consuming) in order to feed it into the fire-fighting hoses.
Safety measures:Activation of the smoke detector in the raised floor; furthermore, the radiation detectors in the medium-voltage switching station activated an alarm. Immediate notification of the on-site fire brigade and of facility management.Before carrying out extinguishing measures: Shutting off power to the installation and to the battery system located within the installation by specialist facility management staff (duration: approx. 1 h).Complete disconnection of the energy provider’s supply cable.","Cause, according to expert opinions: The fire was caused by a fault current with a subsequent electric arc in the area of a cable connector.

Evacuation of personnel was not necessary – this took place during the weekend and no staff or any other persons were present in the area. The danger zone was localised.Power to the installation was promptly shut off. The damaged area was cordoned off after the fire had been successfully extinguished.
Off-site: The fire brigade took air measurements around the location, testing for harmful substances (using a measuring equipment vehicle belonging to the Groß-Gerau central office). No harmful substances were detected (the measurement results are available in the on-site fire brigade area).In the area of a neighbouring settlement, a burnt smell could be detected, which was classified as non-harmful on the basis of the measurement results.Both the on-site fire brigade incident command and the management of the Rüsselsheim fire brigade determined that there was no detriment or danger to the public or to the surrounding neighbourhood. Therefore, no action was taken to alert the residents or the surrounding neighbourhood (for example using the hessenWARN app).
The damaged area was cordoned off. A cleaning company removed the accumulated quenching water by means of a vacuum vehicle and transferred it to wastewater engineering. Following a total loss, the installation is being stripped down by a specialist company.
There was no environmental damage.Checks on water channels were stepped up and incoming water was redirected to a retention pond. The measurement results were normal (no harmful airborne emissions).
The on-site fire brigade requested two firefighting units and the measuring equipment vehicle.In extinguishing the fire, the on-site fire brigade received support from the volunteer fire brigade.The measurements were carried out using the measuring equipment vehicle.","The Facility Management’s Medium Voltage Section checked all the medium-voltage stations on site for fire safety. Minor shortcomings were detected during the checks:

Release of hydrogen sulphide in a zinc dithiophosphate plant,2010-07-17 01:25:00,2010-07-17 03:12:00,"On 17 July 2010 a pipeline compensator in an oil terminal broke down while a ship was being unloaded.
A mixture of hydrocarbons (C5-C6 paraffin) of approx. 80 t was discharged. As it is a highly flammable substance, it was immediately covered with a foam carpet. Approx. 17.8 t of the amount discharged was soaked up; approx. 1.7 t evaporated into the air and approx. 5.3 t were skimmed off by the end of October 2010. The remaining amount (approx. 55 t) in the soil was siphoned off over a longer period of time using four skimming wells. The ship was loaded with approx. 500 t of the aforementioned liquid. After the entire pipeline had been checked by the operator's staff, samples of the liquid had been taken and analysed, and the routine unloading processes had been discussed with the ship’s master, the unloading process began around 01:30.
The ship's pump was started at a capacity of 50 m3/h and a pressure of 1.5 bar. Around 01:45, the ship's pump broke down twice, for reasons that are still unknown. At 02:45 the operator's employee had the capacity increased to 100 m3/h. As the estimated tank content differed significantly from the actual tank content, at around 03:10 the operator moved away from the pipeline route and observed a large organic liquid pool.
At around 03:12 the employee halted the unloading of the ship.
","The cause of the discharge was identified as a rupture around the entire circumference of a port pipeline compensator through which the highly flammable liquid flowed into a pipeline transportation system. The failure of the ship’s pump, the reasons for which could not be identified, led to a hydraulic pressure surge in the pipeline. Since the compensators fitted are not suitable for this application and there was no fixed point between two compensators, the compression/extension acting on the compensators was not clearly defined. The system was thus insecure. The result was a rupture around the entire circumference of one compensator and damage to the adjacent compensator.
","Material damage: Compensator in pipeline
Environmental damage: Soil contamination
Total costs for removal and clean-up approx. €480 000.
","On-site:
Liquid covered with foam and then captured using a vacuum vehicle. Off-site:
Preventive measurements taken by the voluntary fire brigade (results: negative, i.e. no emissions could be detected externally).
-	Ship unloading immediately halted.
-	On-site fire brigade alerted.
-	The liquid discharged was covered with foam to prevent it from evaporating into the atmosphere.
-	The liquid was then captured using a vacuum vehicle.
","Immediate actions: increased patrols 1.	Updating and review of the loading and unloading rules for company personnel, outside personnel and the ship’s masters.
2.	Drawing up a plan for safe filling, operating and emptying of the pipeline, and designing to prevent water hammer.
3.	Designing loose and fixed points for the loading and unloading pipelines in connection with the fitting of compensators for the port pipelines.
4.	Updating and review of inspections together with the design office and with representatives of the compensator manufacturers.

An explosion and a fire occurred in one of the workshops of the plant.Chronology of the event:- 6:30 h:&nbsp; the operation&nbsp; started - 30 min before shift end.- 6:45 h:&nbsp; the temperature threshold was reached - the operators started to cool the reactor in order to maintain the temperature around 65°C- the reaction ran away : the temperature and the pressure rose in the vessel.- The operator nearest to the reactor smelled an unpleasant odour. Through the sight glass he saw a glow preceding the explosion. Employees at 15 m distance perceive a blow. A flame projected through the workshop, other flames shot out from a joint and other damaged connections of the reactor. Employees outside&nbsp; the building perceived a blow just before the explosion. A flame several metres high was visible for some seconds at the exit of a chimney connected with the reactor rupture disk (calibrated at 0.5 bar) that burst, allowing the decompression of the reactor.","The synthesis operation had already been performed several times over 2 years.A material balance has demonstrated that the flow of imide compound transferred in the reactor was 8 to 9 times higher than foreseen. The operators could control this flow by regulating the number of pulsations of the dosing pump by means of a regulating screw and by acting on two manual valves located upstream of the pump. After the accident,&nbsp; the dosing&nbsp; pump was found to be regulated for a high flow and the two upstream manual valves were completely open.The reduction of an imide compound by sodium tetrahyddroborate in an ""ether"" type solvent medium is a hazardous reaction. Sodium tetrahyddroborate and Aluminium trichloride can decompose in presence of water, even if in trace quantities, forming eventually hydrochloric acid or hydrogen.When the accident occurred significant quantities of hydrogen were formed by the runaway reaction and were not absorbed by the reaction medium. The ignition of the gas may have been caused by static electricity in the reactor, a hot spot or&nbsp; the presence of diborane and water traces.The process instructions did not consider the flow regulations to be performed during transfer&nbsp; operations. These flow regulations were left to the know-how of the operators.The workers who were working at the reactor when the accident occurred were experienced with the exception of the worker who performed&nbsp; the imide compound transfer for the first time.The unit worked discontinuosly and was essentially operated manually. Considering the hazards releated to the reaction, the equipment has to be absolutely reliable and there has to be enough personnel to control the functioning of the equipment in completely safe conditions. These conditions were not guaranteed the day of the accident because:- 2 pumps with different flow capacity could be used for transfer operation, but&nbsp; no flow control meter was provided.- there were no safety or devices to alert the operators in case of a drift of the operating parameters (high flow, high pressure in the reactor,)- the unit was not equipped with remote control valves allowing the reactors to be isolated rapidly. The reactors could not be discharged rapidly, a ""neutralisation of the reacting medium was impossible.- the installation was brittle due to glass components.","4 of 8 persons present in the workshop were burned or suffered from respiratory problems and were hospitalised.

Fine weather with a moderate West-North-Wet wind.

A rapid exothermic reaction of fertilizers occurred within a dryer giving rise to a rapid decomposition of the bulk of the material. The decomposition of the fertilizers resulted in the evolution and dispersion of toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides and, probably, of chlorine.
There had been no previous incidents relating to bulk decomposition of fertilizers at this plant although there had been decomposition of small amounts of fertilizers resting on hot surfaces throughout the life of the plant (30 years).","CAUSES:
The production of a fertilizer with cigar-burning or self-sustaining decomposition 
properties, combined with an overheating of the material as it was being re-cycled through the dryer and with the stopping of the dryer for examination, gave rise to a rapid decomposition of the bulk of the material, resulting in the evolution of toxic fumes.
The combination of blended fertilizers containing single and triple super-phosphates with a mixture of NPK fertilisers gave rise to a combined fertiliser which had the property of self-sustaining decomposition. This is thought to be due to the unexpected presence of a high contents of insoluble phosphates. Whilst passing through the dryer, the temperature of the product rose to about 130oC causing a rapid exothermic reaction within the dryer with evolution of toxic fumes.The operator intervened by stopping the dryer when the temperature became so high that it created concern. Then a rapid exothermic reaction occurred within the dryer, resulting in the evolution of toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides (and, probably, of chlorine). There had been no previous accidents relating to bulk decomposition of fertilizers at this plant, although there had been decomposition of small amounts of fertilizers resting on hot surfaces throughout the life of the plant (30 years). The plant was in a large multi-floor building (approximately 50m x 50m and 30m high) containing two compound fertilizers production plants. Each plant included conveyor and elevator feed systems with raw material hoppers and weighing systems. These systems were connected to a blunger or mixer and into a 30m x 5m diameter rotary drier, thence by off-take conveyors and elevators to a finishing plant. The production process converted the mixture of fertilizers products from a loose to a granular form.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 1 person was killed and 6 injured by the toxic release inside the establishment. Outside the establishment 12 people were injured by the toxic release. About 10,000 people outside the establishment were affected by the accident&nbsp; (this number has to be considered as indicative).MATERIAL LOSS:Damages to the duct-work associated with the fume extraction system and subsequent damages to the hydraulic lubrication system were caused by the fire.

The centrifuge's lid was blown up by the force of the explosion. The overpressure shattered nearby glass pipelines and windows inside the process area (up to 20 metres away) but nearby plants were not damaged. As no operator was in the vicinity at the time of the explosion, no one was injured.
","CAUSES:
The following investigation revealed a number of factors which could have contributed to the explosion. No nitrogen inerting was used and enough time was elapsed to allow sufficient air could have been drawn into the machine to create a flammable atmosphere. Sufficient heat could also have been generated by friction to raise the temperature of the solvent medium above its flash-point. The investigation also showed that the Teflon coating on the centrifuge's basket was worn away. Metal-to-metal contact between the basket and the bottom outlet chute of the centrifuge could have caused a friction spark and it was the most probable source of ignition even if continuity checks failed to eliminate the possibility that a static discharge occurred.
","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:As no operator was in the vicinity at the time of the explosion, no one was injured.MATERIAL LOSS:The lid of the centrifuge was blown-off by the force of the explosion and the overpressure shattered nearby glass pipelines and windows inside the process area (up to 20 metres away) but nearby plants were not damaged. The amount of the damage has been evaluated at about 0.006M Euros.Affected Area: installation","No emergency measures were taken, neither on-site nor off-site.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the company has been requested to use nitrogen inerting when centrifuging highly flammable liquids at all temperatures."
804,631,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion and fire of a hydroxylamine solution re-distillation column,2000-06-10 18:08:00,2000-10-10 23:10:00,"A re-distillation column (reduced-pressure distillation, the operation temperature 50#) for a 50% aqueous solution of hydroxylamine exploded, and a fire occurred. The re-distillation column blew up leaving no traces, and there was blast damage to surrounding houses in a 1.5 km radius. The factory was completely destroyed. Damage outside the factory was also great. The traffic on a nearby national road was stopped temporarily by smoke and harmful gas generated by the fire. ","A highly concentrated hydroxylamine aqueous solution causes explosive decomposition by itself or by reacting with a ferrous ion. At the re-distillation column bottom, hydroxylamine was concentrated to 80-85%, and was circulated in the middle of the column. A crude 50% solution of hydroxylamine was charged into the circulating high-concentration hydroxylamine. Then the hydroxylamine solution was heated to evaporate some part of the hydroxylamine. Next, in the column, 50% hydroxylamine vapor went to the top of the column and a 80% hydroxylamine solution dropped to the bottom. As a ferrous ion contained in feedstock at about 50 ppb is reduced to 1 ppb or less in the product, part of the circulation liquid was drawn out from the bottom circulation line. Emergency blow-down piping was installed at the underside of the bottom circulation piping to draw out column fluid in an emergency, and a block valve was installed just apart from the branching point. Very short piping from the branch to the block valve was dead-end piping. The major cause is as follows: A very small amount of ferrous ions in the circulation liquid dropped to the dead-end piping, and accumulated gradually. The accumulated iron caused exothermic decomposition, and detonation was propagated from the re-distillation column bottom. ","Human: four persons died and 58 person got injured.Factory: four buildings were destroyed by fire, nine buildings collapsed, two buildings partially collapsed. Outside factory: two buildings collapsed, five buildings partially collapsed, 286 buildings were damaged. 55 vehicles and machines were damaged. A high-voltage line was disconnected for several hours. A telephone line was damaged. The traffic on a nearby national road was stopped temporarily by smoke and harmful gas generated by the fire. ","Neither fire fighting nor evacuation was carried out, since only momentary explosion occurred.","As highly concentrated hydroxylamine is very hazardous, it is used or transported after being diluted. It is not designated as a dangerous material under the fire protection law if the concentration is 15% or less. When hazardous facilities are constructed, regulations that are the same as those for explosives are needed of protective barriers, a safety distance, open spaces, etc., and they should be constructed in a safe place.

It was due to be replaced in September. As a result the other two are used.&nbsp;- a second one, which had been working for 18 months, started to malfunction. Several efforts were made to resolve the situation but overall it continued to produce excessive releases.&nbsp;- the third one, overloaded, also started to release excessive quantities.&nbsp;- from the 3rd August, the releases to the environment are substantial.&nbsp;- by the 8th August, the treatment works was no longer functioning properly: the effluent was not being filtered, nor was the biological treatment working.The situation was aggravated by poor communications between the fire service and the inspectors: the fire service were collecting dead fish before the inspectors knew of the incident. It was therefore only 4 days later that the operator stopped operations.","More than 20 km. of river were polluted, killing the fauna and a part of the flora. Deposits of mud on the river bed were found over some 20 km. 7 tonnes of dead fish were collected. The pollution, already serious, was made worse by the decomposition of other dead fish, not yet collected.","The fire services removed the dead fish. The operator, required to find another means to dispose of his effluent, at first distributed them round several urban sewage works. The cost is estimated at more than 300,000 Euros. The operator was required to restore correct operation.

","It is worth noting that the plan was to construct in 2000 a buffer basin between the physico-chemical treatment and the biological. Such a buffer basin would in this case have avoided the overload and subsequent malfunctioning of the treatment works.
It is important to ensure that environmental factors are taken into account better by the operators of installations like this one, where a small enterprise can produce severe local pollution.
Finally, better communication would have reduced the total amount of pollution, since the measures taken to shut down the installation would have been taken sooner.

808,481,Major Accident,Plastic and rubber manufacture,Large fire in a factory producing glues and mastic resins,2000-12-08 10:00:00,2000-12-08 00:00:00,"A large fire developed in a factory producing glues and mastic resins. To date, the installation has not been classified as a Seveso establishment. Nevertheless, the accident, which caused major material damage and a considerable stir in public opinion, was found to be interesting with regard to the aspect of emergency management. For a long time there were concerns about possible air pollution.The event is classified as level 5 of the gravity scale (the number of persons who had to be confined during the emergency response operations, about 30,000&nbsp; relates to level 5, while the cost of material damage relates to level 4)Therefore, the accident is not relevant for the MARS database, and because of this reason it is notified in the context of the OCDE database (other events) However, it would fulfill the criteria of Annex VI, if the latter was applicable. ","The fire was probably started by an electrostatic discharge during the solvent transfer. The pallet truck was not earthed, and the worker's shoes were not anti-static. Therefore, earth contact was not assured. The worker's initial panic and the very fast development of the fire made any response action by the employees impossible; the employees left the workshop within a few minutes.

","The effects on the environment were minor: The analysis of the smoke within 100 m of the fire showed that very close to the fire the hydrochloric acid concentration was 4 ppm, while the benzene concentration was 100 ppm. The health inspection did not detect any case of intoxication. As there was no capacity for retention, part of the water used for fire fighting (1800 m3) flowed off into the sewage network, without compromising the functioning of the sewage treatment plant, which was warned in good time. The results of ground and water analysis did not reveal any significant pollution.

The material damage, of about 10.67 Million Euros (10.570.000 euros), was major: plastics (mainly PVC), solvents (toluene and xylene) and the finished products (packaged polyurethane mastics and glues) constitute the principal part of the materials involved in the fire. The MDI storage and the drums in the processing area were protected by the fire-walls and thus were not affected by the fire.","The emergency services react quickly. A large plume of black smoke develops and partially touches the nearby urbanised zone. Since the meteorological situation was not favourable for the rising and the dispersion of the plume, the emergency services ask the population to remain inside the buildings. The event is abundantly covered by the media because of the broadcasting of the directions for confinement by the local radios. Three schools located in the direction of the plume are evacuated. The fire is under control after 2h 30 min. The confinement measures are suspended around 13:30, since the fire has been extinguished. The emergency services keep monitoring the situation during the whole of the following day.After the fire was extinguished, a number of measures were taken to ensure a follow-up:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Protective Measures:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Inspection of all installations and&nbsp; assessment of the operational conditions of the site (administrative and regulatory situation),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Prefect's decree prohibiting the resumption of activities and prescribing clean-up - waste storage -&nbsp; and waste removal - measures to be carried out,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Health-related measures:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Consultation of 360 doctors on the health-related consequences of exposure to the smoke,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Environmental measures:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A monitoring campaign of the ground and of vegetation in the area affected by the accident,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Monitoring analysis of the extinguishing water originating from the fire fighting, of the sewage water and of the water in the sewage treatment plant.The following results were obtained:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * With respect to health and the environment, the impact was minor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * At the time of the accident, the company was operating the plant in a way that anticipated the authorisations that had been applied for. (specifically, increase of the quantities of stored MDI)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The inspection of the installations has highlighted the absence of a system for the retention of extinguishing water, as well as an inadequate delivery rate of fire-fighting water, the fact that waste was stored without any containment system and exposed to the atmosphere, and the fact that an incomplete file had been submitted when applying for authorisation.","With regard to technical aspects:The fire-walls and the emergency services response operation allowed the accident to be kept adequately under control, but the fire-wall's efficacy was compromised by the presence of the sky-dome too close to it. It is important to consider the risk of ignition of elements that can melt when heated and which can compromise the efficacy of protection devices such as fire-walls.AdministrationThe applications for authorisation of installations already in use must be the object of formal notices, according to Article L514-2 of the environmental Law.In hazard studies, it is imperative to describe the substances that may be formed by decomposition during a fire, and to evaluate the consequences, in order to adjust the prevention, protection and response measures.Crisis management:The event had an extensive media coverage through the broadcasting by the local radios of the confinement instructions,&nbsp; information which was picked up by the national radios. A large number of press organisations immediately sent reporting teams to the site; they arrived before any overview of the situation could be obtained and even before any real operational command post could be set up. This almost instantaneous media coverage of the event created a strong pressure of information demand on all those involved in the response operations, even before the establishment of structures for co-ordination and for the collection of reliable information on the event and its consequences.As an accident occurs, the emergency services must prioritise the following two main aspects of crisis management:*&nbsp; The mobilisation and the up-grading of the system for immediate emergency response*&nbsp; The activation of the co-ordination and command structure, in order to facilitate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The drawing up of a preliminary overview of the situation and the correct assessment of the event;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The activation of a structured system for gathering and recovering verified information;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Control of the spreading of the warning after the event.The last point can be achieved only by the activation of an operational command post on the site and of a crisis management team in an operational command room of the prefecture.

As a result 50 tons of butane escaped.,"Human cause, unclear markings caused confusion on whether the valve was open or shut.A temporary employee, who had only been working in the company since a short period of time, first of all CLOSED the valve under supervision of his mentor. After a while the temporary employee returned without his mentor. Since he had doubts if the valve was really closed he turned it a second time. At that time he thought he closed it, but in fact with this action he OPENED valve again activating the alarm. He then decided to turn the valve a third time. Now the valve was CLOSED. What he did not know was that there is always a (minor) delay in the decrease of pressure in the pipeline because of which the alarm bells continue to go off for a short time.Some background information: The pipeline is some hundred meters long and&nbsp; there is still some pressure on the pipe immediately after changes in the valves. In other words there is always a certain delay when closing the pipe due to which the pressure appears high in a small part of the pipeline. One has to take this delay into account.He then asked for assistance of the mentor. (The mentor had not been present when the temporary employee had opened and closed&nbsp; the valve a couple of times.) They decided to turn the valve a fourth time thinking it would close it, but actually OPENING it. And -most importantly- they turned off the alarm. Not taking into account the alarm had only went off because of the delay in the pipe line. To sum up, the status of the valve when they left was 'OPEN' and the alarm bells did NOT go off since they had been turned off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did this confusion about opening or closing the valve occur? Two years prior to this accident a similar accident had happened. The correction that was applied after that accident was the following: a warning sign with the word 'OPEN' was placed over the valve (in other words it covered the valve). However, in a closed situation the warning sign showed the word 'open' and in an open situation the sign showed the word 'open' as well. The only difference was that in an open situation the word 'open' was read vertically and in a closed situation horizontally. Hence, the improvement/correction that was made due to the accident that had happened 2 years before caused even more confusion for someone that did not know the practical reason behind it. This 'opening and closing' should have been noticed in BP's control room, but did not result in any action since the alarm had been turned off (see above). ","The release of butane caused material loss for the owner of the plant, but no cost data availableIn total approximately 55 people at risk (establishment population and emergency personnel)Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",An external company was present/was working at the site in December 23rd 2003. Approximately at 5am they heard a noise and noticed that butane was escaping. Because of a heavy storm they did not hear the escape of butane before that time. The external company warned the BP- people present resulting in a shut down of the machinery. BP people contacted the firebrigade (external service) who did a gas detection measurement. Official action taken - legal action: The company is situated in the province of Noord- Holland in the Netherlands. The province has undertaken judicial action against the company. In 2004 this resulted in a settlement with the public attorney.Official action taken - other official action: A technical investigation by the labour Inspectorate concerning the cause of the accident and the measures taken. ,"Measures to prevent recurrence:

813,615,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Blast in an herbicide production plant,2000-02-19 01:58:00,2000-02-19 05:00:00,"The accident occurred at the PENDIMETHALIN (active principle for the selective herbicide) production plant. The process comprises 4 steps:Step 1 - mononitrationStep 2 - reductive alkylation of 4-nitroxyleneStep 3 - dinitration of the intermediateStep 4 - purification and washing of the Pendimethalin.The accident occurred during step 3 in the nitric acid concentration section and involved the distillation column C320 and the dedicated reboiler E320, connected to the column by natural circulation.The cause of the accident is still under investigation by the competent judicial authorities; however, based on the declarations of the company, it can be supposed that the event initiated with the bursting of the bottom of the distillation column and the reboiler connected to the same column. The blast wave consequent to the explosion hurled one of the two road tankers parked nearby on a second road tanker. The road tanker hurled by the blast wave contained nitric acid with a ca. 40% concentration, resulting from the purging of the column bottom, whereas the road tanker which was hit was empty. The projection of missiles on the plant structures consequent to the explosion caused among other consequences, also cracks on the tank containing nitric acid and its release. A fire developed also affecting only the immediate surroundings of the explosion within a radius of a few metres, according to an estimate based on the effects left by the flames. According to the estimates of the company, the smoke column produced by the fire reached a height of 20 metres and&nbsp; shifted towards a nearby highway. The process substances and residues which were released by the explosion, were subsequently washed away by the extinguishing water used by the Finchimica fire brigade and were collected in the final emergency containment basin, with a capacity of ca. 1.600 m= (1400m= were collected following the accident), the plant personnel put the basin immediately into service for the successive treatment in the sewage treatment plant. During the collecting phase of the extinguishing water in the basin, a not perfectly closed interception valve allowed a certain amount of the extinguishing water to leak into the municipal sewage system and from there into an open air channel named ""colatore Moloncello"". Tests have been performed on samples taken from the affected water systems and the results are still under evaluation by the competent territorial authorities: however, from what is known to the company, there is no visible damage to the surrounding flora.","The causes of the accident are under investigation by the state attorney office of Brescia which has also ordered the sequestration of the installation.While waiting for the official results of the investigations (carried out both by the attorney of the state and the company itself), from the results of the interviews with the company and considering the fact that the operator&nbsp; observed a sudden rise of the pressure over the measurable range of the instrumentation immediately before the explosion, it is reasonable to assume a run-away reaction as cause of the accident.","From what is known to the company nobody has been affected directly by the accident and there is no evidence of health consequences either on-site or off-site.
Concerning environmental consequences, the damages are mainly due to the limited spill in the sewage system as described before and are under evaluation by the competent territorial authorities (ASL, etc.).
The fire  caused the release of combustion products in the atmosphere deriving from the combustion of the process liquids and the coatings of the surrounding buildings. Concerning the evolution of the released combustion gases, the ASL, which intervened on a call of the 118 emergency response service, established, as declared in its report, the ""absence of a continuous diffusion of combustion gases in the atmosphere"".
Technicians of the SOPI (Operative Structure for Emergency Response of the ASL) carried out the necessary tests ""excluding the presence in the atmosphere of nitric acid, combustion gases as COx, NOx, SOx, hydrocyanic acid, and all other organic substances with a xylene infrared absorption spectrum.
The ASL itself has taken waste water samples (processing water, extinguishing water, etc.) for analysis; the results are under evaluation by the competent authorities.
Concerning material damage, the accident caused on-site consequences as well as off-site consequences.
On-site the installation:
- ""building 1 and 2"" with damage to equipment and structures,
- the two road tankers affected by the blast wave and missile projection are out of service,
- the control room of the office building with damages to the external walls, windows, and in the control room damage to the ceiling panelling.
In a more detailed way, in the control room windows and ceiling panelling were damaged by the pressure wave. The external walls were damaged by missiles projections of structural elements from buildings 1 and 2.
The largest metal fragment found weighs 120-130 kg.
A missile  pierced the external metallic fence of the liquid hydrogen storage tank located ca. 60 m from the explosion point, without damaging the tank itself because it was shielded by building 2. Moreover the blast wave, which  expanded mostly on the N-S axis which was not protected by large buildings  reached also, apart from the already mentioned control room, the laboratory building and the management office building some 150 m away, causing the rupture of windows in both of them.
Off-site, within a radius of 400 m, a few buildings were affected by rupture of windows and some missile projection. Metallic fragments were found onsite within a radius of 100 m and some others over the enclosure wall within a distance of 40-60 m from the wall (perforations with a maximum size of some dozen cm).
In a more detailed way concerning off-site consequences, using the establishment as orientation point:
- eastwards, highway and mainly agricultural land, no damage has been reported until now.
- northwards, two farm buildings, the first at a distance of 120 m, suffered broken windows, whereas the second, at a distance of 220 m, did not suffer any damage.
- westwards, some private buildings and some installations being part of the industrial area, broken windows were reported.

Operators closed the tank and bund drain valves preventing loss to the surrounding environment. The supervisor observed that there was a v-shaped dip in the edge of the floating roof from which gasoline was leaking on to the roof through the damaged rim seal and contacted the emergency response team.","Damaged rim seal. A v-shaped dip in the edge of the floating roof, allowed loss of hydrocarbon mixed with rainwater down drain line.",Hydrocarbon mixed with rainwater was released into the annular ring drain around the bottom of the tank and bund. THis was recovered. There were significant unignited evaporative losses to atmosphere.,"Initially the on site emergency response team applied foam via the fixed rim seal pourers and deployed foam cannons on the surface of the tank. An exclusion zone was set up to prevent ignition of the flammable vapour from the surface of the tank and exposure to toxic substances in naptha. However, foam application was stopped due to concerns about it causing static ignition. The Incident Management Team decided that the safest option to prevent fire was to remove gasoline by displacement with water through the roof drain to another tank. In all 1349 tonnes were recovered without injury to persons on site and contaminated water and hydrocarbon is being treated prior to disposal. Allowing the foam blanket to disperse resulted in significant evaporative losses to atmosphere of 4564 tonnes. This is in excess of the reportable quantity of 5% of the top tier threshold for gasolines and naphthas of 25000 tonnes namely 1250 tonnes (COMAH Schedule 1 Part 2).","The company considered the design code of t453 and the specific gravity of product < 0.6, they identified other tanks under similar duty. Prioir to failure they had exceptionally high localised rain fall (42mm) and considered the design of the roof drains in relation to removing water from the roof.  the drain ran diagonally from the roof to the bottom of the tank they looked at how the weight of water filling the drain could potentially drag the roof down,  they found no evidence to support this hypothesis. They discussed the dismantling of the tank, considering the roof was deformed and their concerns re: unzipping of the tank - Petroineos contracted Das Fleet (a dutch demolition company with experience of this type of work) Outcomes of their inspection of the damaged tank were that it was likely a combination of multiple causes all contributing to the partial collapse of the roof: Likely Scenarios: Crease in roof was 1m in depth24hrs prior to failure 42mm of rain fell they considered drain restriction as above - however when tested the non return drain valve was functioning as designed. no obvious damage to roof drain, at time of incident the roof drain was free running, Drain size for the service was also considered - Petroineos stated that there was no reason to assume the drain was inadequately sized. Roof drain design: roof drain runs inside of tank as the tank roof lists the angle of the drain pipe is changed leading to the drain being compromised and unable to drainwater from the roof effectively potentially leading to rainwater/product building up on roof increasing the roof loading and potentially contributing to the roof sinking through loss of bouancy.Petroineos stated that there was no evidence for this under normal operation. Build up of product?No evidence of the roof material being penetrated. the roof was designed and manufactured by Motherwell Bridge circa 1960s to the standard in force at that time. All future refurb will be taken in line with current standards. Tank 453 was originally on Benzine duty (sg:0.6)  the tank functioned as designed on this service for 30-40 years without incident. Petroineos considered other tanks on their site under similar duty (1950s/60s design originally on higher s.g product then changing to lower s.g product) no issues on any other tank were found. No product placed in the tank was above normal operating temperatures, (stabalised gasoline is lighter and flashes off vapour at a higher rate when heated) There was no evidence of this. Roof Distorted/Tipped? Vapour lock? can't be ruled out, but no evidence to support this. Petroineos stated: not a credible scenario as temperature of product was not above normal operating tolerances.Roof Jamming - no evidence of this.Overplating of roof at area which failed? - they discovered 30 plus tonne of metal plating on the area that failed -  no evidence that roof was not performing within normal operating thresholds.. No wind loading Pontoon ring - not stiff enough? Petroineos stated that they had not been able to confirm details with regards to significant flexion of roof - however, they did not model for this. Age profile of roof: not a contributing factor; Going forward Training for individuals who inspect water levels on tank roof, the tank roof is esigned to withstand 10"" of standing water on the roof with product at a s.g of 0.7.   they have not calculated failure modes to identify max rain water on tank roof holding stab gas at sg 0.6. Roof design - discussion being held with management on current design standards, standard inspections and bouancy checks being introduced to training sessions. Maintenance - WSE being revised, integrity of pontoons (inspection of pontoon holes to be completed by end of year) Management of change - operating envelopes now in place, ops team to identify any changes: operational checks;visual inspection;Identify abnormal conditions;Training for ops Overall:Company has not been able to identify one significant contributing factor leading to failure, they consider that the swiss cheese model of multiple contributing failure modes maybe the most credible/likely scenario. they state that they have learned valuable lessons around maintenance and reviewing the integrity of their tanks.    "
818,819,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Release of natural gas from two water-sealed un-staffed gas holders,1987-10-21 21:00:00,1987-10-21 00:00:00,"The un-staffed site contained two water-sealed gas holders which received and delivered natural gas via a volume governor. The levels of gas in the holders were monitored in the remote control station by means of pressure indicators. Each holder had an automatic valve which was operated by a high and low-level trip via pilot gas connections containing poppet valves. During the severe gales in the early hours of October 16, one holder descended from a full position above high knock-off level to a position just below the knock-off level. In descending, the holder failed to operate the high knock-off valve correctly (it is assumed that this was due to wind pressure). During late afternoon of October 21 (five days later) the reducing ambient temperature caused the stock in both holders to fall. At approximately 20:00 the holder descended low enough to operate the change over poppet and the automatic holder valve opened. The ascending holder should have operated the change over poppet again and in the situation which prevailed the holder valve should have closed, but this failed to occur. It is assumed that this poppet valve dwelled in a mid point position. This allowed gas to pass from one holder into the other. The knock-off arm being in the incorrect position was damaged by the striker arm on its upward travel. Gas continued to pass into the holder when it was full and began to discharge via the ground level water seal. The high alarm was registered at the regional control room and an emergency team was sent to the site. Gas continued to leak for about one hour but it was not ignited. Gas leaked from one side of the seal which was about 4 metres from the boundary fence, about 5 metres from gardens of private houses and about 15 metres from the houses themselves.","CAUSES:
The accident occurred because of the failure of two poppet valves that allowed the overfilling of a gas holder. One poppet valve failed to operate correctly due to the severe wind conditions. The second poppet valve failed to operate failed to operate correctly due to an abnormal friction within its bearing surfaces causing it to dwell in an intermediate position, allowing gas to discharge from  one holder to the other.

An expert assessment has since also ruled out a causal link between the electrical installation and the fire.
Based on the facts, the operator assumes that the spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose (NC) material cannot be ruled out as a chemically possible cause.This must have resulted in a fire in the storage chamber, which then transformed into a deflagration reaction.The deflagration reaction from the gunpowder blew off the roof of the warehouse bunker, designed to act as a decompression area.
Fragments from the building and the warehouse were scattered over a radius of up to around 50&nbsp;m. Individual projected items were discovered around 100&nbsp;m away in the industrial area.
Safety functions:The impact remained within the legally defined hazard range and the pre-calculated protection and safety margin.
According to in-house and police investigations, after the reaction the affected area posed no entry hazard. Apart from the area’s temporary closure, no urgent security action was required.The following measures could not have impacted on the incident itself.","The complete destruction of the building and facilities meant that the investigation had to be conducted by process of elimination (see triggers/process).
Spontaneous combustion of nitrocellulose (NC) material.","A storage building was destroyed, another suffered damage to its roller shutters and sections of wall, and there were glass breakages in several farm buildings.
Three instances of glass breakages were reported from a neighbouring locality.
Soil contamination in the immediate vicinity. No lasting/long-term damage expected.Concrete bunker sole, walls and roof pierced. Earth covering of the building and ejected non-combusted stored goods deposited in the immediate vicinity.
Three instances of glass breakages reported from a neighbouring locality.","
Following the reaction, the entire vicinity was sealed off over a wide area and an investigation conducted while applying appropriate protective measures (armoured vehicle, protective clothing, drone flight). In consultation with the police, the danger zone was delimited and eventually all areas made safe to enter.
The plant’s fire service and the regular fire service, in cooperation with the police, sealed off and secured the area and provided fire protection.
The plant’s fire service extinguished wildfires in the immediate vicinity.
On the day of the accident, initially all operations were stopped completely. The early shift was stood down; the late shift resumed operations.
The affected area is situated on premises protected by a double fence and under electronic surveillance. No further precautionary action was required.
The area outside the operational area was initially secured by the police. Following the inspection, this area was deemed safe to enter and re-opened.
In consultation with the police, on the day of the accident the area surrounding the storage building was cleared of recoverable materials, particularly intact packaging, but also significant quantities of exposed propellant charges and other components. The material was secured for further investigations.


A decision on reconstruction is pending.
Sheeting etc. was used to protect glass breakages. Repairs were carried out by specialist firms.
Glass breakages reported by nearby residents will be reimbursed.
Damage to buildings was assessed by construction engineers.


Ejected material was salvaged and collected.
The site was explored and assessed for soil contamination.
An evacuation plan was drawn up and adapted.

Local fire service:Support from the plant’s fire service with securing the site.
Police:Protection against unauthorised access.Inspection and re-opening of the areas for investigators.Inspection and re-opening of public areas.","
Company staff immediately checked the functioning and condition of electrical equipment in all storage buildings.
No defects were identified.


All storage buildings had their electrical equipment checked by an expert in electrical engineering, lightning protection and building code law. No defects were identified.


After an initial tour of the accident site to assess the buildings, all other storage buildings are now undergoing structural surveys. An initial on-site response verified the structures and, in particular, function of the decompression areas. The report is pending.


Technical possibilities are being examined for enabling similar incidents to be detected in advance. As conventional fire detection technology cannot be used due to the material properties and dynamics of the process, permanent monitoring of the internal chamber is being tested. The use of thermography or thermal imaging cameras has had to be abandoned in the meantime. Plans for remote optical and electronic monitoring are currently being developed.


Analytical checks on the samples recovered after the incident and corresponding comparative samples revealed no signs of instability or other anomalies. However, the storage period is seen as an influencing factor. Plans for the analytical/chemical monitoring of stock are therefore being drawn up as a potential means of addressing the root cause. In addition, computerised processes have been introduced to facilitate stock control and disposal.
In this context, extensive re-evaluations have already been carried out and large quantities of stock transferred for disposal.


The key factor in the scenario considered here is the combining of nitrocellulose, a material capable of spontaneous combustion, with gunpowder, a thermal material in which a quasi-detonative reaction can be induced. In future, material capable of spontaneous combustion (e.g. nitrocellulose), particularly if it is not used in construction, will be separated from material in which thermal excitation can cause a very rapid deflagration or even a detonative reaction within the meaning of storage category 1.1 (mass detonation). In the case of materials used in construction, a decision should be taken on a case-by-case basis according to the revised storage category and the item’s properties. Appropriate assessments and relocation on site have already been carried out.

On-site:

Primarily, the impact can be limited by adapting storage quantities to the local conditions. These are based on the legal requirements for protection and safety distances and will be complied with. There will be a periodic review as part of the updating of safety analysis and safety reporting in accordance with the Störfallverordnung, the mechanism under German law for regulating incidents.
Glass breakages on site premises will be further reduced by applying protective film to panes, preventing possible injuries to staff.
The construction of additional earth banks or protective walls was examined but does not seem appropriate in the current situation.

Off-site:

When the deflagration occurred in the storage building, smaller, relatively lightweight projection hazards (cardboard, sheeting, etc.) were thrown over the fence up to around 20&nbsp;m into the adjacent forest area. The trees between the warehouse and the fence had been thinned out due to parasite infestation. New planting took place.
In order to be able to further exclude risks to third parties, negotiations began on the purchase of the adjacent forest area to the south. A land-swap agreement is now in place. Formal implementation is pending. The area will be enclosed and the forest path running through it moved.

Pollution of the atmosphere by combustion gases and smoke.","Sirens, extinguishing and cooling measures by the on-site fire service and the professional fire brigade, measurement of harmful substances outside the refinery by the professional fire brigade (findings negative).","Lessons learned:

It is necessary to identify risks in order to introduce appropriate and robust mitigation measures, e.g. design, procedures, etc.
Dangers caused by the release of substances are not necessarily limited to the primary medium in which they are contained.
Opening the system with only a single block in the process is a risk, which requires particular consideration and for which measures appropriate to the operating permit must be introduced.
A high level of risk-awareness — including for routine work and the associated danger of risk normalisation — is required.
For hazardous activities, the worst-case scenario must be borne in mind.
Details recorded in shift logs can also assist with early identification of risks.
Tightening of a shut-off valve when the system is open can cause a sudden increase in the size of a leak.
Following training, checks are required to encourage the use of training content in the field.

Measures:

Risk awareness programme focusing on single block systems, ‘worst-case’ thinking, on-site inspection of hazardous activities, raising awareness of risk normalisation and communicating and discussing lessons learned from this incident.
Improvements in organisation and procedures: specification of more intensive risk analysis criteria as part of the operating authorisation procedure, improved communication during shift changeover, following up on training and revising the procedures concerned.

Technology: improved pipe routing and installation of a double block on these pumps, assessment of further technological measures and development of criteria for a subsequent review of technologically similar systems."
823,428,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Domino explosions and fire initiated by an ethylene leakage from a pipeline and explosion of the resulting cloud,1991-03-30 10:25:00,1991-03-30 16:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
A person of the ""Movement Service"" detected on the ""transethylene"" pipeline (10"" diameter, operating at a pressure of 45 bar) an ethylene leakage inside the refinery. Immediately, he alerted the personnel in the proximity of the leakage to abandon the site and called in the company fire brigade, that intervened immediately after. Not withstanding the alert, a vehicle of an external company passed through the gas cloud, and its motor stopped due to the high concentration of ethylene in air. The driver, trying to put again in operation his vehicle, created a spark which ignited the flammable gas cloud resulting in an explosion that caused the rupture of the ""transethylene"" pipeline and its deplacement. This originated a jet-fire, fed by the ethylene escaping through the ruptured pipeline, directed towards a warehouse containing tens of barrels of liquid hydrocarbons (ethyl acetate and dimethylcycloctadiene) and sacks of thermoplastic caoutchouc (rubber). A fire started in the warehouse. The shock wave produced by the explosion caused also the displacement of a second ethylene pipeline (diameter 6"", operating at a pressure of 90 bar) located under the 10"" pipe on the piperack. The displacement caused its fall and rupture, resulting in a second unconfined vapour cloud explosion. The company fire brigade was assisted by the fire brigades of nearby companies and the local fire brigade in extinguishing the fire.  4 fire fighting vehicles were damaged by the explosion of the gas cloud but, after about 2 hours, 2 of them were already operating. 2.5 hours later a third one was operating too. The plants administration offices (120m away from the fire) and the laboratory were evacuated. The operations with road tankers (carried out about 200m away) were stopped. The cooling of the tanks nearby the warehouse (about 50m away) was activated. At 15:00 it was decided to use foam in fire fighting operations and at about 16:00 the fire was extinguished (even if caoutchouc was continuing to smoke). 4 people were burned by the fire: one, seriously injured, was hospitalized using a helicopter; the others three (slightly injured) received first aids in the surgery of the site.

824,1035,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Discharge of environmentally hazardous substance into river from industrial park,2012-03-06 19:43:00,2012-03-07 00:00:00,"During the night of 6-7 March 2012, a fire in an industrial park, which broke out on the roof of a nitrile-amine plant, led to contamination of the river Alz by the company operating the site. Course of events at nitrile-amine plant:
A connecting pipe between the filtration unit and fume scrubber, which is intended to relieve the pressure in an empty filtration unit, caused a liquid reaction mixture to enter the fume scrubber. The majority of the reaction mixture which entered the scrubber flowed into the waste water sewer via the overflow in the scrubber and could be contained by the grease trap of the nitrile-amine plant (approximately 4 700 kg). Approximately 1 000 kg* of the reaction mixture went through a vent stack to the roof of the nitrile-amine plant where it caught fire (most likely spontaneous ignition due to copper (Cu) catalyst it contained). During the subsequent firefighting operation, much of the water used to extinguish the fire entered the cooling water and rainwater sewers via the roof drainage. This water was channelled along the sewer into a retention basin of the central water reservoir. Approximately 8 kg of the reaction mixture was discharged into the Alz before the valve to the retention basin was completely closed. After the firefighting operation was complete, approximately 100 kg of additional reaction mixture which had contaminated the sewers was discharged over the course of 9 hours through the cooling water outlet into the Alz. Fish kill was caused along a 14 km stretch of the Alz. Three members of the fire brigade were hurt during the firefighting operation or suffered burns during the subsequent clean-up operation and received outpatient treatment.
The member of staff from the nitrile-amine plant who discovered the fire was taken to hospital for precautionary reasons and placed under observation overnight. *The 1 000 kg (approx.) of product/copper catalyst mixture was discharged as follows:
- Approximately 200 kg was contained in the retention basin,
- Approximately 108 kg was discharged into water which entered the Alz,
- The remainder (approximately 692 kg) either combusted or was also discharged into the Alz.","System error / construction
At 18:53 on 6 March 2012 a ‘cloudy run’ was started in sector X, i.e. raw amine is pumped around in a circuit from the infeed through the filter until the product is clear and the next production stage (‘clear run’) can begin. At 19:19 a ball valve between the filter and the central scrubber opens. This ball valve is only needed for the ‘cake discharge’ function and may not be opened in normal operation. The ‘cake discharge’ function is only performed two to three times a year to clean the filter. The production stages in the nitrile-amine plant are controlled automatically in the control room via a process control system (PCS) in ‘step sequences’. Since the ball valve is designed as a closing valve, its basic or safety position is ‘OPEN’ (zero position). At the end of the step sequence ‘cake discharge’ the ball valve is closed again. This position ‘CLOSED’ is maintained by the PCS until the valve is activated again.
In September 2011 the PCS was converted to a new program which became operational in October 2011. Between the start-up of the new PCS and the incident on 6 March 2012 the ‘cake discharge’ step sequence was not activated. As a result of the conversion of the PCS the background information for the ball valve (‘CLOSED’) was lost. The result was that, in automatic mode, the ball valve switched to its basic position ‘OPEN’. When the step sequence ‘cloudy run’ is started the PCS checks, among other things, whether the ball valve is closed. Therefore, in order to close the ball valve, when the new PCS started up the operating mode was switched from ‘Automatic’ to ‘Manual’. At the above-mentioned time the operating mode overview which the operator can call up indicated that the ball valve status was ‘NOMINAL = A (AUTOMATIC), ACTUAL = M (MANUAL)’. Instead of a green button as in automatic mode, the operating mode overview showed a red button with the message ‘OK’.
Although the step sequence ‘cloudy run’ had been running without problem since 18:53, the operator switched the ball valve to Automatic and thus opened it. There was no safety check or locking of the ball valve in normal production operation.
After the ball valve opened the control room received various messages about rising pH levels and increasing pressure and temperature.
When the ball valve opened the pressure in the filter fell spontaneously to approx. 1.5 bar. At this pressure level the pressure at the filter in the waste gas scrubber also fell. The substance mixture entered the scrubber infeed (volume 2.5 m³) and filled it.
The scrubber infeed is open to the atmosphere, i.e. not under pressure. As a result of the pressure in the filter the scrubber infeed and the attached vent stack were completely filled in the period 19:19 to 19:38. At 19:38 product overflowed from the stack (23.5 m high) onto the roof of the building and then at 19:43 the product mixture ignited. It must be assumed that the substance mixture discharged through the stack (approx. 1 000 kg, part of which burned off) also ran off the tin roof of the plant to the building annexed (gutter, downpipe) and onto the lower-lying flat roof, as the mixture of firefighting water and substances subsequently did during the plant fire service deployment. From there it ran through the rainwater drain pipe into the cooling water and rainwater sewer (InfraServ Gendorf sector).
The scrubber infeed has a free overflow into the grease trap. Some of the approx. 4.7 t of the substance mixture ran out of the scrubber infeed through the plant waste water system to the grease trap and was contained there. The grease trap was sealed off at 20:02, so that from that time onwards no more plant waste water entered the central waste water cleaning installation. According to the operating instructions dated 4 November 2011, if product enters the manufacturing waste water sewer the grease trap must be closed immediately. Therefore the substance mixture had already been discharged through this drain before the fluid level in the scrubber had risen so far that the substance mixture could escape through the stack. Even during discharge through the stack, substance mixture continued to flow in the direction of the grease trap along the path described.
The substance mixture and the contaminated firefighting water entered the Alz via the cooling water and rainwater sewer. This led to major fish kill and damage to other life in the lower Alz along a stretch of almost 15 kilometres.",Material damage to plant and building. Fish kill along 14 km stretch,"Once the environmental impact had become apparent (fish kill in the Alz), all sewer systems in the central water reservoir were immediately diverted. - Plant fire service alerted (7.43 p.m.)
- Presence of all colleagues checked
- Plant emergency shut-down procedure activated (7.44 p.m.)
- Containment of water used to extinguish fire in central water reservoir from 7.56 p.m.
- Containment of contaminated cooling water from 9.21 a.m. on Wednesday 7 March 2012 Clean-up and repair work Environmental damage: measures agreed in consultation with authorities and fisheries experts.","The points listed below represent the recommendations made in accordance with § 19(3), subparagraph 3, StörfallV (Hazardous Incident Regulation). For clarity, the individual measures are briefly outlined as follows. 1. Segregation of the cooling water and rainwater sewer from roof areas which can be polluted by hazardous substances in the event of a malfunction.
The rainwater system of the roof areas of the building affected by the fire no longer drains into the cooling water and rainwater sewer but, by agreement with the water management office, is connected to the plant sewer system.
Similar measures for other areas of the industrial park will require a master plan approved by the authorities. 2. Monitoring of the TOC (total organic carbon) level in the cooling water and rainwater sewers.
For technical reasons the readings from TOC monitoring in the South section of the cooling water and rainwater sewer are displayed after a time lag of approx. five minutes. This time lag is now offset by having the lower valve located directly ahead of the discharge point into the Alz close at the same time as the upper valve when TOC monitoring gives the signal. Thus, given the flow speed of the water, there is sufficient time to contain any polluted water which has already passed the upper valve by closing the lower valve.
The readings from TOC monitoring in the East section of the cooling water and rainwater sewer are also displayed after a time lag of approx. five minutes for technical reasons. It is currently being examined whether additional TOC monitoring can be installed at a point upstream in the system. 3. All-clear for contaminated sewers given by the plant fire service only after analyses have been carried out.
To prevent any product residues from being washed into the Alz together with cooling water following firefighting operations, where sewers have been loaded with substances toxic to fish or generally hazardous to the environment, in future they will not be given the all-clear until analysis has shown that no products are present. 4. More specific operating instructions and training of staff in the wastewater treatment plant.
The technical and organisational measures taken will be set out in more precisely worded operating instructions for the staff in the wastewater treatment plant. The staff will receive training and instruction twice per year. At the most recent training session it was again pointed out what measures must be taken when certain limit values are reached and in what sequence the valves must be activated in hazardous situations. 5. Shortening the closing time of valves in the cooling water and rainwater sewer.
The stretch of sewer which is closed off by the upper valve has a diameter of 1.2 m.
At normal water levels only approx. 10 to 15 % of that diameter are needed. The basic position of the valve is now set such that only the diameter actually needed is open. This shortens the closing time of the valve. 6. Review of firefighting water retention system.
The plant’s local firefighting water retention system was checked in accordance with the applicable regulations.
The central water retention system is state-of-the-art. It was found to meet the requirements of the applicable regulations in full.
Nevertheless further investigations are currently being carried out to technically optimise the installation, in particular as regards substances which are insoluble and lighter than water. 7. Isolating cooling water from products hazardous to the environment.
In the plant all points at which substances with a fish toxicity of ? 0.1 mg/l are cooled by water are being converted to isolated (primary/secondary circuit) or circulation cooling. 8. Review of all safety equipment in the plant.
All plants in the industrial park will undergo a renewed check and assessment on the basis of the inventory of substances present. The existing safety measures will be reviewed on the basis of the results obtained. If necessary further measures will be laid down. 9. Re-examination of other measuring and monitoring methods.
It is being investigated whether cutting-edge metrology exists with which the sampling of flowing cooling water at varying water levels can be improved even further."
825,83,Near Miss,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire in the vacuum distillation unit of a refinery,2013-03-04 09:00:00,2013-03-04 10:31:00,"Damage to the pipe connecting the delivery side of the bottom pump to the delivery side of the feed pump caused vacuum distillate and then vacuum residue at a temperature of approximately 350&nbsp;°C to leak in the area of the top withdrawal pump and cooling/rinsing tank and then to catch fire.There were no injuries.The material damage amounts to around €2-3&nbsp;million. Amongst other things, the cooling/rinsing tank, pumps and numerous pipes, items of process measuring and control equipment and the steel structure were severely damaged by the fire and need to be replaced.
Timeline of the incident:- At around 8.55 a.m., three employees of a partner company left their place of work near the scene of the subsequent fire and met by a furnace.- The employees of the partner company looked again in the direction of the facility and noticed leaking product and, immediately afterwards, flames.- At the same time, members of site staff were working on the periodic replacement of the bottom withdrawal pump of a column. At 8.58 a.m., a reserve pump was started up. At 8.59 a.m., an alarm on the process control system signalled ’pressure low’ on the delivery side of the bottom withdrawal pump. Immediately afterwards, an alarm signalled a falling level in the column and a decrease in the quantity delivered to a ‘90-degree pipe’.- Site staff in the measuring station noticed flames in the area of the vacuum distillation unit on a surveillance camera and informed other colleagues on site.- The shift leader on site alerted the plant fire service at approximately 9.01 a.m. and informed colleagues in the plant by radio that a fire had been reported in the area of the top withdrawal pump. Shortly after, an emergency shutdown of the plant was implemented.- The plant fire service was dispatched and started extinguishing the fire; back-up was then requested from part-time firefighters.- At 10.17 a.m., the fire was under control and by 10.31 a.m. it had been extinguished.","The pipe connects the delivery sides of the feed pump and the bottom pump with the start-up pipe on the intake side of the top withdrawal pump.
The column is filled via the start-up pipe and the pipes are run dry. After the start-up procedure, the pipe remains closed on one side and filled with vacuum distillate (dead end). It is closed at the connection to the delivery side of the feed pump and is subjected to two-phase heating from below by means of steam tracing. The vacuum distillate in the pipe contains approximately 2 per cent by weight sulfur. The pipeline was opened on the delivery side of the bottom pump, where there are fluid temperatures of around 350&nbsp;°C.
The damage to the pipe is due to high-temperature sulfur corrosion. The presence of sulfur and temperatures above 260&nbsp;°C are necessary for this process.
The damaged area is located approximately 30&nbsp;m downstream of the operating path from the bottom pump to a heat exchanger. The following are to be considered very likely causes:
- H2S introduced by the effect of thermosiphoning.- Leaking gate valve on the cold side (feed pump) causing sulfurous product to enter at &gt;&nbsp;260&nbsp;°C.
When the reserve pump was started up, there was an increase in pressure, causing a weakened point to rupture.
Past pipe inspection programmes did not detect any signs of corrosion. The programmes were designed to detect normal signs of corrosion; a gas phase in the upper part of the pipe was not anticipated.
High-temperature sulfur corrosion, through the entry of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (thermosiphon effect) at an operating temperature of approximately 260&nbsp;°C.","Damage to pipelines, equipment and the steel structure.","Immediate extinguishing measures by the plant fire service, instant shutdown of the plant, notification of the competent authorities and the public.
Draining and reconstruction of parts of the plant to be recommissioned.
Collection of (solid) product for disposal.","- All staff notified of the incident and its causes.-&nbsp; Inspection - where sulfurous materials are kept at medium temperature under similar conditions, the testing programme must include pipes in the 12 o’clock position.- Check whether there are similar connecting pipes and ensure that they are opened to the side with the lower potential risk.
The following instructions are to be included in the operating regulations:- “After the 'bottom pump - top withdrawal pump' VD operating cycle has finished, close the connecting valves on the intake side of the top withdrawal pump and on the delivery side of the bottom pump in the system connecting the feed pump, bottom pump and top withdrawal pump’. The gate valve on the delivery side of the feed pump should remain open in order to prevent locking of the system connecting the feed pump, bottom pump and top withdrawal pump.”- Periodic temperature measurements are taken (under operating conditions) on the pipelines which are closed on one side, where the conditions are present for high-temperature sulfur corrosion.- Ignition and post-ignition temperatures of heavy products must be determined and added to the operating instructions."
826,427,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Accident in the vinyl chloride production plant of a petrochemical industry caused by maintenance,1990-12-13 11:50:00,1990-12-13 00:00:00,"ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:
The wind directed the gas cloud produced by the fire towards Tavaux.

ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
During a weekly test programme, at 11:30 two maintenance operators started to test the isolation valves and the space piston pump. At about 11:50 this spare pump was switched-on and, immediately after, a leakage from a piping located above the operators occurred. They quickly escaped towards the control room before the gas was ignited by the pyrolysis furnace. The Internal Emergency Plan was activated. The unit was shut-down and fire protection means were activated while the affected area was evacuated. The fire was not extinguished to avoid formation of an explosive gas cloud; at the same time the protection of structures exposed to intense heat radiation using cooling via fixed monitors and of the pyrolysis furnace by means of a fixed water curtain was necessary. Isolation valves around the unit on fire were closed to reduce the amount of flammable substances potentially involved. However, one of the isolation valves could not be completely closed (because the accident occurred during a test) and therefore the duration of the fire was prolonged. After 10 minutes other pipes were ruptured causing an escalation of the fire, which was finally extinguished after 13 hours (at about 00:45). Damages to the plant were confined to an area of 20-25m radius on a platform at an elevation of 6m. A nearby school was evacuated when a hydrogen chloride concentration of 10-15ppm was measured in the vicinity. Hydrogen chloride concentrations measured indicate that confinment should have been preferred versus the evacuation. Ambient air monitoring performed by the local mobile chemical emergency intervention unit could detect only traces of toxic gases. Used fire fighting water was collected for treatment at the waste-water treatment facilities of the plant. Water quality measurements in samples taken from the waste-water discharge channel and the river revealed no pollution.","CAUSES:
The piping rupture has been attributed to internal erosion caused by the abrasive action due to the solid particles (4-6 g/l coal particulate) contained in the circulating fluid. Besides, further studies confirmed that the installation of a diaphragm with an opening smaller than originally planned (in order to obtain a more accurate measure of the liquid flow) aggravated the erosion (the diameter reduction of the diaphragm from 192mm to 132mm caused an increase of the liquid speed of a factor of 2.1 and of the turbulence effects of a factor of 4.5). In effects, the piping, in a zone downstream 10-60cm the diaphragm, showed a higher erosion than in the other section and therefore, when the spare pump was switched-on, the liquid flow was sufficient to rupture the pipe.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 1 person was hospitalized by psychological shock due to the flash fire. Outside the establishment 1 person (a 14 years girl) was hospitalized and 10 pupils of a nearby school were examined by personnel of the hospital of Dole.MATERIAL LOSS:During the first phase of the fire (before to put in service the protection means), heat radiation damaged the majority of the devices made with not resistant materials (cables, measurement instruments, shields and cable channel) in a radius of 20-25 metres on a platform at an elevation of&nbsp; 6 meters.&nbsp; Within this zone there has been also the deformation of some structures and the rupture of 12 pipes. No data are available about the cost of the material damages.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The population has been advised to stay indoors. Traffic in the national high-way No 73 and other roads of minor importance around the site were interrupted. These precautionary measures were taken up to 16:15.&nbsp; SOLVAY personnel performed toxic gas measurements near the school C.E.S. in the city of Tavaux. Concentrations of about 10-15ppm of hydrogen chloride were measured and the school (50 pupils) was evacuated towards a school in Dole. The fire was extinguished by the plant fire brigade (58 people).Ecological harm - Remarks: Ambient air monitoring performed by the local mobile chemical emergency intervention unit could detect only traces of toxic gases.

The tank remained in use. After a few days, in the course of other routine activities significant denting was found on the tank roof of the fixed-roof tank. The storage tank is sealed.
Safety functions:The tank was immediately emptied as much as possible.","Root causes:Repairs were to be carried out as part of a planned one-day maintenance operation on a nozzle section used both to prevent overfilling and to vent the tank. As the repair work on the nozzle section could not be completed on the same day, the nozzle section on the tank was partially or fully sealed with a perforated sealing plate (rain protection). The tank, both filled as well as emptied, was in normal operation for several days with the temporarily perforated and weighted sealing plate over the nozzle section. The perforated sealing plate decreased the free ventilation cross section over the nozzle section’s opening; as a result, the tank was no longer adequately ventilated and pressure was reduced.

The extension of the repair work on the overfill security device was notified by a partner company. The procedure described in the instructions to notify this situation (e.g. entry in the shift log) and to determine actions was not followed.
Inappropriate (wrong) decision taken based on the ‘all openings must be sealed’ refinery principle.
Inadequate checks by the company (doubling of staff workload).
",Damaged tank.,"As a precaution, the tank was emptied and the area around the tank sealed off.
Damage repair plans are currently being drawn up.","Drafting of an instruction:Vent openings must not be covered; if a covering is required, this is permitted only after a prior risk assessment.
Raising staff awareness:Prioritisation of upcoming work with line managers at times of excessive workload.New risk assessment in case of changes to planned workflows.
The follow-up to the incident revealed various aspects that can offer lessons for avoiding similar incidents.In the case of atmospheric tanks (flat floor tanks), the vents provided must not be covered or otherwise sealed. Both product intake and removal and temperature variations can create sufficient pressure differentials to jeopardise tank integrity in the absence of ventilation.Changes in workflows, particularly revised implementation or extended duration, mean that particular attention should be paid to communication between contractors and the responsible plant management. Plant management should be aware of the state of the plant and ensure that it is safe.If workloads are heavy, security-related tasks must be performed. This calls for prioritisation to take place with line managers. Achieving this requirement calls for a culture that allows staff to address such situations and managers who possess the awareness to promptly identify the threat of overload.The human factor in safety must not be overlooked."

A contractor discovered the leak, and the alarm was activated manually. The plant was evacuated. The area was ""foamed"" and watercurtains activated in order to avoid that&nbsp; flammable gas was drifting towards potential ignition sources (ovens). Main parts of the refinery process units were shut down. The leakage was stopped 23:30. Leakage rate is estimated to be approximately 10 liters pr minute. In total 4400 liters was released and collected by an open drainage system. No environmental consequences.","The direct cause was corrosion under insulation in a 4” pipe between av naphta pump and a cooler. The indirect cause was that this pipe had fallen out of the inspection system SAP in 2008, and therefore had not been inspected since.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;","Regarding the operation of the plant the consequences were small because they were able to operate the plant without this pipeline. There were no environmental consequences beacuse the leakage was collected in a closed open drainage system. The plant started normal operation again shortly after the disconnection of the corroded part of the system. The naphta was close to the boiling point when it was released, and therefore the operators may have been exposed to benzen. This is not yet clarified.Potentially the leakage could have been ignited by the furnaces and started a fire in the pipestill area. Due to the lack of fire- and gas detection systems in this part of the plant, a fire could have escalated. A fire also could have resulted in an increase of the leakage rate from the corroded pipe, causing even further escalation.&nbsp;","After the leakage was identified by the operator the following actions were taken: Alarming of the control room, check of leakage point, activation of the gas alarm and of the emergency preparedness organisasion (15 minutes after the leakage was identified), evacuation of non-essential personnel, foaming of the leakage point and surrounding areas, activation of technical support, activation of permanent and mobile fire extinguishing equipment, installation of water curtains in order to prevent gas reaching hot surfaces like furnaces, installation of mobile hydrocarbon detectors between the point of leakage and the potential ignition source. From activation of the alarm, it took 40 minutes before all non-essential personnel was accounted for. This happened because the normal registration system for evacuated personnel was located in a room that was closed due to the ongoing covid-19 situation. Foaming and other activities were continued until the leakage was stopped and the situation was under control.","Plant/Equipment: Corrosion of piping under insulation due to lack of inspection
Organisational/ system related:&nbsp;
- The system did not assertain that that all essential equipment/ piping was included in the inspection and maintenance programme.
- The risk assessment did not evaluate the need for fire- and gas detection in the pipestill area. Had there not been personnel present, the leakage might not be identified in time to prevent an ignition.
Human: The safety of involved operations- and maintenance personnel was nut sufficient during this situation. In the early phase of the situation 3 operators were close to the point of leakage in order to identify the leakage point. They did not carry with them the neccessary HC-gasdetector nor protection against benzen-exposure. This was not according to internal procedures.&nbsp;"

The ""Robert Maersk"" tank ship (transporting 22,000 tonnes of gasoline), coming from REPSOL PETROLEO Refinery in La Coruna, during 'parking' manoeuvre crashed into the jetty for the loading/unloading activities. The crash happened near the palisade close to the platform and caused the rupture of the naphtha pipeline (the first in position) and surely of some others, among those of the crude oil, causing the release of flammable liquid onto the sea. The flammable liquid (naphta and crude oil) released was then ignited resulting in a huge fire that caused the collapse of 275 m of the protection. When the impact occurred, ""Capitan Putilin"" ship was discharging naphtha and ""Gaz Coral"" ship was loading butadiene but both were able to leave the anchorage by means of their engines.","CAUSES:
The cause of the crash of the ""Robert Maersk"" tank ship with the jetty was a human error during the parking manoeuvre. The flammable liquid (naphta and crude oil) released onto the sea was then ignited by a spark between the pipelines due to the friction created by the impact or by a short-circuit in the electrical system (the sub-station sited on the platform No 35 fell down in the water).","MATERIAL LOSS:The accident caused large material damage, among which the collapse of 275 metres of the harbour protection and the electrical substation of platform No 35 that fell into the water.

Their job was to wash, absolutize the equipment in accordance with the Cleaning Instruction, before the start of amino-camphor HCl production.There were already technical failures before the absolutization step, which were repaired.In early hours of 3rd December after repairing the failures washing toluene was filled from autoclave R-230 via pump SZ-243 into the inertized, self-discharging centrifugal machine FI-231.During the dismounting of pneumatic pipeline air entered into the centrifugal machine.The closed - originally inert - system became opened for a short period and this changed the properties of inert state inside the drum of centrifugal machine which rotated with unchanged speed. As the technician assembled the dismounted pipeline the air-space with changed concentration was closed in the centrifugal machine.The inertization system was launched while the system became open, i. e. nitrogen entered into the centrifugal machine, until the centrifugal machine did not reached the closed status and the pressure reached the value of 8-14 mbar.After this the centrifugal machine was operated without load for about 1 hour, while the nitrogen feed which assures the overpressure activated presumably several times.During this step at 5:12 explosion happened inside of the centrifugal machine, and thereafter fire started around the centrifugal machine.There is no evidence for source of ignition, but the ignition of explosive gas mixture was probably caused by electrostatic discharge.","Oxygen entered into the - originally inertized - centrifugal machine, because of technological failure.Based on the fire-analyses it can be stated that the accident occurred because of technical failure.

Estimated at 1 Million Euros.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment,"Emergency measures - Remarks: The fire-alarm center got alarmed as the accident happened, after this, the person present in the center alarmed the company fire brigade, the on-site action coordinating person (dispatcher), the security service and the electrical duty-office. In 3-4 minutes the squad-leader informed the local fire-station and also the county emergency directorate. The competent managers of the company were ordered in. The plant firemen rescued the casualty (5:17), localized the fire, and then extinguished. The local firemen arrived at site (5:30) helped in post-accident activity. The seriously injured worker was brought to central medical ambulance and from there to county hospital. Meanwhile the informed leaders of authorities arrived. The fire-fighting was finished by 6:20. The reconstruction of the installation was finished by 22. 09. 2003.Seveso II duties - remarks: By the time of accident the safety analysis of the plant was not prepared. The amended government decree of 2/2001 stated 1st April 2003 as deadline for sending in the safety analyses, thus the plant could fulfill the SEVESO II obligations and undertakings only in part.Discussion about the response:At 5:15 on 3rd December 2002 fire-alarm came from the plant, which was confirmed also by phone. The firemen went to site immediately with all of the fire-extinguishing equipments. 4 person and the safety officer on duty went to the site.Fire was seen in room for weighing dangerous material.Exploring the sit they observed one person in fire. The reinforced glass wall beside the door has been broken by the firemen. The person in fire stepped out.The officer on duty and the workers helped the casualty to get into the car and in transport. At 5:20 the staff was ordered to assemble one fire-extinguisher powder-gusher and extinguish the fire of unknown material, which went out by using the powder-gusher. Meanwhile the firemen noticed that there is fire around the toluene-tank.They experienced that the equipment were in fire, heavy, black smoke coming through the door. The staff was ordered to replace the powder-gusher. While the replace of powder-gusher was not ready they started to extinguish the fire with 50 kg dry chemical extinguisher placed near to the room. The fire went out, but we saw leak on top of the equipment and on two places behind o fit, which reinflamed in short time. By that time the replacement of powder-gusher was done and we shot the powder. After this the fire went out, and then 2-3 times reinflamed and liquid material was leaking further to the top of the equipment and behind the equipment. Because of this in about one minute after extinguishing the fire there was a larger reinflame of fire, but it was also extinguished with powder-gusher, but because of these inflammations the electrical lines under the ceiling on cable-ladder were in flame and the fire spread in direction of control room. By this time I ordered to replace the powder-gusher to the other entrance and we tried to get a reinflaming fire under. By this time arrived the department leader. After consulting with him beside applying the powder-gusher, they ordered to assemble a water-gusher, because they got by this time the putting out declaration of electrical office on duty. After this the electrical cable and minor reinflames were extinguished by water-gusher. The gusher had to be replaced to direction of control room, because the fire spread on cable to that direction. Meanwhile the fire-protection leader arrived, who ordered a worker and/or a fireman to install a generator-lighting to the entrance near to control room. Further this door was used for extinguishing the cable fire. Two firemen started to explore the upper floor, with help of firemen, who arrived by that time. Because of high temperature and heavy smoke the orientation was not easy, but they did not experienced fire in the upper floor, only in the right lower part of the computer room. For extinguishing of this fire a new gusher was assembled, in which the firemen helped. The fire went out in minutes, later the focus went to cooling the equipment, and/or in upper floor, furthermore in ground floor the drying external door and the transit door in front of the fire were opened.Later we got request to cool the centrifugal machine and the equipment above, which was requested by the division leader.","There was no action in operational field. The technology has been modified, instead of centrifugal machine, filter-dryer has been put into operation.
Measures to prevent recurrence:&nbsp; Following measures were ordered in the plant in connection with the incident on 3rd December 2002. In every case, the deadlines and responsible persons were determined.1. Pneumatic pipelines:- By installing new pneumatic systems the standard color marking for pipelines has to be applied.- In case of existing systems - where via the pneumatic pipelines both compressed air and nitrogen are used - the pipelines for nitrogen has to be changed for yellow color.2. The nitrogen flushing of the space between liquid phase outlet and liquid seal - which is ""dead space"" in regard of inertization - has to be solved.3. The exchange of&nbsp;flexible pipes to rigid ones - ensuring the gas-tight function between the centrifugal machines and centrifugal wagon, applying solid material sealing and the coupling assuring the gas-tight state by mechanical way has to be considered. If it is not possible, then supply of inflatable tubes shall be provided by nitrogen. 4. The exchange of filtering centrifugal machine FI-231 and applying other type of filtering equipment."

Intensive lab research was carried out and Cillworth (UK) and other Pharmaceutical Industries were consulted.Definitive conclusion (retained hypothesis): Impurities of an alkali metal in one of the raw materials were much higher then in former batches (250 batches were already performed) and higher then foreseen. The total amount of the impurities was still below the maximum specified. There was no specification for this specific impurity. This impurity had a catalyzing effect on the HN3-producing reaction and not on the HN3-consuming reaction. This led to higher then normal production of HN3 which led to higher concentrations. Most probably the explosion occurred inside glass connections between the reflux cooling and gas purification. There liquid HN3 had accumulated to such a degree that it became highly unstable.,The outside wall was blown away as foreseen as a measure by explosion. The interior of the reactor cell was heavily burned. All glass lining was blown away.Immediately after the explosion a fire occurred which set the thermal oil on fire. This was the largest fire burden and damaged severely the outside of the building.There were no victims due to the low presence of operators (almost all vital parameters have recording instruments outside the reactor cell) and blast resistant wall between the reactor cell and the rest of the building.,Internal emergency plan was immediately launched.​Internal and external fire brigade came into action.,Lessons learned:Positive:  The damage inside the building was limited to a single reaction cell and the housing of the thermal oil and the outside due to - the arrangement of two reactor in reactor cells isolated by explosion resistant walls- the outside wall was built as an explosion panel so the pressure was released to the outside (high enough above ground level)There were no victims also due to a limited presence possible by bringing all continuous monitoring to the outside of the explosion resistant walls.- Negative: The cause was not detected in the risk analyses. Only the total fraction of all impurities was limitedThe reaction analysis and possible catalysis by impurities was not investigated at the highest concentration as tolerated by the specification.

848,1302,Major Accident,"LPG production, bottling and bulk distribution",Release of LPG following the opening of valves in a spherical tank,2021-07-23 12:30:00,2021-07-23 13:20:00,"The safety valves in a spherical butane tank opened, releasing LPG gas and causing a very loud noise.","The safety valves opened because of excess pressure caused by propane entering the butane tank. According to the operator, the pump attendant in charge of transfers that day left a pump intake valve open when transferring propane, thus allowing contact between the butane tank and the spherical tank containing propane. The following came to light after the event:

the unloading procedure did not specify that the opening/closure of the selector valves had to be checked;
there was no interlock on the shut-off devices on the selector valves for the butane line;
there were no visual or acoustic high-pressure alarms at the LPG pumping station;&nbsp;
there was no high-pressure safety interlock;
the preliminary risk analysis ruled out with no explanation the scenario of propane entering the butane tank.
",3 t of commercial butane was released into the atmosphere.,"The staff present started up the fire pump. At 12:40 p.m., the gas concentration in the containment bund was 33% LEL. The water spray was targeted at the butane and propane tanks. A pump attendant shut off an open valve situated at the inlet of a compressor allowing suction from the butane tank to be activated. At 12:50 p.m. the safety valves closed. At 1:00 p.m., the LPG pumps were started up again in closed circuit in order to draw up the liquid butane and release it into the vapour space so as to reduce the temperature and pressure. At 1:15 p.m., a butane tank truck was connected to one of the unloading stations. The loading arm was connected to the vapour space and the butane from the truck was emptied into the tank. This caused the pressure to quickly fall to 4.6 bar. The gas was fed into another spherical tank. At 1:20 p.m., water stopped being sprayed and normal activity resumed. At 4:20 p.m., pressure in the butane tank was 2.3 bar. Patrols to monitor the pressure in the butane tank were organised for the weekend.","As a result of the accident, the operator took the following actions:

all possible points where the butane line and propane line could come into contact with each other were identified;
technical solutions were put in place to prevent the lines coming into contact due to human error;
a high-pressure alarm system was installed;
the utility of putting in place a high-pressure safety system was examined;
the preliminary risk analysis was supplemented and the hazard assessment was adapted;
procedures and the internal emergency plan were updated so as to describe the actions to be taken in scenarios of this type;
a procedure for unloading operations was created.

850,110,Major Accident,"Power generation, supply and distribution ",Fire in a fertiliser warehouse of a biogas plant,2016-07-31 18:00:00,2016-08-01 14:30:00,"A fire broke out in a fertiliser warehouse of a biogas plant at approximately 18.00 on 31 July 2016. The warehouse includes a storage room for dried digestate and a digestate drying process, including air scrubbing and a sulphuric acid tank required for this process. The fire in the digestate drying process resulted in the release of biogas as a result of the emergency flare being shut down so that the fire could be extinguished. In addition, the fire in the drying hall destroyed the acid tank and sulphuric acid leaked out.
Safety measure:31 July 2016, approx. 18:30: Once the plant manager arrived, the gas pipes leading to the combined heat and power plant (CHP) plant were closed and the CHP plant was shut down.
31 July 2016, approx. 18:45: The electricity was switched off to protect the firefighters, thereby consciously turning off the emergency flare. Using water, etc. made it imperative that the site be completely free of electrical tension. This also meant that an existing portable back-up power generator could not be connected either, for safety reasons.
(As a result, the biogas could not be used for energy purposes or burned via the gas flare. Once the gas storage tank’s maximum gas storage volume was reached, the excess quantities of biogas had to be released into the atmosphere via the tank’s excess pressure release system.)
1 August 2016, approx. 12:00: In order to speed up cooling and prevent the formation of ember nests, the dried digestate was recovered from the hall.
1 August 2016, approx. 14:30: Fire site given the all-clear. The electricity connection was then directly re-established and the flare re-engaged.
In order to ensure the operation of the flare, an emergency power generator was provided. The fire site remained closed off until 2 August 2016 for investigations by the Criminal Police.","Due to what was presumed to be spontaneous combustion of digestate, the release of biogas in the fire area had to be prevented to safeguard the plant.Accordingly, the entire biogas supply was shut off. This could only be achieved by closing the main pipe at the fermenter, so that no biogas could reach the gas flare. As a result, the biogas was not flared but released into the atmosphere via the excess pressure release system.
Ambient release of biogas resulting from the loss of electrical power due to a fire in a neighbouring hall.","The fire caused material damage to the fertiliser warehouse and digestate drying [equipment].
Two firefighters were sent to hospital as a precaution. After examinations of their respiratory tracts, they were released in good health after a few hours.","- During the events, protective measures by the operator were not possible (see safety measures).- Retrieval of dried digestate from the fertiliser storage hall to prevent further formation of ember nests.- Restoration of the power supply after the all-clear was given at the fire site. As a result, the flare was brought back into operation.- Ensuring that flare operation is guaranteed by providing an emergency power generator.Measurement by the fire brigade of the sulphur [dioxide] content of the air downwind.","Measures to reduce the risk of fire in the vicinity of the biogas plant:- Modernisation of drying equipment. In future, a so-called Mississippi dryer will be used instead of a belt dryer. Instead of completely drying part of the digestate to a dry matter content of 98%, the digestate is only concentrated and then pumped back to the repository. In future, therefore, there will be no need to store dried digestate. Moreover, unlike the belt dryer technology, there are as yet no known cases of fire caused by a Mississippi dryer.- The storage of sulphuric acid in large quantities is also no longer necessary. Although H2SO4 is still needed, it is no longer stored in advance but delivered in IBC containers as required.- A meeting was organised. The operator, the competent administrative authority, the local mayor and the officers of the nearby voluntary fire brigades took part. It was possible to put together a number of recommendations on how the operator could optimise the conditions for fire extinguishing operations. In particular, the operator has agreed to extend the local area’s fire-fighting pond and thus improve the supply situation of the entire local area.On 6 October 2016 an external institute was commissioned to update the existing fire protection plan. The above-mentioned requirements are included in the planning application and will be implemented in the reconstruction.
Measures to prevent biogas emission:- An emergency generator on the plant site continues to provide additional safety of electricity supply to the plant and to the gas flare.- The use of a gas camera confirmed the integrity of the gas storage membrane.- As part of the process of increasing flexibility, the operator plans to build another external gas storage tank on the site. Therefore, should a similar case arise, the biogas would be diverted to the external gas storage tank instead of being incinerated by the gas flare or released through pressure relief system."
851,1264,Major Accident,Other activity (not otherwise specified int the list),Fire in a cooling unit,2020-12-27 21:10:00,2020-12-27 21:10:00,"According to the findings made, the fire was caused by an error in the operation of a control oil filter for a steam turbine drive of an ammonia compressor.
The control oil filter consists of two sides which can be operated alternately. When changing the filter cartridge, the side of the filter in question is deactivated by means of a shift lever. In the belief that the lever was in the correct position, the side of the filter through which the oil flowed was accidentally opened for a maintenance procedure (sealing a leak in the filter housing).The turbine oil which immediately escaped in a wide stream soon ignited on the hot surface of the steam turbine, which was at a temperature of approximately 380&nbsp;°C. The resulting oil fire spread to the main cable routes running near the steam turbine.
Safety measures:Emergency stop activated and on-site fire brigade alerted via fire detection system; professional fire brigade alerted via security centre. (SIZE).",The fire was triggered by an error in the operation of a control oil filter for the steam turbine drive of the ammonia compressor in the cooling unit.A technical error has been ruled out.,"Damage to the plant due to fire damage. Cost: EUR&nbsp;13,000,000.","On-site:Firefighting by on-site fire brigade supported by professional fire brigade. The area around the damage site was immediately cordoned off by the emergency response team; the firefighting water produced was retained.
Off-site:Air samples were taken and analysed by an air pollution measuring vehicle. The public was informed via the emergency information and news app (NINA).
Further cleaning and clearing measures are being taken in the operating area. Parts of the plant are in need of repair. No further action is needed outside the operating area.

A chemical assessment of building and fire damage was immediately undertaken, including sample-taking and analysis and the defining of health and safety measures.
Cleaning by a specialist firm and supervision of cleaning by experts.
","Fires in turbine oil systems, whether in steam or in gas turbine plants, frequently occur and often result in high levels of material damage. The combination of turbine oil, which is essential for the lubrication of the turbine bearings, and very hot surfaces in the immediate vicinity may result in a fire in the event of an – ultimately sometimes unavoidable – leak.The likelihood of a turbine oil fire such as this can be reduced by a combination of the following precautions and measures:The particular and rare combination of an ammonia-cooling plant with a steam turbine drive gives rise to fire hazards which are not covered by TRAS&nbsp;110 (Technische Regeln für Anlagensicherheit – technical rules for plant safety). Additional fire protection requirements therefore have to be met.
In the hazard analysis for ‘external leakage’, the possibility of the leaked turbine oil igniting on contact with the hot surfaces of the steam turbine must be considered and the following countermeasures laid down:

Turbine oil leakage monitoring systemsThese consist, for example, of a continuous check of the level of oil in the oil container and monitoring of any rapid reduction of the level.In addition, collection trays in the area of the oil pumps and turbines, for example, might be fitted with leak monitoring (level detection switches).
Fire protection switchesFire protection switches should be installed in the central control room, in the area of the steam turbine and along the escape routes. When activated, these trigger the rapid shutdown of the turbine and switch off all auxiliary oil pumps once the turbine has stopped operating.
Constructive fire prevention measuresThe turbine oil systems – in particular the main oil filter and the control oil filter which caused this incident – must, as far as possible, be located separately from the steam turbine.Steam pipes must be carefully insulated and cladded.It should be checked whether the building’s retention of substances hazardous to water can be designed in such a way that if there is burning turbine oil, it does not result in under-burning of the steam turbine or plant components which carry ammonia.
Fine spray extinguishing systemAccording to the literature [HDI&nbsp;2016], stationary spray extinguishing systems have proved successful in the case of turbine oil fires in steam turbines. In such systems, the turbine, the oil container and the other oil-carrying parts are provided with a large number of fine spray nozzles which spray water when triggered by an automatic fire detection system (UV detection, heat and smoke detection and in some cases multi-criteria detectors).The advantages of these spray extinguishing systems are the comparatively small quantities of firefighting water and the uniform distribution over the plant to be protected.

For that reason and/or because of developing of toxic products of combustion 17 residents were evacuated.For fire-fighting there were used 33000 litre of extinguisher-foaming material, 5000 kg of extinguisher powder and 3.5 million litre of water. The large volume fire-extinguishing water moved via the channelling toward the Danube. It was managed to close at water treatment station on time, thanks to quick action the access of extinguishing water into the living water was prevented, the river was not polluted.Chronology of the event:A former, drug-addict employee of the company crawled into the warehouse on rest-day, and after inhalation of thinner vapours became stuporous, lighted a cigarette. After this fire started, which in short time spread to the whole warehouse.The person captured in the warehouse ran to the grid and shouted for help. The porter being in further distance ran to the site to check what happened. As he saw the warehouse in fire and the person within shaking the grid, ran for the key. After coming back he tried to unlock the door, but because of high heat-load he could not approach the building.The cans, drums were exploding continuously, endangering the near-by residential houses and the firemen arrived for extinguishing the fire. Because of the huge heat-load 36 fire-engine and 143 firemen were fighting against the fire in turns, for more than 9 hours. For fire-fighting there were used 33000 litres of extinguisher-foaming material, 5000 kg of extinguisher powder and 3.5 million litre of water. The large volume fire-extinguishing water moved via the channelling toward the Danube. It was managed to close at water treatment station on time, thanks to quick action the access of extinguishing water into the living water was prevented, the river was not polluted. One person - the causer of fire - died in fire, 10 firemen suffered injuries.The fire started between 08.40-08.50 on Saturday 26th June 1988 in the paint-store of warehouse. The detection of fire was enabled by smoke, flames and silent popping voice coming from the building (08.53). The fire-station was informed by reception via direct fire-alarm telephone. The plant staff (3 porters, 1 electrician) did not tried to extinguish the fire. The alarm-notices from the residential people arrived from 08.54, in which huge smoke and five floor high flame was mentioned.At 08.58 - based on exploration - the whole warehouse was in fire, the fire endangered the open-air storage place near to the warehouse. Despite of quick action the spread of fire to cans could not be prevented, the plastic cans placed on pallets melted and the linseed oil stored in them fired floated as lava, causing direct danger of life of gusher-leaders and danger to fire-engines. The liquid in fire on the yard endangered two near-by buildings (paint-stores), the spread of fire to these buildings could have caused incalculable consequences. Because of quick spread of fire the fire-fighting leader increased the alarm-level at 09.06. At 09.08 the attempt for rescue of person captured by the warehouse, the room locked with grid was in fire, the man did not show sign of life. It was managed to force back the liquid in fire between the two stores (09.12), the fire could not spread further. A part of liquid in fire flew to the lower level underlying building site behind the warehouse, inflaming the tool hut standing on that area and/or endangering four pressure-bottle fixed to the hut. The fire-fighting leader ordered protection and evacuation of bottles, but two of them exploded.The fire-fighting was done continuously by powder-, foam- and water-gusher. It was not managed to form monolithic foam-covering neither with operating foam-gusher and foam-guns together, because the liquid in fire was proved strong antifoam agent, furthermore the storage mode of materials made more difficult of forming the foam-covering (on pallets, above each other). After recognition of antifoam agent the fire-fighting leader ordered the supplementation of foam-forming compound, what would have been justified to be done earlier.The heavy smoke threatened some of the near-by residential houses, therefore action was taken to evacuate 17 person - mainly elder aged people.By 10.10 with involving other emergency units, and/or operating the powder-gusher discontinuously it was managed to stop the fire of liquid on the yard, there were no reinflame. The fire could be controlled inside the building. Meanwhile the foam-forming compound was off, the fire-fighting and cooling continued with water. The sump gullys were occluded by balled fat, the water could not drain. The liquid from the cans exploded spread on the surface of water in seconds, and compassed the gusher leaders, this way suffering burn injuries. At 10.16 arrived the foam-forming compound, the fire-fighting with foam continued. By 10.39 the fire was 90 %, by 10.45 totally extinguished. At 10.45 some heated box under the pallets exploded and the liquid spread reignited the fire, the fire-fighting continued. The flash of liquid spread on surface of water caused injuries again at 10.56.Because of serial reinflames and explosions inside and in the environment of the building the total extinguishing of the fire could not be achieved, but controlling the fire-sources the fire did not spread to larger area. The fire-fighting leader ordered the notice of Water-treatment Company, i. e. huge volume of extinguishing water polluted with high quantity chemicals will arrive to water treatment plant, they were asked to do the actions needed and/or to clean the occluded sump gullys at site. Thanks to the notice on time the responsible persons separated the polluted water, this way no polluted extinguishing water entered the Danube.At 11.25 the mortal remains of victim was found.It was not managed to prevent the evaporation of inflammable liquid spread, causing continuous reinflame, for solving this fireman captain leader of Operative Unit of Department of the Interior's Fire-fighting National Headquarter, proposed forming of 1,5-2 meters high foam-covering, which was a key tactical solution in view of fire-fighting. The foam-covering was formed by AKG-800 foam-maker and with EVAM foam-forming compound. The equipment was used up to now only in oil industry for consolidation of extinguishing of large-surfaced fire, evolved in salvager. The fire and smoke-production stopped in 10 minutes after the equipment arrived at site and operated, producing total foam-covering on the site affected. The produced foam-covering was stable also on morning of next day, there was no need for complementation. The total extinguishing of fire was effected on the whole site and in the building after introducing the foam-covering (22.08).","Trespass of unauthorized person for inhalation of narcotic vapours.It is presumed that a former, drug-addict employee of the company crawled into the warehouse on rest-day, and after inhalation of thinner vapours became stuporous, lighted a cigarette. After this fire started, which in short time spread to the whole warehouse.  ","Area Concerned:Before the fire there were about 80 sort of inflammable and explosive materials in the building.Thanks to quick and precise action the spread of fire to most of near-by buildings could be prevented, saving this way the major part of stocks stored there.The building of warehouse and the major part of materials stored there were destroyed in fire. The neighbouring two stores and/or the outer part of detergent store were lightly damaged, but they are suitable for normal use. The materials stored on pallets on the yard and/or 10.5 tons of detergent was destroyed.People - remarks:10 firemen suffered burn injuries during pool fire and/or during a BLEVE.There were residential zone north and east from the accident site, the smoke containing toxic and carcinogenic compounds endangered these areas. The huge volume product of combustion was spreading toward the side of residential zone, but it was rising quickly and it was thinning. In case of worsening of meteorological conditions there would have been affected approx. 5000 residents inside of a circle of 700 m radius.

During the accident the traffic was managed by the police in the neighbouring streets.Discussion:The 1000 m2 store and the major part of materials stored there were destroyed, the neighbouring storehouses were damaged, too.If the spread of fire to neighbouring storehouses could not be prevented, then it could have incalculable consequences.Affected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of :  Ecological component: residential area (covered by toxic cloud) - Affected YesEcological component: land (with known potential for long term ecological harm or preventing human access or activities) - Affected Yes","The porter alarmed the fire alarm centre of fire-chief headquarters after detecting the fire by direct fire alarm phone. Extinguishing of fire was not attempted by plant personnel until arrival of fire brigade. Porters opened the entrance gates and started alarming the management of the company. The chief of fire alarm centre retrieved the fire-fighting plan of the establishment from the computer database and started execution of prescribed III. Order alarm (alarming 14 units in the first circle). The arriving units performed marching within the norm time arriving at 08:58, there was no adversely effecting factor hindering the marching of fire brigades. The fire-fighting leader confirmed the fire order III classification on the basis of exploration at site, but because of rapid spreading of fire in large area it was classified to V order at 09:06. The fire alarm centre executed the V. order alarming very fast (alarming further 6 units). Involvement of further units were necessary for exchange (from 09:42 9 units) and later for cleanup work and exploration (6 units). Aggregately 36 fire-engines and 143 firemen arrived to the fire site. According to the exploration the storage building was entirely in fire, and the fire was endangering the open air storage area next to the storage building. In spite of quick intervention the propagation of fire could not prevented, the plastic canisters located on palettes were molten and linseed oil stored in canisters burned and like burning lava flow away directly endangering the jet directing firemen and fire-engines. It is necessary to note, that the fire-chief was not aware of the content of plastic canisters, he got no information regarding this matter at site. The burning liquid spilled in the yard endangered the two neighboring buildings (paint storages), spreading the fire to these buildings would result in incalculable consequences. Because of rapid spreading of fire the alarm classification the fire-fighting leader increased the alarm classification order at 09:06. He concentrated the forces to this place for prevention of propagation of fire.The fire was extinguished using 36 fire engines and 143 firemen during 9 hours 1 minute. The tremendous amount of combustible material, which was stored in different vessels on palettes made the fire-fighting very dangerous and difficult. From the fire signalization arriving in the same time one could come to the conclusion that large fire occurred. The alarm centre made alarming according to the fire fighting plan, made preparation for alarming of forces prescribed for assistance. The exploration was not hindered, the detached storehouse and its surrounding was well-arranged.The fire escalate in very short time to the entire area of the storehouse. The heat radiation was very intensive, but the intervention prevented escalation of fire to the adjacent storehouses. Prevention of damage in the close vicinity of storehouse was not possible, materials, vehicles located there were seriously damaged. Because of stored different type of chemicals there was explosion danger and pollution effect of released combustion products represented serious endangerment for the environment. It was late information for the fire-fighting brigade that person is present in the storehouse. It was problem, that nobody could give information about types of stored materials at site. The fire-fighting management was performed at the beginning by basic management mode, later the by the organization of fire-fighting group. 4 brigades were organized: 1-1 brigade on the left and right sides of the storehouse 1 brigade for ensuring fire-fighting material supply1 brigade for ensuring fire -fighting water supply.The role of management staff which was complemented with principals arriving to the site was consultative, because of static fire-fighting situation. Good co-operation between management staff and fire-fighting leader facilitated the success of new tactical solution used at first time. Combined extinguishing method was determined for extinguishing of the fire: extinguishing with powder -gusher, foam-gusher and foam jets the cooling with water jets. Using powder gushers burning of liquid spilled in the yard managed to cease, and fire in the storehouse partly control. The very intensive foam braking effect of burning materials no foam cover could formed, because 80-90% of foam was destroyed in short time. Operation of 12-15 simultaneous foam jet would be required for successful fire-fighting, but only one foam-gusher was available on duty in the capital. The series of explosion of storage vessels reignited several times the already extinguished fire. Use of AKG-800 foam-maker for forming ensured successful fire-extinguishing because of 1,5-2 meters high foam-covering. The large weight of AKG-800 foam-maker and its manual transportation in very dangerous site represented large difficulty; the fire members of fire-fighting group had no previous information about the equipment. Injuries occurred in spite of necessary care and disciplined observation of accident prevention measures, serious injury did not occurred, fast reaction of gusher-leaders saved colleagues in danger. Heat resistant protective clothing was not used, because it was obvious that the fire extinguishing will take longer than 20 minutes time. Heat resistant protective clothing the visibility is restricted, the movement is hard, in case of present fire observation of large area and fast reaction was necessary because of rapid changes. As result of high heat radiation the external surface of conventional protective coat was melted. The medical ambulance cars of emergency department ensured the treatment and transportation to hospital of injured people. The police closed down properly the surrounding area, executed the necessary traffic control. The police took part in information and rescuing of residential people, ensuring the public order. Experts of Sewage Company On The Basis Of received in time information took the necessary measures, as a result no contaminated fire-fighting water entered into the river Danube. Food supply of fire-fighting staff working continuously for many hours was not properly organised, 4 hours was necessary to organise the requested food supply by on duty officer of the Fire-Fighting Headquarter. ","Measures to prevent recurrence: Strengthening the surveillance safety. There are few tools available for fire prevention of such and similar actions. The fire protection authority shall make the necessary measures during installation of facility, compliance with regulations and observing the operation instructions determined by plant shall be checked. It is suggested that during fire protection authority's inspection more emphasis shall be exercised to inspection of fire protection activity of the companies. The stereotyped fire protection instructions of the companies using only general terms shall be requested to be reviewed, and reworked in compliance with concrete fire protection requirements of given activity. Measures to mitigate consequences: It was proven, that high capacity foam makers might be necessary in the territory of capital. It was initiated to produce such foam makers for the capital. It is possible to reduce by seconds or minutes the time elapsing between arrival of fire signalization and initiating the fire alarm by expansion of computer system of Alarm Centre of Fire-Fighting Headquarter. It is necessary to provide suitable generally usable working clothes, boots and protective coat for the on duty staff. It is necessary to ensure protective drinks and meals supply system for staff working at accident site. "
854,588,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Accident during the distillation of a crude nitro-imidazole compound under vacuum in a pilot-plant,1989-06-28 16:00:00,1989-06-28 00:00:00,"The explosion demolished the dividing walls between the pilot plant and the laboratory and the main process area causing extensive damages to equipment therein. The roof of the pilot plant was destroyed. The factory is in an industrial estate on basically level ground. The day was dry with calm conditions. Smoke from the fires drifted towards a nearby town about 2 km away. The 450 l glass lined reactor was built in 1979 according to B.S. 1500. It was tested and certified in 1980 and installed in 1980. The reactor was used for chemical reactions at atmospheric pressure or distillations under vacuum over a range of temperatures. On July 28, 154 kg of crude 1-methyl-2-formyl 1-nitroimidazole were loaded in the reactor and heated with heating medium at 100 degrees Celsius, with the intention of dropping the hot liquid into 20 litres glass distillation bowls. These bowls would then be used in the pilot plant distillation unit. Distillation of the crude product at 100 degrees Celsius under vacuum had shown by laboratory trials to yield pure product. When the solid lumps of crude product were almost dissolved, the reactor's agitator was turned on. Shorlty afterwards the mixture began to boil up. A yellow fume began to emerge from the closed man-hole. The pilot plant operator exit quickly and within seconds 2 successive explosions were heard. Process plant on both the first floor and ground floor pilot plant was severely damaged. The roof of the pilot plant was blown off. The internal walls between the pilot plant and laboratory and the process area were blown down. External walls were severely damaged and two window frames were blown out. Glass windows were shattered up to 30 m away. Missiles from the pilot plant were projected up to 60 m away. The head of the process reactor was projected through the roof and landed about 30 m away while the bottom portion was projected from the first floor area down to the ground floor area and embedded in the floor. One person working in the adjacent main production area received shoulder injuries resulting from a fall. Another person suffered a slight cut and shock. Although there was no damage off-site the sound of the explosion was heard some distance away. In a town 2 km away windows were shaken and the noise caused considerable public concern.","CAUSES:
The explosion occurred during the heating of 1-methyl- 2-formyl-1-nitroimidazole at 100 degrees Celsius in a closed reactor under vacuum. The explosion was caused by the decomposition of the product due to the heating. As the liquid level in the reactor was below the temperature probe, its exact temperature was unknown. It was thought that it was below 100 degrees Celsius of the heating medium in the reactor's jacket. The company was concerned about the potential explosive properties of the compound due to the presence of a nitro- group and recognised the need for explosivity tests. At the time of the explosion they had not done these tests. The material was an intermediate and no health and safety information was available. The substance was still at pilot plant trials stage and the company intended to compile the relevant data if the process developped to full production scale.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:2 people were slightly injured by the explosion: one person working in
the adjacent main production area received shoulder injuries resulting
from a fall; another person suffered a slight cut and shock.MATERIAL LOSS:Extensive damage to plant and internal/external walls. Around the pilot plant also roof damage and some glass damage to windows of the main building and to cars in the company car park. The cost of the damage has been estimated at about 0.65M Euros.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The smoke from the fire and the explosion drifted slowly (calm day) towards a nearby town. It slowly dispersed over a number of hours. No smoke monitoring was carried out but the public was concerned. The manufacturer allayed the public's fears by stating on national radio and TV that the smoke was not toxic.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The extents of the effects are shown on a map attached to the Original Report. Only industrial population in the adjacent area. No significant overpressure were observed off-site. Glass breakage was confined to a 30 m radius within the site. The windows of houses in the town 2 km away shook (blast effects compared to 2.5 kg TNT equivalent approximately).Disruption of community life: No significant overpressure were observed off-site but the windows of the houses in the town 2 km away shook. The smoke from the fire and the explosion drifted slowly (calm day) towards the nearby town and dispersed over a number of hours. No smoke monitoring was carried out but the public was concerned. The manufactures allayed the public's fears by stating on national radio and TV that the smoke was not toxic. The policemen evacuated two nearby factory units.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the explosion occurred all personnel went to the assembly area in accordance with the site's emergency plan. The company fire crew equipped with breathing apparatuses, put out small fires. They were aided by the local fire emergency services. Three units of the local fire brigade arrived on the scene and found
that the fire was under control. Approximately 5 fire brigade personnel
aided the company fire crew in the pilot plant area. One fire brigade
crew remained on-site for two hours until the ""all-clear"" was given.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Approximately 3-5 policemen closed off the access road to the factory. Three units of the local fire brigade arrived on the scene and found that the fire was under control. Approximately 5 fire brigade personnel aided the company fire crew in the pilot plant area. One fire brigade crew remained on-site for two hours until the ""all clear"" was given. The policemen evacuated two nearby factory units. Total number of people evacuated was approximately 300. The smoke from the fire and the explosion drifted slowly (calm day) towards the nearby town of Shannon. It slowly dispersed over a number of hours. No smoke monitoring was carried out but the public was concerned. The manufacturer allayed the public's fears by stating on national radio and TV that the smoke was not toxic.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",Measures to prevent recurrence: The company has discontinued research and development work for the foreseeable future and have to concentrate their activities on existing processes. The hazard evaluation of these processes is being reviewed prior to recommencement of each in turn. If the company reintroduces research and development work on new processes it will be done only after that a satisfactory programme is put in place to ensure an adequate hazard evaluation at each stage.
855,622,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Jet fire from a mechanical rupture in a compressor unit of an isomerisation plant,2002-12-27 15:00:00,2002-12-27 16:50:00,"At 15:03 hrs in the isomerisation unit a mechanical rupture in one out of two compressors occurred. The compressors, which were working in parallel and were operating at a pressure of 20 bars, were dedicated to conveying the gas mixture needed for the isomerisation process. The rupture caused the release of a gas mixture containing hydrogen, which on coming into contact with air ignited forming a jet fire. The jet fire headed towards the adjacent benzene saturation (BenSat) section hitting the nearest equipment (a pressure vessel) located 14 m from the release point. Weakening of the BenSat structure, consequent release of benzene from these structures and extension of the fire, with substantial destruction of the section. The length of the jet-fire could not be calculated with precision because the flame hit against the nearby BenSat unit; if the jet had not been stopped by the BenSat unit, it could have had an estimated length of approximately 30 m.Off-site fire brigade teams intervened extinguishing the fire within approximately 1 hour and a half of work. No damage was reported to persons or to the environment.","The accident was caused by the mechanical rupture of the bottom of the reciprocating compressor in the isomerisation section. This rupture was probably caused by a failure of the crank mechanism made of piston rod and drive shaft that caused the beating of the piston on the cylinder-bottom of the compressor. The combined effect of the beating and of the operation pressure may have caused the failure of the nuts holding the cylinder bottom; the following energy release threw the cylinder bottom weighing 100 kg approximately 14 meters away.Due to the fact that the process control records did not register significant changes in the process parameters it has to be assumed that the failure of the crank mechanism was caused by aspects linked to maintenance or by a material defect.At time of this report investigations were being performed on the material fragments of the failed crank components. An official systematic investigation on the failure cause with an expert appointed by the court is expected.The clearance in the compressor between piston and cylinder bottom is 3 mm. According to the declarations of the operator, it appears evident that a mechanical interference between cylinder bottom and drive shaft may have occurred.The nuts holding the failed cylinder bottom were found with completely abraded threads whereas the bolts on the contrary were practically undamaged and a few were just slightly blackened.The flammable gas mixture was probably ignited by the beating and the friction of the failed crank mechanism or by an electrostatic charge built up through gas seepage.","Substantial destruction of the BenSat unit; only a small part of the equipment could be recovered. In the isomerisation unit the loss of the compressor was registered, the compressor had practically to be completely substituted and was taken back into service in June 2003. For some months the isomerisation unit worked only with compressor K2901A.

At time of this report a quantification of the repair costs was not possible.The accident could have caused more severe damage without the adoption of effective response measures and the joint effort of the on-site personnel and the off-site fire brigades; even if the on-site emergency response organisation could be improved.Affected Area: installation","The emergency response operation was managed by the fire brigade of Rome in collaboration with the on-site personnel.At approximately 15:00 hrs a loud anomalous noise coming from the isomerisation unit was heard by the personnel working near that unit. Reaching the place the person in charge realised that the noise was caused by compressor K-2901B and tried to stop the compressor via the emergency shut-off switch installed on the control panel near the compressor, then he went to the control room to order the activation of the emergency shut-down procedure, with the activation of the discharge system into the fuel-gas network and the rapid depressurisation by the blow down system.Immediately afterwards the violent release of a hydrogen rich gas mixture occurred from the compressor bottom, the jet ignited almost instantly and hit the adjoining part of the BenSat plant (approximately 14m). The refinery personnel closed the manual valves installed on the pipe mains and started extinguishing operations, activating the fixed cooling systems and the foaming system of the units involved and nearby units.Meanwhile (at 15:03 hrs) the onsite Emergency Control Centre team gathered and established communication with the Advanced Control Centre. At 15:12 hrs the Emergency Control Centre decided to alert the off-site fire brigade. Meanwhile the on-site emergency response team fought the fire from the southeast with a fixed high capacity monitor, from the south with two UNI45 extinguishing hoses, another fixed monitor positioned in the southwest, an extinguishing lorry with a monitor positioned on the northwest, two UNI170 extinguishing hoses in the northeast.At 15:16 hrs the Emergency Control Centre ordered the emergency shut-down procedure to be started for the entire establishment.At 15:30 the first off-site fire brigade team arrived on-site and started to support response operations on the north side, which was more exposed due to the wind blowing from the south and a major presence of fixed extinguishing systems on the south side.The size of the fire was greatly reduced by 15:50 because the compression section of the plant no longer fed the fire; the fire continued in the BenSat unit engulfing it with flames.At 16:25 the fire was practically extinguished, some small flames remained on the highest points; cooling operations continued. At 16:50 the emergency was called off.Meanwhile, at 15:26, the Mayor's office, the Carabinieri and the Prefecture were informed about the occurrence. During the emergency also the 118 - (sanitary emergency call number) intervened at 15:45 hrs. On-site, besides the Fire Brigade Commander of Rome, and the General Fire Brigade Inspector of the Latium Region, also the Prefect and a journalist from the news of the third national Television chain arrived at the refinery (respectively at 16:49 hrs and at 16:52 hrs); representatives from the police headquarters also arrived.Official action taken - legal action: At time of the present report a confrontation was in progress between the company and the supplier of the compressor. An official systematic investigation into the failure cause was expected to be started, subject to appointment of a consultant by the civil court of Rome. 
The company had already requested a technical expert opinion.


","Measures to prevent recurrence: Corrective actions on the On-site Emergency Response ManagementEquipment-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compressor orientation-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vibration detection system-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; automatic cut-off valves at the compressor intake-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; functionality and location of the automatic shut-down buttons-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electric powering system and sectioningEmergency response planning and management-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; number and placing of the water and foam dispensers of the fixed extinguishing systems-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; number and placing of the monitors-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; performance of the extinguishing system in terms of delivery and capacity of the water supply-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accessibility of the hazardous areas with extinguishing equipment-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; performance of the extinguishing systems of the refinery and accessibility of appropriate personal protective equipment for the emergency response teams.- appointment of an interdepartmental working group, with the assignment to issue or supplement the emergency response procedures so as to better define the tasks both of the single emergency response team members as well as the tasks of operative personnel in charge of sectioning and shutting down the installations. The procedures will comprise specific checklists, made available also to the Emergency Control Centre, which will be more efficient in following and supporting operations on the field.- verify the sewage system with respect to the suitability to cope with emergencies- prepare a portable radio communication system, for use only during emergencies, in order to improve communication during emergency response operations.- optimise the availability and location of personal protective equipment- increase the possible intervention points, numerically insufficient- increase the flow rate of the extinguishing water network, verify the performance of the extinguishing water network in terms of flow rate and water storage capacity.With reference to the experience gained and the updating studies carried out the following measures are planned by the company:Structures and equipment:- substitute the reciprocating compressors with a single centrifugal compressor in view of developing the isomerisation unit;-adopt electrically driven shut-off valves at the intake to be mounted near the compressor (the old valves were manually driven), so as to significantly limit any possible gas leakage;- improve the placing of hydrants and fixed monitors. Concerning management and documentation aspects:- improve the localisation of personal protective equipment;- improve the training of the personnel concerning the management of emergencies; systematic call-up of the emergency response team with drills every 15 days;- define for all equipment the sequence of operations needed to secure the equipment;- overhaul the electric securing systems of the machines, defined as a priority with respect to securing the process equipment;- update the risk analysis carried out for the safety report;- start the necessary procedures to tune the on-site emergency plan to the accident scenarios identified in the safety report."
856,433,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Sulphur chloride and dense white smoke  blown out through the manhole during a tank rinsing,1993-05-13 13:30:00,1993-05-13 14:30:00,"At the beginning of the afternoon, the operator decided to clean the inside of a tank, usually containing sulphur chloride, with water. The tank was scheduled for repair works after the detection of an incipient crack on a weld. 2 days before the accident, the tank had been emptied and isolated. A 400 mm diameter manhole  was left half open. A connecting piping between the tank roof and an adsorption column captured the hydrochloric acid vapours. A more or less dense sludge, with an average thickness of 60 mm, was deposited on the bottom of the tank. The sludge contained corrosion products, sulphur chloride and a variety of other impurities. The day of the accident, at 13:30 h, a flexible hose was introduced  through the half-open manhole cover for the rinsing operation. The water flow was 2 l/s. After one minute, a dense white smoke  was blown out through the manhole. The water injection was stopped. The amount of vapour released was later estimated at 80 kg. The emission stopped 5 minutes after interrupting the water injection in the tank. The capacity of the adsorption column was sufficient to capture the residual vapours.","Although there have not been any serious off-site consequences, it is evident that the hazards of the neutralisation reaction were seriously underestimated during  the preparation of the repair operation. The current gas treatment installation used for gas released during cleaning operations is under-sized and the water curtain systems installed on the boundaries of the plant cannot completely avoid the atmospheric release of a vapour cloud containing water and hydrochloric acid.
The operators did not think that the acid vapour cloud had crossed the perimeter of the plant and did not inform the management.
","The cloud containing hydrochloric acid and sulphur dioxide which was not abated by the water curtains (sprinkling system), was shifted by the wind, and touched  the ground in the form of a fog or small acid water droplets. At 1.150 km from the plant, the pupils of a school were reached by the fallout in the playground. Several were affected and 24 of them were evacuated by the fire brigade to the nearest hospital between 14:20 h and 15:30 h. A medical examination determined the lack of any danger.","Specific operative instructions, clearly describing the procedures to be followed, had been issued a long time before the event. The instructions provided for in particular the setting up of significant means to fight an eventual release of acid vapours (aspiration, water curtains, monitors, sprinklers, etc. ). However, as explained before, the flow capacity of the water curtains was under-sized.
The local fire brigade intervened half an hour after the accident started (14:05 h), called by the headmaster of the school to assist the pupils. The inspection of classified installations was taken over by the warning system of the fire fighting at 14:28h. It took 2h to identify the establishment where the accident had occurred. 
","The following actions were undertaken:- modification of the response procedures,- increase of the personnel awareness on accident hazards,- improvement of the emergency communication in case of an accident.Following the inspection, an infraction report was issued against the operators due to the failure to inform the management and to organise emergency response measures in the case of an accident affecting the environment. A safety report has to be drawn up in the context of a new authorisation procedure as a condition for restarting the installation."
857,1197,Major Accident,Mining activities (tailings & physicochemical processes),Aurul gold mine dam accident Baia Mare 2000,2000-01-30 00:00:00,2000-02-28 00:00:00,"On 30 January 2000 at 22:00, the dam surrounding the waste lake at one of the sub-units belonging to Aurul SA in Baia Mare, north-west of Romania, ruptured. This caused a discharge of approximately 100,000 m3 of liquid and waste containing between 50 and 100 t of cyanide as well as heavy metals including copper. The rupture was probably caused by a combination of design errors of the facilities used by Aurul, unexpected operating conditions and adverse weather conditions. Contaminated run-off travelled through the Săsar, Lăpuș, Someș, Tisa and Danube rivers before reaching the Black Sea 4 weeks later. Almost 2000 kilometres of the Danube and its tributaries were affected by the run-off.","The rupture in the dam was caused by a combination of intrinsic process design flaws and unforeseen operating conditions linked to adverse weather conditions. The pond wall was built using processed coarse-grade tailings, an operational method that requires a safe range between the height of the dam and the water level in the pond. In the case of the new pond at Baia Mare, there was an imbalance between the flow of solids and water on the one hand, and the increase in the storage capacity of the pond on the other, as the pond construction process could not keep pace with the rising water levels in the reservoir. The weather conditions of the winter season exacerbated the situation and led to an uncontrolled increase in the level of the pond and subsequently led to the spillage over the dam.","Environmental factors were affected by the accident as both cyanide and heavy metals had an impact on aquatic fauna and polluted the drinking water.The methods used for the analysis of cyanide and heavy metals across the three countries affected produced comparable results in line with international standards. Differences in results emerged between Romanian and Hungarian scientists, but these can be explained by the time and place of the tests. Moreover, an independent test was carried out by the United Nations three weeks after the wave of harmful substances had passed and therefore cannot validate any of the results obtained by Romanian, Hungarian and Yugoslavian [sic] experts while the wave was passing.Results show that cyanide and heavy metals concentration levels decreased rapidly as the distance from the origin of the spill increased. The cyanide had acute effects on the long sections of the riverbeds to the point where the Tisa and Danube rivers meet. The plankton (plants and animals) was wiped out by the passing cyanide wave and fish died during or immediately after the cyanide wave passed. In Hungary, lead, copper, manganese and iron levels were found to be very high at several points along the Tisa and Mureș rivers. In the Mureș river, which was not affected by the spillage, lead levels were found to be four times higher than the acceptable level. In Yugoslavia [sic], on the stretch before the intersection of the Tisa and the Danube, the concentration of lead was found to be very high. Manganese and iron levels were found to be slightly higher in certain parts of the Tisa. Similarly zinc levels were found to be slightly higher in certain parts of the Danube.","In the hours and days following the accident, the following measures were taken:

local and central authorities were informed, as were the Hungarian authorities;
partial closure of the dam (31 January 2000 - 2 February 2000, 1:30 a.m.) followed by the restoration and strengthening of the pond wall;
neutralisation of leaked water with sodium hypochlorite;
monitoring water quality by carrying out systematic tests of rivers and sources of drinking water;
supplying inhabitants of Bozanta Mare with drinking water;
discharge of water from the Aurul pond into the Remin pond (situated nearby) and, after neutralisation, into the Lăpuş river in order to maintain a constant level of water in the pond.

The measures taken by the Hungarian authorities included public warnings, work in the ponds and lakes to ensure the protection of tributaries and fauna, the temporary closure of the Kiskore dam (upper Tisa) to increase water levels and the temporary closure of the Tisa water intake for the city of Szolnok. The dam was reopened when the contaminated water arrived, in order to allow it to rapidly pass through, thus preventing the contamination of the lake and secondary watercourses.Yugoslavia received an official communication from Hungary about the leak on 3 February. Cooperation with Hungary was good throughout the leak incident. Yugoslavia began monitoring the leakage on 10 February and, concurrently, Yugoslav authorities launched a call for water companies to inform all consumers and to close all water supply points. Hydraulic gates prevented cyanide leakage from affecting secondary channels and watercourses along the Danube.A ban was placed on fishing and the sale of fish and publicly announced. Other preventive measures taken to protect public health were put in place, including the closure of Belgrade’s water supply. The information exchanges between Romanian, Hungarian and Yugoslav authorities, as well as the measures taken by all three countries, including the temporary closure of the Tisa dam, reduced the harmful impact of the leakage.","
Increased need for objective and accurate information, in particular from local authorities and the media, was identified. Communication channels must be improved and NGOs and other interest groups must contribute to informing the public.
An emergency plan for an improved system must be drawn up and made known to local workers and decision-makers. Organisational responsibilities with regard to future instances of dam ruptures must be made clear. Rapid-response emergency alarms must be put in place, especially in Baia Mare.
It is necessary to identify sources of drinking water in case of an emergency, to carry out a study on the health of the population living in the affected areas and to monitor diseases caused by water pollution. Last but not least, drinking water supply systems for private households in Maramureș County must be replaced by public supply systems, accompanied by waste treatment systems.

858,478,Major Accident,Plastic and rubber manufacture,Release of hydrocyanic acid from a chemical production plant,2000-03-29 00:00:00,2000-03-29 00:00:00,"On a chemical  platform, a release of hydrocyanic acid occurred in a unit for the synthesis of hydrocyanic acid, belonging to the unit for the production of adiponitrile.

The release is small but the lessons learned with regard to the organisational aspects of the installation are interesting. The accident is therefore notified only for this reason, since the criteria of Annex VI are not fulfilled.

The accident is classified at level 0 of the gravity scale, based on the available information.The accident:The accident occurred on the HCN production installations, at the level of a mist separator placed on the residual gas transfer line between the head of the HCN absorption tower and the CNIM boiler.Several incidents had occurred during the previous days:- Problems in extracting liquids at the base of the HCN purification tower (tower H2243) from March 20 to 26 made it necessary to use a second pump. On March 27th, the decision was taken to shutdown the distillation train to clean the HCN polymers that had formed.The shut-down procedure foresaw:&nbsp;- draining the HCN from the train, up to 2% HCN in the drainage water, by directing it toward the ADN unit,- performing air stripping until an HCN concentration is reached which allows the equipment to be opened, the residual gases being burned in the CNIM boiler.On March 28 and 29, the distillation train was drained (shut-down of the HCN converters, as well as the natural gas heaters and the upstream TGN). Draining remained difficult due to extraction problems at the base of tower H2243. On March 29th at 13:00, the decision was taken to switch over to the air stripping phase.The concentration of 1.2% HCN in the towers, measured at the base of tower H2242, was higher than the usual values although it was below the threshold value of 5% tolerated during the operating mode.In compliance with the safety procedures, the workshop was evacuated on March 29th at 16:15 p.m. before the stripping operation was launched. The order to evacuate was cancelled 15 minutes later and 9 people returned to the workshop.The explosion occurred at 16:40 at the level of the mist separator H1191 located at 5 m height on the gas line.The two nearest analysers (Toxguard) located at a distance of 10 and 15 m indicated 30 ppm of HCN; the concentration values dropped after 5 minutes. Other equipment located 100 m from the unit sporadically detected values in the order of 4 to 5 ppm of HCN.The shop personnel were evacuated to a withdrawal zone and the stripping operation was shut down immediately. At 16:45 the unit's Toxguard detector detected a HCN concentration higher than 5 ppm and triggered alarm, the 300 people present in the establishment were ordered to shelter. The on-site emergency plan was put into operation at the same time and the on-site fire-brigade intervened with SCBA (self contained breathing apparatus). Water curtains were set up around the installations.HCN concentrations measured outside the workshop were below 2ppm.The header line of the HCN absorption tower was isolated from tower H2241 at 17:30. Only the Toxguard near the separator unit still indicated a concentration of 15 ppm of HCN 30 min later. ","The analysis of the accident was conducted by an interdisciplinary work group. Its potential causes were examined&nbsp; using the failure tree method. A safe-T-tree was then constructed after having eliminated the highly improbable potential causes: a flashback produced from the boiler was stopped by the separator tank (H1191).According to the operator, the accident was caused by:&nbsp;- the presence of polymers in the tower which slowed down the drainage of HCN,&nbsp; - at the start of the air stripping phase, an operation conducted with an HCN content higher than normal in the residual gases, the normal drainage of the trains not having been conducted,&nbsp; - the presence of several inconsistencies in the implementation procedure:&nbsp;- since 1989, the stripping procedure has consisted of a blocking phase based on a safety threshold level set at 5% HCN in liquid phase. This threshold is erroneous, stripping at 10°C with an HCN concentration &gt; 1.2% in the liquid leading the lower explosive limit (LEL = 6%) of the hydrocyanic acid in gas phase to be reached. At the time of the accident, the HCN concentration of the liquid at the base of tower H2242 was 1.2%, compatible with the threshold.&nbsp;- the sample of liquid analysed at the base of tower H2242, containing 1.2% HCN, was not representative of the real HCN amount of the train.A posteriori, the average concentration of the amount analysed was 2%.&nbsp;- the gas phase HCN analyser present at the tower head was not adapted and did not allow the operators to be alerted. The device was limited to ""normal"" operating ranges: alarm at 0.9% and no measurement beyond 1.2%.&nbsp;- the operating mode did not explicitly indicate the action to be taken for a concentrationgreater than 0.9%.By reducing the air outputs, the operators:- reduced the speed of the gases in the line toward the boiler,- promoted flashback,- increased the HCN content in the air and the risk of exceeding the L.E.L.",The operator evaluated the quantity of HCN released into the atmosphere at 25 kg and the property damage was limited: the line to the boiler was expanded over 1m in length and a the collar of the separator tank was ripped over 400 cm².No consequences were observed on the personnel and the plant's environment.,"Since at 19:00 no consequences for the personnel or the environment had been reported, the operator decides not to activate the off-site (external) emergency plan, and the internal contingency&nbsp; plan is terminated, while the order for the employees' confinement is withdrawn.The inspectorate for classified installations (DRIRE) and the mayors of the 3 neighbouring Municipalities were informed, but the prefecture was not&nbsp; informed by the operator.","On April 5th, the classified installations inspectorate (DRIRE) requested that the operator submit an accident report, as well as the measures taken or to be taken and to check if this type of accident had been contemplated within the scope of the project of extension.On April 10th, the operator presented the inspectorate with the conclusions of his post-accident analysis and the measures taken or which would be implemented in the near future in order to prevent recurrence of such an accident. It took note of these measures and no objection was made concerning putting the installations back into service.The cleaning of the installations, the repair of the separator unit and the damaged piping, followed by the progressive restarting of the HCN shop, then the TGN, took place from Monday 10th through Thursday 13th April, 2000.Corrective actions at first proposed by the operator:&nbsp;* Immediate modification of the shutdown procedure,&nbsp;* Immediate replacement of air by nitrogen during stripping,&nbsp;* Installation of an analyser in the column's gas exhaust which is independent of the analyser used for the process, and which triggers the emergency shut-down of the stripping process if HCN concentrations &gt; 0.9% are detected,&nbsp;* Installation of a flame protection system between the mist separator and the boiler, in order to avoid any flashbacks.After several further requests, the following additional elements were adopted:&nbsp;* The internal emergency plan is modified: The prefecture, the Regional Directorate For Industry, Research and Environment (DRIRE -- Direction REgionale de l'Industrie, de la Recherche et de l'Environnement), and the police will be informed about any gas alarm (even if triggered at very low concentrations) if it lasts longer than 30 min.;&nbsp;* A flame protection system will be installed upstream of the boiler with the next major shutdown of the installations;&nbsp;* The operating mode is modified for the phases following the exhaustion of the HCN reaction chain &nbsp;- in order to reduce the HCN concentration below the LEL concentrations, stripping is begun with nitrogen in the liquid as well as in the gas phase&nbsp;- Change over to air stripping for concentrations below 0.7%;&nbsp;- Lowering of the alarm threshold and installation of a safety system acting on the backflow rate (recirculated rate of flow) of the liquid phase;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Stripping will be continued until a HCN concentration of 1 ppm in the liquid phase is reached.&nbsp;* Moreover, the operator proposes improving the sprinkling with acidic solution inside the column in order to avoid the risk of polymerisation caused by low acidity.&nbsp;* Analysis of two possible worsening scenarios for the accident of 29 March 2000:&nbsp;- shut-off failure of the tank valves: the release would have continued with 1 t/h of N2 with 2,6% of HCN, i.e. with 26 kg/h of HCN and a lethal limit zone (ZOLEM zone limite effets mortels) below 50 m;&nbsp;- Propagation of the explosion beyond the .droplet separation vessel up to the .absorption column head and bursting of the latter.

859,817,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Leak from a steel pipe of an isobutane recycle stream,1986-05-15 09:00:00,1986-05-15 00:00:00,"ENVIRONMENT AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Moderate breeze blew released gas away from the plant and nearby installations.
Owing to corrosion in an isobutane recycle piping system, a leak of
isobutane containing traces of hydrogen fluoride occurred (code 1101).
The gas cloud dispersed safely without igniting (it was diluted below
the low flammable limit within a few tens of metres from the source
leak).The leak occurred during normal refinery operation. Automatic detectors sensed the leak and sounded the alarm more or less simultaneously with a plant operator on patrol noticing it. He immediately confirmed the nature of the release to shift emergency controller who decided that in the short term a substantial release of LPG containing traces of hydrofluoric acid could not be avoided. After activating the emergency isolation and depressurisation procedures, he alerted the works fire team and lost no time in calling the local fire brigade to assist in the deployment of fire monitors which would deluge water into the affected area. Because of their familiarity with the plant and their long-standing liaison with the works fire team, the brigade had at least 20 monitors set up in record time. It was then a matter of maintaining water supplies while the plant could be depressurised sufficiently to allow temporary repairs. This critical stage lasted for about an hour. The flare stacks were used to vent down the alkylation plant. A moderate breeze blew released gas away from the plant and nearby installations. Gas cloud diluted below the flammable limit within a few tens of metres from the source of release.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:A small corrosion hole (0.00019 m2) formed in the recycle pipe. The escaped gas was immediately detected by automatic detectors and a plant operator.CAUSES:Examination of the ASME A106 (8"" bore) x 8mm grade 13 steel pipe revealed that a plug of rust and sludge (containing 9.9% FeF2, 8.1% FeF3 and 37.5% Fe2O3) accumulated in base of a shallow bend. The retention of HF in this plug caused accelerated internal corrosion in a localized zone around the surface of the plug. The pipe formed part of the original installation which had been in use for about 5 years; generally corrosion was uniform and within the tolerances allowed for the recycle circuits of the plant. The possibility of this phenomenon was not identified during the process analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; ",OTHER:No material losses occurred except released isobutane and hydrogen fluoride.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The shift emergency controller activated the on-site emergency plan and alerted the works fire team and lost no time in calling the local fire brigade to assist in the deployment of fire monitors which would deluge water into the affected area. Because of their familiarity with the plant and their long-standing liaison with the works fire team, the brigade had at least 20 monitors set up in record time. It was then a matter of maintaining water supplies while the plant could be depressurised sufficiently to allow temporary repairs. This critical stage lasted for about an hour. The flare stacks were used to vent down the alkylation plant. Eventually a mechanical clamp was attached to the pipe to seal it.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The off-site emergency plan was not activated.Emergency measures - Remarks: Automatic detectors, at the same time with a plant operator, sensed the gas leak and sounded the alarm (code 7106). The shift emergency controller activated the on-site emergency plan (code 7100) and the alkylation unit was isolated and depressurized (code 7104). The trained company fire fighters were employed (code 7107) in using fixed and portable water deluge monitors to aid the dispersion of the leaking gas (code 7102). The off-site emergency services were informed and the local fire brigade sent equipments and men to assist in the deluge operations (codes 7201 and 7102). The off-site emergency plan was not activated (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the provision of automatic and/or remote control on a number of valves to speed up isolation and depressurization procedures was established.Measures to mitigate consequences: Provision of automatic and/or remote control on a number of valves to speed up the isolation and depressurization procedures."
860,559,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Loss of containment from the agitator nozzle flange on the top of a vessel processing cyclohexane,2006-02-19 05:55:00,2006-02-19 08:30:00,The incident resulted in a loss of containment of cyclohexane.  Exact quantities are not clear at present but best estimates are in the region of 10 to 24 tonnes.  Total plant inventory is 1100 tonnes.  The qualifying quantity is 50 tonnes as the material is held above its boiling point.,"The exact circumstances are still under investigation but the basic facts are as follows:The incident occurred at an agitated process vessel which processes cyclohexane on a continuous basis at high temperature, i.e. above boiling point. The cyclohexane vapour escaped from an agitator nozzle flange on the top of the vessel. The failure occurred because the agitator suffered some damage, which caused the agitator shaft to distort, applying stress on the flange, loosening the studs, and allowing the flange to lift and the vapour to escape.The release was detected by a flammable vapour detector sited close to the agitator, which alarmed in the control room. Operators went out onto site to investigate and could see that a cloud of cyclohexane vapour was filling a proportion of the plant structure and was also drifting off the installation, although vapours were not seen to travel beyond the site boundary.The operators initiated the Emergency Response Procedure. The release was tackled by:(1) attending the site of the incident and setting up water sprays to cool and knock down the vapour cloud; and(2) initiating a shut down and depressurisation of the system to restrict the quantity released.","There were no injuries or lasting environmental harm, and no disruption to the local community.&nbsp; Those employees who carried out the emergency response were shaken, and some suffered the effects of inhalation of vapours but were otherwise unharmed. The material loss was difficult to calculate because the loss was relatively small compared to the size of the plant inventory.The lack of disruption was partly due to the time of day, i.e, 6.00 am on a Sunday morning.The plant suffered some consequential damage, which resulted in it being shut down for repairs. ","The on-site emergency response procedures were followed.&nbsp; The off-site response was not invoked.The release was identified quickly by gas detectors located close to the source of the release. The plant operators and the Wilton site fire team drenched the vapour cloud with water sprays. The control room shut down and depressurised the plant. The County Fire Brigade came to site and observed.The release was brought under control within about one hour, and the incident was closed down within 2 hours 30 minutes.",The risk of similar failure in the same vessel and in an identical vessel was addressed before start up by removal of the agitators from the system.&nbsp; The process will run without agitation.The risk of similar failure in other agitated vessels on plant was addressed before start up by carrying out inspection of existing agitators on site.&nbsp; No others were identified of a similar design. Maintenance regimes were reviewed in the light of the incident.The emergency response was reviewed before start up and changes were made to procedures.An investigation into the root causes and overall standard of control and mitigation measures is underway.

This caused the gangway to become abruptly disconnected and to sway, so that it collided with the valves.","While replacing a metal gangway straddling four horizontal storage tanks, the crane operator caused a collision with the valves of three of the cylinders. The crane operator had trouble lifting the dismounted equipment he was handling and increased the lifting tension. This caused the gangway to become abruptly disconnected and to sway, so that it collided with the valves. During the process the crane operator, a subcontractor of the outside company handling the work, was guided by two people.",No victims. 12 tonnes of propane were released into the atmosphere.,"The site was secured and the automatic sprinkler system was activated. The internal operating plan was launched at 9:45; the rescue services were alerted and gas detection measures reinforced. A security perimeter was established and three neighbouring buildings occupied by members of the police force and their families (150 people) were evacuated. Traffic on the N193 was interrupted, which affected access to the airport and caused disturbances for 50% of passengers at boarding. Firemen regularly measure the amount of combustible and explosive gases at and outside the site. The liquid phases of LPG are emptied by fire trucks and removed by clients. LPG is transferred between the storage tanks in question gradually as the valves of each tank are replaced after they have been put under atmospheric pressure. As valves needed to be delivered for the repair of the third tank, it was taken out of service. During the emptying phase, the walls of the retention troughs and the related compressed air networks broke under pressure from the water accumulated during the sprinkling of the tanks; when the bleed valves lost their air supply, they closed automatically and consequently the transfer of propane was stopped until the personnel could restore the network. Road traffic was re-established at 21:30 once the situation was under control. The internal operating plan was lifted at 5:30 the next morning and the rescue services finished their work at 6:30. On 25 May, a specialised company carried out non-destructive testing on the tanks to verify that there were no cracks.","The operator will examine which work procedures need to be implemented or changed (permit for crane work, working at heights, etc.). It plans to carry out the work on tanks filled up to the minimum level and to perform manual operations, if necessary.
While the rescue services were at work, the motor of one of the two seawater pumps supplying the fire fighters overheated after being used non-stop for 18 hours and due to blockage of some of the suction strainers. Despite a loss of efficiency, the water supply to the fire main remained sufficient. The freshwater pump was used as a backup. During the emptying phase, the walls of the retention troughs and the related compressed air networks broke under pressure from the water accumulated during the sprinkling of the tanks; when the bleed valves lost their air supply, they closed automatically and consequently the transfer of propane was stopped until the personnel could restore the network."

","On 19/07/00 an accident occurred during unloading operation of
liquid gas from a road-tanker into a pressure vessel in a tank deposit.
After the storage vessel was filled up to 85% and the filling operation
was interrupted by the overfill-protection system (acoustic alarm,
shutting of the quick-acting valve at the vessel), the driver of the
road tanker noticed that the safety-break coupling at the filling
device was leaking and that liquid gas was released.
Due to unknown causes, the ripcord activating the shut-off valves of
the road-tanker could not be activated anymore. This caused a release
in the environment of approximately 500 kg of liquid gas from the
road-tanker through the leakage source.
The investigation showed that constructive defects in the ""safety-break
coupling with predetermined breaking zone"" (DN 80, PN 25) caused the
occurrence.
- the M6 connection-screws of both coupling-halves were not secured.
There was neither an elastic ring, a cotter pin or a locknut installed.
-The screws were loose, this allowed the formation of a fissure between
both coupling-halves, which caused the liquid gas release.
- Screwheads and nuts did not lay-on flat but exceeded the curvature of
the bottleneck, such that there was not a smooth supporting surface.
",Gas lost value: approximately 350 Euro,"Closing off of the danger-area by the police and the fire brigade.

For reasons not yet clear, a considerable release of gas into the atmosphere occurred. A vapour cloud was  consequently generated, which invaded the plant. Being not able to stop the release, the man gave the alarm following the procedures, to the firemen, the national railway (whose tracks run close to the establishment) etc. After the arrival of the firemen, just when initiating their action, a first explosion took place, followed by a fire. The fire involved the two firemen teams, the truck-vessel driver and the employee who had given the alarm. The truck vessel was cracked in the above side (a hole of about 500 mm) with release of a big amount of propane and formation of a little fireball. The fire's heat-radiation caused the explosion of a nearby truck-vessel containing only few litres of LPG. A fragment of this vessel (1500 mm long) was found at a distance of 500 m, after it had provoked the crash down of the roof of a room close to a one-family house. Other fragments were spread around at minor distances. The fire, besides destroying the two motor-pumps of the fire-fighting team, affected 2 other truck vessels containing 12 and 35 m3 of propane and an empty truck vessel (12 m3) and 2 railway-vessels of propane (70 m3 capacity) waiting for unloading.The accident originated at 7.30 on 15 march 1996, when an employee of the company was transferring liquid propane from a truck-vessel (35 m3), standing there from the evening before, to the fixed storage installation. For causes not yet identified by the authority of Treviso, a big leak of propane occurred with the consequent formation of a flammable cloud about 1,5 m high. At 7.40, being impossible to stop the leakage, the employee gave the alarm by a multiple automatic device, foreseen by the emergency plan and calling directly the firemen of Treviso. About 10 minutes later, two motor vehicles of the firemen arrived into the establishment taking position between the office building and the bottling platform, where it was assumed that the propane cloud had arrived that moment. In such position the two motor-vehicles were at 35m from the truck-vessel which had caused the release. While starting the action to disperse the cloud, for not yet established causes, a first explosion occurred and a fire spread up to the truck-vessel, which was source of the release. The fire which involved all the vessels and truck-vessels standing nearby and only partially one of the 12 storage tanks forming the fixed installation, was put under control by the intervention of other fire brigades. at about 16.00 o'clock the same day. The population evacuation in a radius of 400 m from the establishment has been protracted, precautionally, up to the morning of the following day. As far as it concerns the crack formation (500 mm large) on the top of the tanker which had released, it should have occurred 10-15 minutes after the fire broke out, while the explosion of the half-empty tanker (12 m3) occurred at about 9 hrs). This last caused the complete destruction of the metallic vessel, which divided into fragments of various size; the fragment retrieved at greater distance from the origin is the same which demolished the roof of a room annexed to a private uni-familiar residence 500 m far from the establishment and sited in the residential area of the town causing only material damages.","Accidental release of propane, ignition and explosion of the vapour cloud due to not yet established causes. The Procura della Repubblica of Treviso is still investigating.After further investigation:Probable causes of the release could be the following: human error of the operator responsible for the vessel unloading or malfunction/rupture of the vessel unloading devices. The fire of the cloud formed after the release was ignited by a source which is still under investigation by the ""Procura della Repubblica"" of Treviso. Explosion of the12m3 half-empty vessel with scattering of fragments, initiated by the heat-radiation of the fire.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE: 1 employee of the company (company caretaker) involved in the explosion together with the firemen died some days after in the hospital from serious injuries and burns. 2 employees of the company received burns to face and hands and were recovered to the hospital. 10 firemen received&nbsp; more or less serious burns and and were hospitalized.MATERIAL DAMAGE: Partial collapse of the office-building of the establishment, break of aerial pipes connected to the fixed installations, damage to the bottling plant and unloading equipment. Damages to outside due to the spread of fragments of the partially empty exploded vessel. Other external damages (glass break etc.) to be assessed. The costs are actually not quantifiable. Anyway an estimate has to be given in order to determine the costs related to the external damages and to the persons affected.Disruption of community life: Interest of media at national level only for the day of the accident and the day after. Locally the interest is still live due to direct involvement.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","INTERNAL: Alarm given by the operator assigned to the unloading of the truck-vessel, which was source of accident.EXTERNAL: Actions by personnel of the establishment to stop the traffic on the road to the establishment. Telephone call to the nearby railway station in order to stop the trains in circulation (this was a superfluous action since no train was circulating at that time due to a national strike). Request of evacuation of nearby houses by external authorities in a radius of 400m around the establishment. The persons evacuated (up to the following morning) were about 250.Traffic interruption in the entrance road to the establishment and in the railway for the time necessary for the arrival of the emergency vehicles, the aid to the affected persons and for the accident duration. the accident affected mainly the internal side of the establishment (persons and materials); anyway consequences (only for materials) are present also externally due to the propagation of fragments hurled around by the explosion of the 12 m3 vessel.Official action taken - legal action: An official investigation by the Police authority of Treviso is actually in course, in order to establish the accident causes and responsibilities.","Immediate lessons: After the establishment construction in
1963, many residences have been built around it without considering the
risks. The consequences would have been more serious in case of BLEVE
or UVCE, involving also the external side of the establishment (as
foreseen in the safety report). Such circumstances should be avoided in
the future by applying the directives of the so called ""SEVESO II"" on
the land use planning in case of a plant with the risk of major
accidents.Measures to prevent recurrence: Realize in the future, in harmony with the ""SEVESO II"" directive and adequate planning policy of land use not allowing residential expansion near the high risk plants. Making more serious the obligations of the hazardous plants' operators in matter of safety and personnel training at every level of responsibility. In preparing emergency plans, internal or external, the consequences of any possible major accident should be taken into consideration independently from their more or less high probability obtained by the analysis of the safety report."

870,197,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Fire at a chemical facility,2015-08-04 17:15:00,2015-08-04 00:00:00,"At the time the fire broke out, on 4&nbsp;August&nbsp;2015 at around 17.15, the substance 2,2-dimethoxypropane (DMP) was being transferred from an intermediate bulk container (IBC) into 200-litre barrels. This manual transfer was being done using the force of gravity, with the liquid running from the IBC, which had been lifted using a forklift truck, via an attached funnel into the barrel. The transfer was taking place fairly centrally on the ground floor of the production building. On the explosion zone (ex-zone) plan, this point was marked as ‘ex-filling’.According to the work instruction, a barrel pump should be used and the IBC should be earthed. During transfer, the IBC, which had been lifted on a forklift truck, was positioned over the ‘ex-filling’ zone’s collecting basin. According to statements from experts and the property insurer, for reasons that are not completely clear, the flammable vapour/air mixture was ignited by an electrostatic discharge, resulting in a fire. When trying to remove the burning IBC from the production building, the forklift driver, in order to turn, initially drove with the IBC some 6&nbsp;m backwards into the synthesis area. There the fire became so fierce that the worker was not able to continue driving. He abandoned the forklift truck with the burning IBC and fled.This created a second fire source, which was not contained by a basin. The contents of the burning IBC, which was being progressively destroyed, was therefore able to feed a constantly expanding pool fire. Because of the production building’s nearby assembly opening, which created a stack effect, the fire was able to spread unhindered to the upper levels of the building. Within a very short period, therefore, the fire had spread from the mixing and separating area to the entire building.No one was injured during the fire. The production building, however, was a ‘total loss’, and its remains have since been demolished. The tank farm was not notably damaged.The total material damage amounted to approximately EUR&nbsp;22.3&nbsp;million.No material damage was found outside of the operating site. Both foam and water were used as extinguishing agents when fighting the fire. During the fire, members of the on-site fire service took measurements of harmful substances using sampling tubes. The results showed no increase in pollution.",Investigations by the property insurer found that the earth cable was not attached to the IBC and the barrel pump required by the work instruction was not used. The cause of the fire is thought to have been the ignition of the flammable vapour/air mixture by an electrostatic discharge.,The main building containing all production facilities as well as social and office spaces was completely destroyed (total loss).A neighbouring container storage facility was damaged.,Water cooling applied to the tank facility and the container storage facilities.,"The transfer activity must be described in more detail in the operation instructions or in a special work instruction. More detail should be provided on the following aspects:- the specified workflow (use of the barrel pump),- strict confinement of the transfer process to the transfer basin,- clear designation of the relevant potentially explosive zones,- use of suitable equipment in the zones,- use of suitable transport packaging (conductivity of the IBC),- ensuring that all fittings, work materials and equipment used during the transfer process are earthed. This includes the containers (barrels) to be filled and their peripheral equipment (funnels, ramps). The workers concerned should provide written confirmation that they have understood this. Structural fire protection:Following the incident, the main building can no longer be used, and it is currently being demolished. When planning the new building, the relevant regulations (above all the Industrial Buildings Directive [Industriebaurichtlinie — IndBauRL]) must be taken into account. Regardless of the resulting requirements that must be included in a structural fire protection plan, the experts recommend not only introducing fire protection means to separate the tank farm, the container storage facility and production facility from one another, but also separating the production facility into two fire compartments, as appropriate, to minimise the extent to which an initial fire can spread throughout the whole building.For the tank farm, which may still need to be used, the possibility of a secure sprinkler system must be provided, i.e. a second, independent water supply must be secured. Handling burning containers:Where a container is particularly hazardous, e.g. it is leaking or there is a (small) fire, arrangements must be made as to how it can be handled safely.In any event, it must be ensured that the burning container is not moved. Emergency drills:The operator should carry out emergency drills for ‘typical’ operational disruptions, such as leaks, overfilling or initial fires, in order to practice proper procedure. These drills should not be announced to operational staff."

Overheating of the conductor bridges at a relay station is very likely to have been the cause of the fire. The relay station serves the power supply (electrical current) of the sockets in a climate chamber. The overheating of the conductor bridges can lead to ignition of the plastic casing of the relay station and thus cause a fire.
Safety measures:As a result of the heat generated, the fire detection system was triggered and the site fire brigade was therefore alerted. When the site fire brigade arrived, there was a brief increase in pressure (deflagration of combustion gases) with a limited impact; a smoke and heat extraction window on the northern façade was pushed out.The site fire brigade extinguished the fire.","An overheating of the conductor bridges at a relay station is very likely to have been the cause of the fire.
In the laboratory room affected, there is a climate chamber with electrical equipment. Relay stations are located directly on the climate chamber.These relay stations enable the power supply of the sockets in the climate chamber to be switched on and off by means of buttons.The experts found that the traces of the fire indicate the area of the relay stations as the centre of the fire. It must therefore be assumed that the fire broke out in the vicinity of the relay stations due to a primary defect at a relay station.In the opinion of the experts, overheating of the conductor bridges of a relay station is very likely to have been the cause of the fire damage in the laboratory.","Fire damageCosts: EUR 9,000,000","Cordoning off of the research/laboratory building environment by the on-site fire brigade (within the area of operation).

Two employees were exposed to the gas, resulting in the death of one of them.
The chain of events leading to the accident started when an attempt was made to remove a precipitate adhered to a reactor vessel using mixed acid waste containing hydrogen fluoride and nitric acid. The reaction between the precipitate and mixed acid waste generated toxic gases that spread from the reactor vessel to the process facility through an open sampling connection. The employees were exposed to gas when they attempted to stop the dangerous reaction.","During the investigation, significant deficiencies were discovered in the assessment of and preparation for risks. It has been investigated that the following factors had a particular impact on the accident:

The hazards of mixed acid waste were not sufficiently understood in the company, and conflicting information about them was available.
Risks associated with the process had not been assessed sufficiently. The significance of risk control measures was not sufficiently understood, and they were not followed at the time of the accident.
No instructions or closely defined procedure were available for the removal of the precipitate.
The root causes of previous incidents taken place in the process had not been identified sufficiently.
The process did not include any measurements, alarms or other automatic protection measures that would have alerted employees of hazards or reduced the risk of human error.
The impact of the technical modifications made or the need to change working instructions had not been assessed.
The employees’ training, competence and protective equipment were insufficient to act in a serious (major) gas leak.
","Two employees were exposed to the gas, resulting in the death of one of them.","The two shift employees detected the gas leak and tried to stop the reaction by feeding neutralising lime into the vessel. One of the employees was soon found unconscious inside the hall close to the gas scrubber. Rescue services were called after the unconscious employee had been carried out of the facility. They delivered the exposed employees to emergency care and isolated the dangerous area. People living in the area were warned during the accident using an emergency population warning and vehicle speakers of the rescue department and the police.
Filling the vessel with water was selected as the protective measure, but a suitable coupling to connect the rescue vehicle to the plant’s pipeline was only found after some searching. Approximately 25 m3 of water was pumped into the tank. During the rescue operation, the generation of gas decreased and eventually stopped entirely.","
Waste handling companies must identify the hazardous properties and reactivity of waste chemicals in as much detail as possible based on the CLP regulation’s classification criteria. Classifications and labelling related to the transport of dangerous goods may not necessarily provide sufficient information about the hazardous properties of chemicals to the extent required by the chemical safety licence.
Producers and handlers of waste chemicals must ensure, through the exchange of information, that the hazardous properties and classifications are understood similarly in all parts of the waste chain.
Waste producers must ensure that handlers and recipients of waste are authorised to handle the waste chemicals in question, considering the environmental and safety permits issued (by the Regional State Administrative Agencies and Tukes). The hazardous properties and classifications of waste must be compared to the waste items permitted for handling and storage in the production plant’s licences and to the classifications of hazardous chemicals.
Operators that handle and store hazardous chemicals must address the volumes of chemicals generated by identified dangerous reactions or other incidents when defining the scope of operations in permit applications (ratio calculation).
Tukes (CA) must ensure that the volumes of chemicals generated as a result of any loss of process control and the impact of any accident have been assessed and presented in the permit applications of production plants. Hazardous chemicals generated during incidents may be significant in battery warehouses and other locations where electric batteries are kept, where any fire may generate significant volumes of toxic gases.

881,1076,Major Accident,Mining activities (tailings & physicochemical processes),Loss of containment  and oil spill in groundwater from an oil tank,2017-02-03 00:00:00,2017-03-02 00:00:00,"The event was verified on February 3, 2017, when a monitoring well located outside the perimeter of the plant was interested by the presence of water contaminated by hydrocarbons that flowed into a sewage pipeline to the consortium treatment plant. The discovery of the hydrocarbons in the monitoring well was possible thanks to the report of technicians of the&nbsp;consortium informing of the presence&nbsp;in the&nbsp; treatment plant of waters seemingly polluted by hydrocarbons. Further investigations (excavations inside the plant area and inspections of sewers outside it) led to the discovery of a widespread groundwater contamination combined with the presence of hydrocarbons at external sewers and consequently the assessing of the existence of an occurring uncontrolled emission of hydrocarbons involving subsoil and aquifer underlying the plant as well as a migration of contamination in areas outside its perimeter.The results of the surveys carried out on the tanks after their dismantling for the installation of the double hulls made it possible to ascertain that the event consisted in:
&nbsp;- loss of containment of one tank caused by corrosion of the bottom,
&nbsp;- product leakage in the layers underlying the bottom of the tank itself (foundation side) for the probable presence of cracks in the bituminous (flexible) sheath presumably due to the contact&nbsp;with the annular (rigid) concrete foundation.
This caused the vertical migration of crude oil from the unsaturated zone to the underlying saturated&nbsp; zone (freatic acquifer) at about 6 meters in depth. Subsequently, the presence below the oil tank of a preferential horizontal way of drainage of groundwater, consisting of the intubated and underground tract of a paleo-ditch, favored the drainage and rapid migration of the hydrocarbon plume into separate phase in the southwest direction and its extension outside the perimeter of the plant.","Analyzing the events that followed and which led to the leak of about 400 tons of crude oil and the contamination of more than 26,000 square meters of groundwater, the following can be assumed:
a) Failure of the primary protection system: damage to the bottom of the tank caused by a corrosive phenomenon that generated the formation of passing-through holes and the loss of containment of the tank.The surveys carried out on N. 3 tanks assessed that the loss of containment and consequent oil product emissions in the subsoil is to be attributed to some passing-through holes found at the bottom of only one tank caused by corrosion:• No. 1 hole through diameter of 20 mm,• No. 1 hole through diameter of 3 mm,• a truncated area (extending approximately 100x50 mm) affected by very high porosity including n. 7 passing-through holes with variable dimensions of 3 to 5 mm, and a last hole (near the entrance door) with a dimension of about 10 mm. Investigations on the other 2 tanks&nbsp; excluded the presence of passing-through holes. The 4th tank was already equipped with a double bottom since 2013. It is not plausible the involving of sewage networks and drainage as a cause of contamination, because following surveys carried out by the operator had not reported damage in the waste water sewerage system.b) Failure of the secondary protection system: damage to the asphalt sheath resulting in cracking.The causes that favored vertical migration into the underlying layers of the tank bottom are due to the probable damage to the waterproof layer consisting of a bituminous conglomerate for a thickness of about 80 mm&nbsp;below this. Non-destructive investigations carried out with the georadar probe during the installation of double bottoms on the tank led the operator to exclude&nbsp;voids below the foundation, although it should be considered that this instrumentation does not allow to identify cracks in the sizeof the order of mm. It is very likely that such cracks&nbsp;had been generated by&nbsp; the contact&nbsp; of two materials with different behavior at stresses (bituminous layer with less rigid behavior in contact&nbsp;with&nbsp;rigid concrete foundation).Probably the bituminous conglomerate of low strength, subjected to the continuous vertical pressures of the product at the bottom of the tank (variable depending on the degree of filling) tends to deform and break at the contact with the&nbsp; harder concrete foundation, causing detachment of the asphalt layer.c) Failure of alarm systems to prevent and / or mitigate the event and to signal the&nbsp;uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons.The containment losses of primary and secondary protection systems allowed the vertical migration of crude oil into the underlying layers of bituminous conglomerate consisting of honeycomb and compacted hollow mix of thickness of 1 meter and 2 meters respectively.The vertical migration of the crude oil proceeds from the unsaturated zone to the saturated one&nbsp; (aquifer) until it reaches the groundwater table at about 5-6 meters in depth. Subsequently, the presence below the tank of a preferential horizontal drainage pathway of groundwater, consisting of the presence of an intubated and underground tract of a paleo-ditch favored the drainage and rapid migration of the hydrocarbon plume into separate phase in the southwest direction.The event was verified on 3 February 2017 when the extent of contamination had already reached the areas outside of the plant.","The loss of containment of about 400 tons of crude oil caused as a result the formation of LNAPL product on the groundwater table and their contamination for an extension of about 26,000 square meters. Contamination is intended as&nbsp;an overrun of the standards in force in the field of quality / protection / groundwater reclamation. At present it is not possible to determine the volume of saturated / unsaturated soil affected by contamination.","On site and off site
After being noticed on 3 February 2017 of the presence of Hydrocarbons in the sewage, the operator undertook the following actions:

-&nbsp;notifications to the authorities required by the IPPC and Seveso (External Emergency Plan) regulations;
- identification of&nbsp;the route of the piping connected to the sewage well outside the establishment, and&nbsp;of the nature and origin of the contaminant;
- interception downstream of the sewage system by inflatable septum;&nbsp;
- excavation of a trench&nbsp;on the internal side of the establishment in order to intercept any contaminated flow;
- installation of&nbsp;piezometers in order to better define the conceptual model and possible contamination and its distribution;
- analysis of sub soil and water taken during investigations;
- under&nbsp;control of the competent authorities,&nbsp; starting of&nbsp;the remediation of the polluted soil, subsoil and groundwater.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Subsequently the operator provided for the following corrective actions:

- update of the evaluation of risk associated with the tank oil spill;
- double bottom installation on the crude oil storage tanks;
- implementation of an Extraordinary Maintenance Plan;
- update of the tank storage operational control procedure;
-&nbsp;integrity check of buried pipelines;
- update/issue of concerned&nbsp;HSE IMS procedures taking into account the event occurred:

-periodic inspections on sewage networks
-identification of critical elements/equipment for the environment
-safety procedures operational control
-environmental operational control
-management of accidents, injuries, near miss, medical treatments, first aid cases and unsafe acts/conditions
-management of the&nbsp;operational emergency safety measures.
-operative control procedure for emergency safety barriers and piezometers
-implementation of surface water monitoring procedure for external areas outside the establishment
-implementation of the management scheme for the management of oil spills with external impact



&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;","The causes of the accident are mainly due to weaknesses in risk assessment in relation to:
• shortcomings in the assessment of risks in terms of consequences;
• deficiencies in the control of the corrosion phenomenon, in the application of the results of the operational experience and in the revaluation of tanks maintenance frequencies;
• shortcomings in the adoption of ""compensatory"" preventive / protection measures in the waves of completion of the works for the realization of double funds.
In practice, the technical/management safety measures adopted by the operator such as:• Passive tank protection systems (sacrificial anode) combined with day-to-day control of basin integrity and possible loss from tank trunking;• control of water content below the 0.2% threshold;• Moving the bottom of the tanks through agitators to avoid both the separation of water from the oil and the consequent increase in the corrosive processes of the bottom due to the aggressiveness of the water;• the use of corrosion inhibitors;• Immediate action in the emergency responce,were considered sufficient by the operator to ensure the integrity of the tanks during the foreseen maintenance period (10 years) and to estimate that the risk of environmental consequences stemming from these events was still limited and that the potential impact could affect a limited portion of surface, even in the worst conditions.

However, as early as 2013, after 5 years after the first extraordinary maintenance, there was a loss of containment from 2 tanks. This led the operator to adopt as a definitive protective measure the creation of the double bottom of the first&nbsp; tank and the repair of the trunk of the second one.These events should have led the operator to prevent uncontrolled crude oil releases, to re-evaluate the reliability of its tanks and to adjust maintenance frequencies in relation to its operational experience, that is to say, in view of the the predictions of the state of degradation of tank bottoms.
The analysis produced by the operator for the purpose of assessing the consequences of a possible loss of containment and therefore in terms of vertical and horizontal migration speeds of contamination have not been reflected in reality due to the presence of the intubated tract of a buried stream passing accross the plant. Such a channel, the existence of which was not known, constituted a real preferred drainage pathway, with very high hydraulic conductivity in relation to the context, which was necessary for mapping and which would have to be taken into account in calculating the magnitude of the consequences ( horizontal migration speed and extension of contamination).
During the implementation of the mandatory maintenance plan (requested by Authority in 2013) aimed to improve the tank protection equipment (double fund installation), the operator should have promptly implemented&nbsp; at least technical prevention/protection measures of a ""compensatory"" type, or preventing/monitoring leakage of product from the bottom of the tanks without double bottom and/or mitigate the consequences of such losses (also in the light of the events occurring on other 2 two tank in 2013).

The filling operation was started in the charging room at 07:00. The filling operation was proceeding smoothly without the operators observing anything unusual (an operator inspected the front of the racks at 09:00 and everything was normal). No particular action by the operators were taken immediately prior to the explosions. The first explosion occurred at 09:10 and the second 10-15 seconds later. Soon after, an operator switched off the electric supply system at the main switch. Part of the roof blew off, windows were blown out and part of the wall between the charging room and the electrical room collapsed. Fires broke out and further explosions occurred. 11 cylinders were either completely ruptured or partially opened. Deflagration or detonation occurred in the piping system and likely in the cylinders. Acetylene was released from the gasholder. This release was either due to continued gas production after the compressors were stopped or acetylene back flow from the high-pressure system where valves were leaking after their seats had melted. The local fire brigade was mobilized (32 firefighters involved) from Holbaek in extinguishing the fire. Cooling by means of water was continued for 24 hours before all the valves could be closed. Cylinders which have been exposed to fire were emptied outdoors.",CAUSES:The initiating event may have been either a leaking high-pressure hose or a decomposition of acetylene causing pipe rupture and therefore an explosive gas release into the charging room. The underlying causes that led to a leakage from a high-pressure hose were an insufficient component design and an inadequate maintenance program.,"EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 1 person was injured (and hospitalized but for observation for shock only) by the explosion.MATERIAL LOSS:The explosions and the following fires damaged the building, the cylinders filling equipment and the pressure cylinders. The cost of the damages has been evaluated in about 3.6 millions DKR (about 0.5 MECU).Outside the establishment a few windows were broken by the explosions but no data are available about their cost.Material loss - Establishment losses - material max euro: 480000Material loss - Establishment losses - material max local: 3600000Material loss - Local currency: DKRAffected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Cooling by means of water was continued for 24 hours before all the valves could be closed.

884,413,Major Accident,"Production, destruction and storage of explosives",Explosion in a propellent factory,2002-05-28 11:19:00,2002-05-28 00:00:00,"An explosion took place in a building where double base propellant was produced.&nbsp; One propellant roll exploded when it was pressed through a matrix. There was one fatality.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A batch of six propellant rolls were brought into the thermostatic cabin of the pressing room.&nbsp; Four of these six rolls were pressed prior to&nbsp; the accident.&nbsp; The press had been functioning normally. The operator depressed&nbsp; the ""OK"" button for the fifth pressing. The green light was lit up on the control desk downstairs indicating that the press process could be started. Almost immediately after the start button had been pressed an explosion occurred. The estimated time of explosion and the nature of it&nbsp; are based on the information from the operators who were downstairs at the time of the accident. According to them&nbsp; an unidentified sound was heard from upstairs immediately following the start of the press. The explosion occurred immediately after this sound. The operator of the press being present&nbsp; in the pressing room when the explosion occurred, was killed. The three operators and the foreman downstairs ran out of the building. They were not injured.The operator who died had had more than 20 years of experience&nbsp; at the double base propellant process.","The investigation&nbsp; group could not identify with certainty the technical cause of the accident. However, the most likely course of events was judged to be the following: 1. After the start-up&nbsp; the hydraulic equipment commenced functioning normally, according to the control system. 2. Due to the failure of the gasket of the lifting cylinder, the heavy piston was able to move fairly freely3. The air pressure in the pressing cylinder increased to several bars causing a rise of the temperature higher than self ignition temperature of the propellant.&nbsp; Because of the fast lowering of the piston the&nbsp; suction pump&nbsp; was not able to develop a vacuum quickly enough.&nbsp; 4. As a result of the fast rising temperature in the pressing cylinder the propellant probably self-ignited. 5. After the pressure had reached high enough (to the range above 5 kbars) the burning of the propellant&nbsp; transformed into a detonation. 6. The piston lifted very quickly due to the high pressure of the explosion and then returned&nbsp; downwards again at a very high speed caused by the gas pressure. At this point the seal of the lifting cylinder was totally destroyed. The lower part of the lifting cylinder expanded. ","The operator of the press was in the pressing room when explosion occurred and he was killed in the accident. The three operators and the foreman downstairs ran out of the building. They were not injured. The cylinder and the surrounding iron cast heating jacket were partly fragmented. The major part of the fragments were stopped by the structural walls and earth wall surrounding the building. A few bigger fragments flew over the surrounding earth wall up to 200 meters. These fragments caused no damage to persons or material. The outer walls of the pressing room (light construction) and the roof were destroyed. The supporting structures were damaged. The floor of the building was slightly cracked. The downstairs windows were broken and fell outside the building. None of the windows of the other buildings were damaged. The explosion caused a fire in the pressing room. The fire spread to the vegetation on the earth wall. Part of the exterior roof of the pressing room was destroyed in the fire, which was quickly extinguished. ","Fire brigade was alarmed and it managed to extinguish the remaining fire in a short time. Discussion about response: The company has started a three year program mainly based on the accident investigation. The aim is to further develop the safety system, safety culture and to make sure that the improvement suggestions of the accident investigation group will be carried out. ",Measures to prevent recurrence: After the&nbsp; accident the following preventive actions were established: - Horizontal press would eliminates the free fall of the piston- It must be ensured that no personnel are in the hazardous working areas.- Risk analysis systems should reveal hidden design errors.- The possibility of adiabatic pressing has to be eliminated. It is necessary to further develop the safety system and&nbsp; safety culture of the company. Measures to mitigate consequences: Design principles of the safety walls against fragments have to be checked.

Due to this reason a DN25-pipeline was switched from the manual draining valve 1 to the manual draining valve 2 of the column sump discharge pipeline, with the objective to drain the water from the evaporator in direction of the column located downstream to the evaporator.Due to the fact that there was no circulation (the pipeline kept cold), a blind cover was opened, to allow water drainage in the open (catch cup). The operation was performed during the afternoon and the evening respectively by two operators, one of which would open the blind cover, observe the water flow released and then close the blind cover again, while the other operator would open the manual valve and close it again as soon the released water flow would stop.The event occurred during the water drainage procedure at 23:30 (the onsite fire brigade was alerted at 23:36), when the manual valve could not be closed again completely.Following to that propylene gas was released through the discharge nozzle. The blind cover could not be closed again due to the high pressure in the column and resulted in a large quantity of propylene gas released.","A trial run was performed on a new column with evaporator etc. (before starting service).Propylene pressure was of approx.&nbsp; 22 Bar, sump temperature of approx. 60 °C. The product flow rate approx. 40% of the service flow.The event was caused by a defective manual valve, mounted on the water drainage pipeline of the newly built gas purification column in the isopropyl alcohol plant (IPA-synthesis). The manual valve was opened during trial operation of the plant. After several actuations, welding particles were flushed out from the system and deposited on the valve seat. A tight closure of the valve was not any more possible and propylene was released after the water. Despite the immediate shut-down of the plant pressure equalisation took a relatively long time.","Loss of propylene, extinguishing water","Emergency response measures by the plant staff and the on-site fire brigade.Within the first hour the on-site emergency response service established contact with the fire department (a part from the phone calls a notification was sent by fax), and with the emergency service of the competent environmental agency (by telephone).Due to the fact that the gas-cloud was limited to a radius of 50m around the column by means of water curtains, and that outside of the water curtains there was no gas detectable, there was no need of intervention of external emergency response services.

The pipe connects two process vessels that are under negative pressure in normal process conditions. The level indicator was installed in the gas phase of the pipe.
In the initial planning of the shutdown, the installation was to be emptied. The permit-to-work for the removal of the level indicator was made up based on the assumption that the gas line and the connected vessels would be empty but not flushed and cleaned. &nbsp;
It was the only maintenance work to be done on this gas line. &nbsp;Due to time pressure, the need to empty the gas line was reassessed. It was decided that the removal of the sensor could be done without emptying the line and connected vessels based on the facts that the sensor was mounted in the gas phase and the connected vessels under vacuum. The permit-to-work was not adapted to this new condition.
The level sensor was labelled the day preceding the work. However, the operator did not tag the level sensor but a temperature measuring device in a liquid line just beneath the gas line, also connecting the two process vessels. &nbsp;
The contractor removed all bolts of the flange without any sign of leakage due to the under pressure. When the flange connection was broken, air was sucked in, the content of the two vessels and the pipe line released and could not be stopped. In total about 12 tonnes of a mixture of nitrobenzene and dinitrobenzene was released to the work floor.&nbsp;","Line breaking on a wrong and not emptied pipeline connected to two process vessels, due to an error in labelling of the sensor that had to be removed for inspection.&nbsp;
The investigation showed that although required by the company’s permit-to-work system that there was no control of the installation and safety measures before permit authorisation. Also, since the installation was to be empty but not flushed, the first line breaking was supposed to be supervised by an operator, but wasn't. These are two missed opportunities to detect the wrong labelling of the sensor.
The underlying cause was a to high workload on permits-to-work during shutdown.&nbsp; &nbsp;
Another underlying cause was that the prepared work permit was not changed after the descision not to empty the installation.","In total about 12 tonnes of a mixture of nitrobenzene and dinitrobenzene was released to the work floor.&nbsp;
The spill was contained by the company&rsquo;s emergency team.&nbsp; No one was injured. The contractor was luckily fully protected (Hazmat suit and breathing protection).

The inlet valve for liquid ammonia to the sphere was closed, but ammonia was still passing through. High level alarms (High and High-High) came in, but the operators believed that the alarms were false since the sphere was closed out. This resulted in the sphere filling up completely and subsequently, liquid ammonia entered the ammonia gas system. This caused 4 episodes of ammonia releases during the period 10.07.2020 17:30 to 11.07.2020 09:30. 2 of these releases ocured relatively close to areas where people and vehicles may be present.","Direct causes: The valve that was used to close the ammonia feed to the sphere was passing ammonia in spite of being in a closed position, and several alarms on high level where not reacted to because the operator believed the alarms to be false.
Contributing factors:

- Lack of understanding of the instrumentation system – that the level alarms where independent from the level indication.
- Insufficient communication
-Insufficient labeling of passing valves
-Missing risk assessment for the method used to close out the ammonia sphere&nbsp;

London Fire Brigade attended at 03:30 and eventually 70 Fire-fighters and 16 pumps were involved in tackling the blaze, bringing it under control by 06:50. Damping-down operations continued until 18:30, when the Fire Brigade handed control of the site back to Brenntag. The establishment was un-attended at the time of the fire and over the preceding weekend, so there were no injuries amongst staff. Although the fire caused a smoke plume visible across east London, there have been no reports of any adverse health impact to public or emergency services staff. Firewater was contained on-site using tertiary containment areas and later discharged to foul sewer under agreement with the sewage undertaker. There was high media interest in the fire, particularly because of the site’s emergency siren which was activated by the fire and was audible across the local area. Operators initial assessment is that about 75% of the inventory of the dry-goods warehouse was lost, either to fire or in the fire-water: using this estimate about 36 tonnes of R50 Dangerous to the Environment and 34 tonnes of Oxidisers were lost, making the incident reportable to Europe. Many of the substances involved are chlorine or bromine based and some are dual classified as both Oxidisers and R50 - Very Toxic to aquatic organisms. As the Top Tier COMAH threshold for both classifications is 200 tonnes the relevant quantity for reporting to the EU under Schedule 7 is 10 tonnes (5%).","Due to the damage caused by the fire it was difficult to determine the precise cause of the fire, but it probably started by decomposition of Calcium Hypochlorite either because of contamination during manufacture and /or during packing on site. The other possibility is the self decomposition during a hot weather event which was contributed to by inadequate ventilation. In addition the pack and over packe design did not facilitate dissipation of heat from the packs of product.","The primary consequence was disruption to the site operations, which closed for at least one day and the warehouse had to be refurbished and only returning to operational use&nbsp;in April 2013. There were no injuries or reported ill health effects from this incident, although&nbsp;a large amount of smoke was generated that drifted off site. Fire water was contained on site and disposed of safely.","There were no offsite impacts as all fire water was retained and then release to the foul water system with pernission of the water authority.

A poorly-controlled pressure rise caused significant damage to the installation. The amount of damage is sufficient to make this accident notifiable under the Seveso II Directive.
 
The accident is classified on level 3 of the severity scale on the basis of the criteria ""material damages within the establishment"" (30 MF or 4.6 MEuros). 
","The malfunctioning of the column was primarily due to the inappropriate presence of water, which reacted with the di-isocyanate. A subsequent inspection revealed that one of the two boilers at the bottom of the column was leaking where a tube had been cold-joined to its support plate. In addition, during the accident, the operators experienced difficulties in controlling the variations of pressure and temperature on the right hand side of the column. In particular, the column had been re-supplied with at about 13.00, when it had been barely stabilised. The 3 downstream units which use Isocyanate Toluene are supplied with the product almost in line, and therefore require rapid start-up of Isocyanate Toluene purification.","The damage (column plates deformed and out of use) has been estimated at 30 MF (4.6 Meuro), and the loss of production at 0.5 MF/day. Three downstream establishments using Isocyanate Toluene have also had to reduce their activities.",The opening of valves to remove the residues (ammonia...) involved the temporary evacuation of the personnel present in the unit. External fire fighters were called in to reduce the temperature of the installation. The fire-fighters hosed down the column until 7.15a.m. the following day.,"After the accident several measures have been taken:·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; training of operators has been increased;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the unit has been modified: inclusion of a pressure probe, proper instrumentation on the steam valves, measurements and alarms on temperature and pressure;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; procedures have been modified: reinforcement of the use of checklists and their follow-up by the various teams, traceable documentation of vacuum tests on the boilers.

The gas capacity sensor was incorrectly calibrated for the status ‘gas holder full’. While the capacity displayed was at 83&nbsp;%, the actual capacity was already at 100&nbsp;%. The safety chain, which would have switched off the compressor at 90&nbsp;% capacity and activated the automatic gas flare at 95&nbsp;% capacity, could not therefore be triggered.
The mechanical overpressure / negative pressure protection system did not discharge the specified 400&nbsp;Nm3/hr, despite high pressure.
The additional electrical gas overpressure and negative pressure sensors were not connected on the gas side, nor were they wired up correctly, and also failed to trigger the safety chain. Before it entered into operation, the facility was partially accepted by an expert within the meaning of Section&nbsp;29a of the Federal Emission Protection Act (BImSchG). The inspection report required the operator to rectify certain deficiencies prior to commencing operation and to confirm this in writing to the expert. In particular, the measuring devices had to be calibrated and verified. Once this work had been carried out, the expert had no concerns as regards safe operation.

Calibrating the gas capacity sensors required completely raising the membrane of the container. As this could not be achieved while the expert was present, the correct adjustment had to be confirmed by a specialist firm. Once calibration was complete, it could be assumed that the capacity indication was correct.The functioning of the mechanical overpressure / negative pressure protection system was also tested, confirmed and documented by the expert. The electrical gas overpressure and negative pressure sensors were successfully tested to ensure they functioned properly, and this was documented.At some point after the expert’s acceptance testing, the electrical sensors’ connections were altered such that they no longer functioned. The calibration of the gas capacity sensors required by the expert was not arranged for by the operator. Furthermore, the exhaust pipe on the overpressure / negative pressure protection system was fitted with a rain cover, the suitability of which is not documented (this was not there at the time of acceptance testing). It cannot be conclusively established whether or not this cover resulted in a safety-relevant impairment to the exhaust pipe, which meant that the required pressure release capability was no longer available. Safety devices incorrectly installed, sensors incorrectly calibrated and low performance of overpressure / negative pressure protection system.",Foil roof and biogas membrane torn/destroyed.,"Gas-side separation (isolation) of the digestate storage tank.
Repair, once the cause had been established and approval had been granted by the expert.","- Both membranes of the air-supported roof replaced;- Gas overpressure / negative pressure sensors connected properly, and safety chain set correctly;- Second overpressure / negative pressure protection system installed, with a capacity of 600&nbsp;Nm3/hr of biogas;- Renewed safety inspection of the digestate storage tank. The lessons learned from this accident are as follows:- Acceptance testing by an expert represents a snapshot of the prevailing condition of the facility at the time of testing. If changes are made to the facility, in particular to safety-related equipment, conditions for safe operation can no longer be assumed in principle.- The investigation revealed that the facility was put into operation without the deficiencies, in particular the capacity monitoring, having been rectified as required by the expert. The competent authority was only belatedly made aware of this situation. The inspection report was not promptly forwarded to the authority. It is therefore advisable to establish enforceable written standards for acceptance testing by an expert in accordance with Section&nbsp;29a, as well as for follow-up inspections, deadlines and forwarding inspection results to the authorities. These standards should support and facilitate monitoring.- Biogas facility operators often rely on assistance from contractors, as they themselves do not have the requisite skills. A strong emphasis must be placed on the credentials of outside companies. It is important to document the work done and to hand over the documentation once work is complete, so that each operator is aware of potential errors and the necessary follow-up measures, including inspections."

Five workers were killed and a further 18 seriously affected. Two workers were on the top of a tanker containing HF. They were preparing to connect a flexible air hose to a valve on the tanker top in order to offload it to the plant by pressurisation. While they were working with connections on the tanker,about 8 tonnes of HF erupted at high pressure from the tanker and rapidly spread to the surrounding atmosphere. The two workers were engulfed in the fumes, thrown from the top of the tanker and killed. Two other workers repairing a pump at ground level near the tanker were also killed as was an employee in a nearby office. Another eighteen workers were injured or affected by HF fumes. There were large- scale effects on the surrounding area, with at least 3000 members of the public reporting symptoms associated with inhaling the fumes, and widespread damage to crops and livestock. Six hundred local residents, within 300 metres of the incident, were evacuated from their homes and 700 workers in the area were provided with respiratory protection masks.","The possibility that the two operators on the tanker top thought that the tanker was empty not full was mooted. There is no evidence of this, but why a full tanker might have been about to be offloaded in a plant that actually produced HF, is not clear.","About 8 tonnes of HF erupted at high pressure from the tanker and rapidly spread to the surrounding atmosphere. The two workers were engulfed in the fumes, thrown from the top of the tanker and killed. Two other workers repairing a pump at ground level near the tanker were also killed as was an employee in a nearby office. Another eighteen workers were injured or affected by HF fumes. The cloud of HF spread over a large part of the rest of the industrial site and caused many firms to shut down. It then spread to the surrounding area, affecting about 500 acres of farmland and some 3000 livestock. The local population also suffered significant distress, with at least 3000 people being treated for symptoms including nausea, vomiting, chest pains, rashes and sore eyes or throats due to inhalation of the fumes. The overall cost of the damage has been estimated at between $15.9 - $20M (&pound;9.9 &ndash; 12.5M). The acid corroded over 1100 vehicles. On 08 October, 2012 the South Korean government declared Gumi and the surrounding area to be a &ldquo;special disaster area&rdquo; thus making residents eligible for financial compensation and aid to recover losses.","Municipal firefighters arrived without knowing the exact nature of the accident and without adequate protection (mask and acid suit). They water the leak with water, thus worsening the product release. Called in firefighters from the nearest American military base shall ensure themselves the closure of the circulation around the plant to prevent residents and cars circulate through the toxic cloud that formed. They alert the local police to continue this work and is responsible for the evacuation of the population within 1.5 km. The slow response of the authorities has been criticized, the 300 residents directly affected being evacuated until 10 days after the accident, as well as insufficient resources available to the emergency, including the lack of neutralizing agents (lime) during the first 22 intervention hours. Within 20 km, declared ""disaster area"" land must be cleared in the following weeks, as well as buildings. Riparian evacuees will be an epidemiological study. The first evidence gathered by the police records from a surveillance camera of the transfer station and review of the tanker crashed in particular, show that two employees are mounted on the tank to connect the air hose designed to drive acid in the tank from the tank; one branch air hose, while the second to save time begins to loosen the bolts on the valve buffer output of acid. The latter then accidentally struck the arm of the manual outlet valve, which opens partially allowing the HF pressure to spring. In road transport, internal pressure would have formed by thermal expansion of the product.","Unveiling closed-circuit footage, police said that the workers who died in the accident were presumed to have not been abiding by safety regulations nor wearing protective working clothes.An increases attention to the work safety procedures by the management and an adequate information training of the workers could have result in a reduction of the risk and outcome."

Failure of 10&nbsp;kV power supply;
At the same time, the fire detection system is activated in the distribution station and the public fire brigade is automatically alerted;
In the LNG control room, the error message ‘boil-off fan failure’ is displayed;
The emergency power supply for the boil-off fans comes into operation;
Repeated attempts to start the boil-off fans are unsuccessful;
The supply of steam and control air is interrupted.

Safety measures:

For the control air supply, the replacement supply using nitrogen was put into operation.
In the boil-off line, the damper was opened to the open air, meaning that the heated boil-off gas could be released in a controlled manner into the open air via an outlet in the compressor building, thus preventing the safety valves on the accumulator roof from being tripped and allowing cold methane (heavy gas properties) to escape - the surrounding area was checked with gas detectors (boil-off volume approx. 500&nbsp;m³/h).
","Cause of failure of 10&nbsp;kV power supply:A rodent in the switch panel caused a short circuit.The short-lived arc triggered an automatic fire alarm, which in turn set off the factory alarm.
Cause of failure of boil-off fans:Due to a wiring error during earlier modifications to the control system, the control system in emergency power mode did not receive any feedback that the fan had started. This led the fan to start up briefly before shutting down.
Technical fault in boil-off fans in emergency power mode.",No consequence,The surrounding area was checked with gas detectors.Professional fire brigade attended in response to the automatic fire alarm. Their access to the site was delayed by the works gate not being connected to the emergency power supply.,"
Restore the correct wiring of the fan control in emergency power mode.
Functional tests of the fan in emergency power mode.
Protecting the switch panel from rodents.
Connection of the works gate to the emergency power supply.

Competent authority's response:The failure was caused by a short circuit in the switch panel of a distribution station, which was caused by the ingress of a rodent (dormouse). Despite the fact that the amount of gas released was low and that there was no risk to the public, the lessons learned from this are important for plant safety.

Intrusion by rodents must be avoided or prevented.In general, potential malfunctions caused by animals, e.g. insects, birds, rodents, etc., should be investigated and taken into account in plant operations, e.g. regular checks for animal nests, gnawed components such as cables, rodent droppings in ‘closed spaces’, etc.
Emergency services must be able to access the site at all times.&nbsp;As a result of the power failure, the power-operated gate lost power and had to be opened manually using cranks. Future connection to the emergency power will ensure that the gate can be opened quickly.
Where provision is made to switch over to the emergency power system, this must be checked and, as far as possible, tested in order to ensure full operation.A missing signal cable meant that the boil-off fan could not be activated and the gas could not be transferred to the low-pressure storage tank. As a result, the discharge dampers had to be opened in order to avoid dangerous overpressure.
If the emergency power system had been working properly, there would have been no release of gas despite the power failure.
As the error was caused by a modification in the control room, this event highlights the importance of effective change management for the safety of the plant. Change management must also include appropriate checks and test procedures.

These findings are not only applicable to gas plants or LNG storage facilities. The points listed are of general importance for plant safety and can be applied appropriately on a case-by-case basis.

At the end of the night-shift one of the main furnaces at the plant exploded - killing two operators and causing a total damage of the production plant. Another operator was seriously injured and&nbsp;two other operators had minor physical injuries. The plants office building was destroyed by a fire following the explosion.&nbsp;
The explosion occurred during re-melting of aluminum scrap. This is a 17 - hour batch operation, and is considered as a normal melting oven operation.&nbsp;The operators worked in the production hall and had finalized the charging of the oven just a few minutes before the explosion. Everything seemed to be normal. The operators had noticed minor disturbances in the oven (two times a bang) prior to the explosion, but this&nbsp;was not unusual and no interventions were made.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A violent explosion occurred, and the melting oven was completely destroyed and melted metal, half-melted metal, warm bricks, concrete, steel and other construction materials were thrown in all directions. The entire production facility collapsed.","The health and safety authorities performed an inspection of the enterprise in order to clarify the course of events and the causes. The inspection report point out&nbsp; deviations from the regulations related to insufficient plant risk assessment and scrap receiving procedures.
It has not been possible to reconstruct the course of events in detail, because the process log was lost in the fire. The inquiry concluded that the explosion most probably was caused by entrapped water in the scrap feed into the furnace containing melted aluminum. The conclusion is well supported by observations and assessments, but not evident. As a part of the technical-operational inquiry, Gexcon has performed a report outlining the possible courses of events. Incidentally, the conclusion correspond with the fact that most aluminum casthouse explosions with severe consequences are caused by water vapor explosions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",2&nbsp;operators were killed and&nbsp;three injured. The plant was totally damaged. No injuries or damage outside the plant.,"The police, local firebrigade, ambulance service, Civil defense and Rescue helicopter were part of the emergency response. The firebrigade extinguished the fires and used smoke-divers in the search&nbsp;for people.","The risk of explosions when you have&nbsp;entrapped water in the scrap is well known from literature and experiences from accidents. This top event is not sufficiently dealt with in the companies risk assessment, and therefore not reflected in their internal procedures or focused&nbsp;in the daily operation of the plant. Since it was regarded as normal to have minur disturbances when charging, it seems that there was an acceptance to feed&nbsp;moist scrap metal to the furnace.&nbsp;"

The fire rapidly spread to the rest of the transfer station, resulting in the violent rupture of numerous 205 litre drums and small aerosols. There were no on-site casualties. Some off-site ill-health symptoms have been reported, but there is currently no conclusive evidence of long-term impairment of the health of any members of the public.The incident was compounded by serious flooding in the area causing the site to be cut-off four days after the incident, and accessible only by boat. The majority of the site itself was flooded to varying depths.The incident is reportable as it meets the following criteria:a) COMAH schedule 7, Part 1, para 1(a) - a fire involving a quantity of at least 5% of the qualifying quantity (for top-tier application of very toxics), andb) COMAH schedule 7, Part 1, para 1(b)(v) - evacuation of persons/time being greater then 500 hours. On the day, 60 people were evacuated for 12 hours. Further evacuations occurred the next week due to concern about possible on-going side effects.Type of accident - Remarks: A fire occurred at approximately 02.00 on Monday 30 October 2000 in a waste storage area at Cleansing Service Group Ltd (CSG), Upper Parting Works, Sandhurst, Gloucester. The site is a licensed waste treatment facility and transfer station for a wide range of hazardous waste chemical substances and is notified as a Control of Major Accident Hazard Regulations 1999 (COMAH) Lower Tier site. The fire originated in compound 1 of the waste transfer station in the southwest of the site which was unoccupied at the time, rapidly spreading to other areas of the site.

The incident occurred at a time of severe storms with gale force winds and very heavy rain. Wind speeds peaked at 50 - 60 mph. These extreme weather conditions continued to cause problems throughout the day.

The Fire Service accessed the site via the fields to the south, due to the very strong prevailing wind from the south. Throughout the day, water and foam were applied to the fire which was concentrated at the south end of the site. The fire was eventually fully extinguished by 18.00 on the 30 October, having burned for approximately 16 hours, although a number of drums involved in the fire continued to smoulder. The fire was restricted to the waste transfer area and did not affect the bulk tank storage on site. Most of the firewater was retained on site, by site containment measures, but some contaminated water escaped and had to be pumped back.&nbsp;Meteorological conditions - Remarks: Details above from Met Office via Gloucester Fire Service.
Severe weather warning issued by the Met Office at 04:07 Monday 30th October 2000 (affecting Gloucestershire): severe south westerly gales with damaging gusts to around 80mph and outbreaks of heavy rain will gradually clear eastwards during the morning. The strong winds are significant as this is the possible cause of drum falling and initiating the incident. Also significant in spread and severity of fire.Precipitation: rain; Wind speed: 216.00; Wind direction: SSW; Wind stability: D; Temperature: 12.00
Chronology of incident:- On Monday 30 October 2000 at approximately 02.00, a fire occurred in compound 1 of the waste transfer station in the southwest of the site (unoccupied at the time).- First call to the emergency services was logged at 02.19 and the Fire Service arrived on the scene within 6 minutes.- Agency staff attended immediately. HSE and other parties, including Gloucestershire Health Authority (GHA), also attended during the incident.- The Fire Service was unable to approach the site for some hours because of the intensity of the fire and small aerosol cans exploding.- The incident occurred at a time of severe storms with gale force winds and very heavy rain. Wind speeds peaked at 50 - 60 mph. These extreme weather conditions continued to cause problems throughout the day.- The Fire Service set-up a forward command post in the car park of the Globe public house, located on Sandhurst Lane approximately 1km south of the site. At approximately 10.40, this site was evacuated due to the expected flooding of Sandhurst Lane. The command post was re-established at the southern end of the lane, approximately 2 km from the site.- The Fire Service accessed the site via the fields to the south, due to the very strong prevailing wind from the south. Throughout the day, water and foam were applied to the fire which was concentrated at the south end of the site.- The fire was eventually fully extinguished by 18.00 on the 30 October, having burned for approximately 16 hours, although a number of drums involved in the fire continued to smoulder.- The fire was restricted to the waste transfer area and did not affect the bulk tank storage on site. Most of the firewater was retained on site, by site containment measures, but some contaminated water escaped and had to be pumped back.- The Fire Service remained in attendance overnight. They relinquished control of the site early the next morning, the 31 October, allowing access on to the site for HSE and the Agency to begin investigation of the incident.","Main failings identified by the investigation:1) Failure to have an adequate system for the reception of waste onto the site in that containers of waste were not categorised according to a suitable hazard classification system. The classification according to hazard forms an essential part of a safe system for allocating appropriate storage locations.2) Failure to have an adequate system for the safe storage of different classes of hazardous materials. This system would have included, in addition to the hazard classification discussed above, the following elements which the site failed to implement:·a) an up to date plan of the storage areas showing appropriate locations for the different hazard categories. This would include suitable segregation/separation distances between the different hazard categories marked on the plan and would be derived from the risk assessmentb) an adequate segregation and separation policy as part of clear, easy to follow procedures to ensure that the findings of the risk assessment were implemented. These procedures should be linked to the procedures for pre-booking waste to be delivered to the site to ensure that designated storage areas, as marked on the site plan, are not exceededc) adequate instruction and supervision arrangements to ensure that the procedures and arrangements shown on the storage plan are implemented in practiced) adequate arrangements for ensuring that laboratory smalls are separated into drums according to hazard category and that these drums are then stored appropriately according to that hazard (ie not all drums of lab smalls stored in the same place irrespective of hazard)e) adequate arrangements for the exclusion of all ignition sources from areas where flammable liquids are stored, including the installation of suitable electrical equipment which will not introduce an ignition risk.3) Failure to carry out a suitable risk assessment into the hazards and risks associated with the storage of dangerous substances in containers. The failings included:·a) no consideration of specific substances or generic categories of hazardb) inadequate consideration of storage arrangementsc) inadequate consideration of control measures to prevent any incident except for reliance on employees' intervention to prevent escalation of any incidentd) no consideration or comparison of applicable guidancee) no specific consideration of laboratory smallsf) segregation was not considered as a safeguard or preventive measure for the prevention of fireg) assessment focuses on the personal safety of individual employees and does not adequately consider the risks of accidents that may cause harm to groups of persons or to persons outside the site boundary, or the risks to the environment.","The Site Operator has estimated that the cost of the incident has been approx 5 million euros, of which 1.4 million are insured and 3.6 million uninsured. This includes both direct costs from the incident (site restoration, loss of business etc) and other costs as a result of findings from the investigation (including the disposal of radioactive materials found on the site and the investigation of unauthorised disposal of waste at the site).In addition to the costs above there are the fines and costs from the Court cases described below and the charges made under COMAH by HSE (of approximately 120,000 euros). This gives a figure of approximately 7 million euros. Also as a direct consequence of the incident the site never returned to operation and has now permanently closed.There were no on-site injuries or ill-health. Nine people were taken to hospital for examination on the day of the incident (believed to be 4 fire service personnel, one policeman, and four local residents) but none were detained in hospital. Subsequently numerous reports of illnesses to local residents have been reported. Direct linking of these reports to the incident&nbsp; is unclear and is being investigated by the local health authority. None of the 17,500 tests carried out on over 500 environmental samples indicated any significant levels of contaminants off-site, although contaminated firewater run-offs is believed to have killed several hundred worms. The Environment Agency is continuing its' investigation into the long-term environmental effects. Environmental MonitoringA plume of smoke from the fire was driven by the high prevailing wind in a north, north-easterly direction over the village of Sandhurst.&nbsp; No samples from the plume were obtained. Modelling work on the contents and the fate of the plume was commissioned as part of the legal investigation. The findings of this work are to be used with the human health study.&nbsp; The Environment Agency and contractors undertook sampling of soil, water and air in and around the site.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was targeted as much as possible to identify whether residents and their properties had been exposed to significant levels of harmful substances from the fire and the subsequent flooding events. Evidence of contamination on site and where firefighting run off water had collected was found.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no evidence, from the media tested, to indicate that there had been widespread contamination off site at levels hazardous to health or the environment.&nbsp; Results of property monitoring were provided to residents and all results are available from the Environment Agency.Soil samples obtained in June 2001 showed no selenium or arsenic above the detection limit and contamination was restricted to elevated levels of phytotoxic metals (Lead Nickel and Copper) within the fire fighting wash water zone immediately adjacent to the site.&nbsp; All other results were at background levels.A macro invertebrate survey of the Horn's ditch (which is adjacent to the site) in July 2001 revealed biological quality had marginally improved from a previous survey undertaken in 1996.The Horn's ditch was also electro-fished in July 2001 and found roach and eels to be present. There is no historic data available for this stretch; however the results are what would be expected for such a watercourse.A survey of teasels (a form of thistle) was undertaken in the locality. This indicated an atmospheric discharge of selenium did take place during the incident in an area close to the CSG site.Subsequent sampling of nearby pylons and new growth teasels, both proved negative for selenium.In summary, the results of these surveys do not indicate any significant long term contamination and discussions will be undertaken with FSA, Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs and NFU to decide if further monitoring is appropriate.A precautionary pollution warning was issued to Severn Trent and Bristol Water but there was never considered to be a risk to drinking water abstraction as the Severn Trent abstraction is upstream of the incident. The flooding was preventing abstraction from the river Severn from taking place at the time of the incident and hence Bristol Water was also unaffected.Community Disruption:The fire resulted in the Police evacuating approximately 60 local people at the time, who were allowed to return to their homes that evening, the 30 October. The evacuation itself was hampered by the fumes from the fire. 13 people sought medical advice (mostly emergency service personnel but including some local residents) although none required admission to hospital.There was significant off-site concern, with the formation of a local pressure group, campaigning primarily to stop the site re-opening; this was successful as the site did close down following the incident.Media interest was also significant, in both local press (print &amp; TV) and national (print &amp; TV).There was much interest from the Local Member of Parliament with questions raised in Parliament and consequent interest by Ministers (a number of reports were prepared for the Deputy Prime Minister - details see C4c below).","The Fire service attended to deal with the fire, supported by the Police and Ambulance services. On the day, 60 people were evacuated for 12 hours. Further evacuations occurred the next week due to concern about possible ongoing off-site effects, compounded by serious flooding in the area. Emergency action and site restoration was co-ordinated by Gold Control (Police, Fire, County Council, Health etc).Official action taken - legal action: COMAH Prohibition NoticeThe measures taken for the prevention and mitigation of major accidents are seriously deficient in that site has not implemented the necessary measures for the safe storage, separation and segregation of flammable substances, incompatible chemicals, laboratory smalls and other packaged dangerous substancesOutcome: Notice complied with by site submitting revised COMAH notification (that they are no longer a COMAH site).Health and safety at Work etc Act 1974 Improvement NoticesHealth &amp; Safety at Work etc Act 1974 Section 2 (1) adequate arrangements for ensuring, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the health of your employees is protected from contact and/or proximity to radioactive materialsOutcome: Notice complied with.Health &amp; Safety at Work etc Act 1974 Section 2 (1), do not have suitable and sufficient arrangements for ensuring, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safe storage, separation and segregation of flammable substances, incompatible chemicals, laboratory smalls and other packaged dangerous substances.Outcome: Notice withdrawn when site closed.Management of Health &amp; Safety at Work Regulations 1999 Regulations 5, 8, 9 &amp; 13, did not establish and where necessary give effect to appropriate procedures to be followed in the event of serious and imminent danger to persons at work in your undertaking.Outcome: Notice withdrawn when site closed.Charges brought by HSE1.

On 1 November 2000, the CSG waste management licence was suspended to prevent the site receiving any more wastes whilst maintaining the environmental protection controls.&nbsp; The waste management licence was modified on 28 February 2002 under section 37(2) and 37(1)(a) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.&nbsp; The changes to the licence were widely consulted on.&nbsp; The most important amended conditions related to site management, supervision and control, detailed risk assessment and inclusion of a waste inventory.&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been no waste treatment or transfer at the site since the incident and the company sold the site in April 2003.","Measures to prevent recurrence: The Environment Agency National Action PlanIn the April 2001 report, the Agency detailed its National Action Plan for ensuring that the lessons learned from CSG Sandhurst are implemented across England and Wales. The plan covers seven key issues requiring review, these being:·Issue 1: Licensing arrangements at CSG Sandhurst·Issue 2: Licensing arrangements for chemical waste treatment and transfer facilitiesIssue 3: Emergency response arrangementsIssue 4: The balance of maintaining customer confidence in the licensing process and taking enforcement actionIssue 5: Officer awareness of Agency policy, procedures and practice on inspection and prosecutionIssue 6: Environmental policies and proceduresIssue 7: Health and Safety policy issuesSpecific actions are identified under each of the above issues, (21 in total), along with a manager responsible for taking the action forward and a target date for completion. HSE ActionsHSE paper has been presented to the Hazardous Installations Directorate (HID) (Land Division) Management Board on the lessons identified during the investigation of the CSG incident. The report identified issues in four key areas that have been acted upon, these being:·a) emergency response - substantial changes have been made to the Directorates emergency response arrangements.b) working with the Agency - HID have progressed common operating instructions and procedures when working with the Agency as the Competent Authority and specific arrangements have been made to work more closely where COMAH does not apply.c) prior regulation of the site - HID have reviewed the arrangements made for carrying out ""prior role"" enquiries and are about to produce additional guidance for staff.d) chemical waste treatment industry - a new joint inspection initiative involving the HSE and the Environment Agency was conducted in 2002 (see below).Joint Inspection InitiativeA joint HSE and Agency inspection/enforcement initiative was undertaken because of concerns that arose not only from this incident, but incidents at other such sites. The inspection initiative was necessary both to ensure that health, safety and environment provisions are complied with and to demonstrate better standards of control within the industry. The joint inspection initiative included:a) a seminar with representatives of the chemical waste treatment and storage industry.b) conducting inspections at waste treatment and transfer establishments.c) providing feedback to the chemical waste treatment and storage industry. The inspection initiative was formally launched at a seminar, held jointly by HSE and the Agency, on 14 May 2002 in Birmingham. The seminar was attended by about 50 representatives of the industry, including representatives from both large national companies and from small/medium enterprises. Senior HSE and Agency staff introduced the seminar, outlining issues of concern and the purpose and implementation of the inspection initiative.The seminar encouraged an open discussion with the industry that recognised the need to take action to ensure compliance and to improve the public perception of its activities. One of the outcomes was that the Agency, HSE and the industry will develop better communications and if necessary produce an industry code of practice to set standards for health and safety controls that are specific to this business. A report of the findings of the joint enforcement and inspection programme was published in February 2004.Useful References:""Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP into the major fire on 30 October 2000 at Cleansing Service Group Ltd, Upper Parting Works, Sandhurst Lane, Sandhurst, Gloucester GL2 9NQ""(http://www.hse.gov.uk/hid/sandhurst/csg1rept.htm)Progress Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP (April 2001)(http://www.hse.gov.uk/hid/sandhurst/sandhurst2.htm)Progress Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP (July 2002)(http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/csg_update_report_july_02.pdf)Final Report for Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Department for Works and Pensions (September 2003) (http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/csg_sep_03._609513.pdf)HSL Work following the fire at CSG Ltd., Upper Parting Works, 30th October 2000, FR/01/08HSL Report on potential mechanism for fire propagation at CSGHazardous Waste Storage and Treatment Facilities 2002/2003.

The blast furnace is used for the making of iron as part of the steelmaking process. At 23:00 hours a large leak of blast furnace gas was seen emerging from a circumferential crack in the downcomer by an operator who heard a hissing noise. The downcomer carries this gas from the top of the furnace to storage via the dust catcher. Leakage of blast furnace gas continued for 26 hours from the crack, which measured 2.3m in length and up to 3mm in width. The operator estimates that 24 tonnes of gas was released. The location of the crack was at one of the banded welded joints made during the construction of the downcomer, the incident did not trigger the on plant gas detection system. No ignition and fire of this extremely flammable and toxic gas occurred.","The primary cause of the incident was the occurrence of a gapping circumferential crack in sleeved welded joint number 7. &nbsp; The following factors are all relevant to this failure:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The condition of the refractory lining which may have led to differential thermal expansion across hot spots. The top gas temperature in the furnace could reach 900 deg. C causing the steel in unprotected areas to heat up to 670 deg C in a 5 minute excursion;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of the downcomer did not take into account that such temperatures could be reached, nor that parts of the refractory lining could be missing;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operation of the blast furnace was not adequately controlled over a number of years in that there were repeated high temperature excursions experienced in the downcomer;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality control procedures during the fabrication of the downcomer, including NDT, were inadequate. This led to defects in the fabrication and welding of the banded joints that were outside of design tolerances. There were also defects in the refractory lining caused by leaving wooden stop ends in place which burned away during operation to leave unprotected steel surfaces;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standards of workmanship found were below those expected for a structure of this type.In 2002, the completed fabricated downcomer was transported several hundred metres at ground level before being lifted into position for site welding at joints 1 and 9 and the refractory lining may have been damaged then","The outcome of the operator&rsquo;s failure to ensure that the downcomer was adequately designed, operated and maintained was a significant release of an extremely flammable and toxic gas over a 26 hour period, which was only stopped when a temporary steel patch repair was put in place. &nbsp; The release occurred at a fracture in joint number 7 which is around 50m above ground level. The release did not find an ignition source and was not able to accumulate in dangerous quantities near to personnel. &nbsp; There were no physical injuries reported.The company incurred substantial financial costs on work to repair the downcomer and comply with the Improvement Notice, and are considering whether to replace the downcomer in its entirety.","The company initially carried out a steel patch repair to the downcomer, which, as it was not considered as part of a formal management of change process, was poorly constructed to an inadequate design, and masked the extent of existing defects in joint 7 of the downcomer","Very early on in the investigation, the Competent Authority required the operator to comply with a statutory Improvement Notice served under Section 2(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, that required the following action to be taken&nbsp;in order to ensure the safety of employees and to demonstrate that the downcomer was adequately maintained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full review of the design of the downcomer on blast furnace number 5 should be carried out which should consider the adequacy of the design and whether integrity can be maintained under all foreseeable conditions of loading. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appropriate Non Destructive Testing (NDT) technique should be selected and qualified for use in examining the downcomer in order to determine significant defects that may be present. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualified NDT should be put into use on all circumferential welds on the downcomer, and on any other welds on the downcomer that the design review (see item 1) finds may be at risk of degradation. 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suitable thermographic camera(s) should be obtained and used in order to continuously monitor the condition of the downcomer and detect leakage of gases which may affect its integrity. 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A system of regular visual checks of the condition of the downcomer should be put in place, the results of which should be documented. The visual checks should include reference to both the downcomer itself and to images obtained from the thermographic camera(s) (see item 4) 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A time-bound plan for the future maintenance and thorough examination of the downcomer should be prepared.

910,965,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire of naphta in the isomerisation plant of a refinery released from a corroded pipe under repair,2007-10-31 11:25:00,2007-11-01 13:00:00,"At about 11.25am on 31st October 2007 a fire occurred on the C5/C6 Isomerisation plant (Unit 35) at the Petroplus Coryton Refinery.&nbsp; Approximately 48 tonnes of naphtha was released from an insulated pipe feeding the Dehexaniser fractionating column of Unit 35 and subsequently found a source of ignition.&nbsp; The pipe fed into the Dehexaniser column approximately 25 metres above ground.&nbsp; Subsequent examination of the failed pipe revealed that significant corrosion underneath the insulation had occurred on the underside of an elbow of the pipe, just before its entry into the Dehexaniser column.&nbsp; At the time of the incident Unit 35 had been taken temporarily off-line and its feed by-passed while planned repair work to the control system of the Unit’s Emergency Shutdown System (ESD) was carried out. Whilst attempting to rectify a fault on the logic system, the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) failed totally on two occasions.&nbsp; The system was re-set after each failure. However, in between the two failures the flow control valve, FC201, situated between the failed pipe and the Dehexaniser column, and which controls the flow of the Naphtha feed into the column, was manually re-set to 15% open, the normal initial setting for starting up the column.&nbsp; This reduction in the valve opening created a greater resistance to sudden product flow and hence a higher pressure pulse in the feed line (although still within the design capability of the pipework) when the second start up occurred.&nbsp; It is likely that this increase in pressure found a weakness in the feed line as a result of the corrosion, causing it to rupture and release the naphtha product.","The incident was primarily caused by a structural failure of a 200mm NB Carbon Steel feed pipe to the Dehexaniser column on Unit 35.&nbsp; The pipe was insulated and the external surface of the pipe wall beneath the insulation had corroded at a region where water had been collecting.&nbsp; The corrosion had reduced the pipe wall metal thickness to a level that could not support the internal pressure of the process fluids and a major process release occurred.&nbsp; The escaping extremely flammable liquid found an ignition source resulting in a fire which caused extensive damage to Unit 35. 
&nbsp;
Unit 35 was originally constructed in 1993 to relatively good standards of the time but nevertheless went into operation with a sub standard pipe installation.&nbsp; A walkway support bracket angle iron clashed with the pipe insulation weather cladding, which led to the water ingress at that location.&nbsp; The operating temperature of the pipe and wall wetting created conditions favourable to an accelerated corrosion mechanism.&nbsp; The corrosion progressed over time but remained unrecognised by the refinery ongoing integrity management systems until the failure occurred.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;
In 2001, when the refinery was under different ownership, a company wide report had been produced in relation to Corrosion under Insulation (CUI).&nbsp; This recognised that CUI was endemic throughout the company’s operations and a major threat.&nbsp; The refinery developed improved procedures for addressing the report recommendations but had not successfully implemented them up to the time of this incident.&nbsp; ","The outcome of the operator’s failure to recognise Corrosion under Insulation (CUI) at the incident location, and failure to adequately inspect and maintain the plant with respect to CUI, was a large release of an extremely flammable liquid that ignited causing&nbsp;a fire that burned for approximately 3 hours. 
&nbsp;
No physical injuries to any Petroplus employees or contractors were reported as a result of the incident.&nbsp; Accident reports were subsequently received from a contractor company operating at site regarding post incident shock experienced by five of their employees.
&nbsp;
The incident caused sufficient damage to close the refinery for approximately 8 weeks.&nbsp; Information given on the Petroplus website estimated that the costs of the repairs to the plant would be of the order of $15 million
&nbsp;
Firewater run-off was generally well managed and was contained on-site with little or no impact on the effluent treatment system. ","More than 20 on-site refinery fire crew attended the incident. Off-site emergency services also attended but were not physically involved in fire fighting.
&nbsp;
The emergency response to the incident highlighted issues regarding compliance with the evacuation procedures by both employees and contractors.&nbsp; Although all personnel were evacuated from site, the evacuation procedure, as written in the Coryton Incident Management plan, requires that on hearing the site major incident alarm, personnel should go to their local designated building, and to the assembly point therein.&nbsp; After the alarm sounded on the day of the incident approximately 220 contractors ignored this and logged out of site leaving via the main security gate.&nbsp; A small number of Petroplus employees also left site in this way. When a Petroplus employee was despatched to effect a head count, the contractors were subsequently found to have assembled in the contractor village on the West site. During their induction to site contractors are told that in the event of a major incident alarm they should go to their nearest designated building, and are provided with a book showing the locations of the designated buildings.
&nbsp;
The audibility of alarms at certain locations was poor which meant that it took some time before all personnel were informed of the hazard present on the plant.
&nbsp;
There was no record made, prior to the response, of the members of the site emergency crew.&nbsp; This would normally be done using a tag board located on the fire appliance in use.&nbsp; However, at the time of the incident the usual fire appliance that carries a tag board was out of service and the replacement appliance used did not carry a tag board.","As part of the reinstatement process and continued operations at the refinery, the Competent Authority required the operator to demonstrate that&nbsp;""on-refinery on-plot pipework had been assessed for the potential of corrosion under insulation (CUI)""; and&nbsp;""that steps taken to ensure that the occurrence of CUI affecting integrity of refinery on-plot pipework be reliably identified and that any necessary repairs undertaken"".&nbsp;

All on plot pipework meeting the conditions for most likelihood of failure from CUI (insulated and operating between minus 10oc and plus 150oc) and also with the most consequence of failure (Class 1 and 2 pipes, as per API 570) was targeted for inspection.&nbsp; This pipework was identified from the Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and two teams each consisting of a Mechanical Engineer, Production Operator, and an Inspection Engineer walked the lines looking for areas of concern e.g. water ingress points, damaged cladding, cladding obstructions, and visual symptoms such as rust staining or bulging of the cladding.&nbsp; This approach identified approximately 250 locations for insulation removal which was completed, together with pipework inspections and any resulting remedial work, before the unit was reinstated.&nbsp; Four incidents of CUI were identified, where the wall loss in the localised area had exceeded the corrosion allowance of the line.&nbsp; Repairs are scheduled to either replace or install temporary repair clamps.
&nbsp;
Petroplus finalised a formal inspection and management regime for CUI: ‘Equipment Maintenance Strategy EMS-MECH 36: Insulated Piping – Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) Management’ and developed an action plan for its implementation across the refinery. 
&nbsp;
Improvements are required on the evacuation procedures, roll-call arrangements and audibility of alarms. Inconsistencies between the Incident Management Plan and the Emergency Response Procedure need to be resolved. 
Petroplus have&nbsp;reviewed&nbsp;their procedures and&nbsp;actions&nbsp;will be monitored.&nbsp;"

Emergency shutdown and pressure relief&nbsp;is initiated, factory alarm activated and the plant evacuated according to normal procedure.

Accident Gravity Scale=4

Type of accident - Remarks: The major occurrence (1101) release of gas to the atmosphere was caused by the initiating event (1306) decomposition of NPK-fertiliser to NOx. The decomposition was only possible because of mixing two products, one containing copper and the other containing chloride, these formed together a product with self-sustaining decomposition properties. The temperature increase caused by the decomposition initiated minor secondary fires e.g. in electrical cables.Meteorological conditions - Precipitation: noneMeteorological conditions - Wind speed: 3.00Meteorological conditions - Wind direction: SMeteorological conditions - Wind stability: EMeteorological conditions - Temperature: 20.00Meteorological conditions - Remarks: None","The decomposition took place in a spherodizer for crystallisation and drying, due to decomposition or runaway reactions.&nbsp;Due to a preceding production of a product containing copper, and subsequent production of a chloride containing product, these two products were mixed and formed a product with self sustaining decomposition properties (class B fertiliser), which the spherodizer received. Caused by blocking of the outlet of the spherodizer the temperature and the retention time in the spherodizer increased. As a consequence decomposition of the product was initiated. This process generated mainly nitrogen oxides which escaped to the building and through the stack. 
The rate of decomposition/run away process was so fast, that the operators were not able to initiate water spraying of the spherodizer.","There were only material losses.
The citizens were warned out to a distance of 2 kilometres in the wind
direction. No damage outside the factory building. No persons in the
city were affected. The concentration of nitrogen oxides are not known. Nobody from the off-site population was injured. Firstly it was Saturday morning (weekend), secondly due to early warning, thirdly the concentration of nitrogen oxides was not high enough to cause harm as most of the gas was vented through the  factory stack. Ecological harm - Remarks: Expectation of ecological harm or damage should not be expected for that type of accident because of dilution of the gasses escaping from the stack.
Water used for stopping decomposition was transported to the public water treatment plant.Disruption of community life: Roads close to the site were closed by police.

915,1047,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Flash-fire during upload of DMC (Dimethyl carbonate) under vaccum condition,2013-09-10 04:00:00,2013-09-10 04:10:00,"On 10 September 2013, two operators were concluding the filling phase of dimethyl carbonate into reactor R20 of unit RS1 from 200 litre sheet metal drums, using vacuum suction with flexible hose connected to the reactor for the loading phase, up to a total of 849 kg (four whole drums plus a residual fraction of a fifth drum placed on the scales). The product was transferred in an open cycle.
When about 10-15 litres were left in the fourth barrel and the barrel was to be emptied completely, tipping the barrel to provide greater depth, and presumably in the subsequent phase of removal of the filling lance, the dimethyl carbonate vapours in the barrel itself ignited, causing the barrel to explode, the bottom to become detached and the consequent immediate ignition of all the product, with an impact area limited to the sampling point (around two metres). The first operator, who was responsible for handling the flammable products, was hit by burning dimethyl carbonate (presumably a flash fire) and sustained burns to much of his body. He subsequently died after around ten days of hospital treatment. The other operator, supporting the handling operations, fell to the ground a short distance away and suffered bruises and minor burns; he returned to work after 36 days of accident leave.
","It is reasonable to assume that the cause of the ignition was a build-up of electrostatic charge on the hose and the filling lance, both made of plastic. That material, due to its dielectric properties, is not suitable for the handling and movement of the flammable substance, as is stated in the safety sheet for the substance (section 10).
The procedure for handling flammable substances that was in force at the time of the event gave general guidance concerning chemical compatibility and earthing of the system, and the proper identification of the specific equipment.
Interviews conducted with some operators revealed no specific training on handling procedures.","The first operator, who was responsible for handling the flammable products, was hit by burning dimethyl carbonate (presumably a flash fire) and sustained burns to much of his body. He subsequently died after around ten days of hospital treatment.
The other operator, supporting the handling operations, fell to the ground a short distance away and suffered bruises and minor burns; having also reported psychological traumas, he returned to work after 36 days of accident leave.
No damage to the buildings, equipment or materials present in the unit were recorded.","At the time of the incident, only the two operators were present in the area concerned.
In the initial phase (a few minutes), the shift supervisor and other operators from the unit and the laboratory came running from the upper floor and the ground floor having been attracted by the noise created by the event.
The laboratory operators carried out first aid.
One of the operators from the quality laboratory responsible for communication proceeded to make the emergency call (112), the call to the health and safety manager and, subsequently, to other members of the management team.
Two ambulances, the Carabinieri (police), the fire brigade, and a rapid response car from the local health authority thus attended the scene.
The seriously injured operator was taken to a specialist burns unit.
The other operator involved received hospital treatment and was then discharged.
Following the events, company staff completed the interrupted operations, with the approval of the authorities present, for the sole purpose of making the reactor safe.
","The company acted quickly to implement and report, in its safety management system, a new version of the procedure for handling flammable substances, which is more explicit about chemical compatibility and earthing the system, and the proper identification of the specific equipment (BGB-ILS-008 rev. B of 16 September 2013, 'Handling and use of flammable raw materials H225 H226 — R10 and R11 in RS1').
The company is currently looking into a new, fixed filling system for flammable raw materials, in a closed cycle and/or a nitrogen atmosphere, from mobile containers, so as to rule out the possibility of inappropriate operations.
The Commission points out that the risk related to electrostatic charges when transferring products from small containers tends to be underestimated. In order to limit that risk, specific management measures are essential. It may also be worth considering using closed cycle transfer systems. It would be useful to look closely at these aspects in the context of assessments by the competent authorities and during inspections.

Description of the situation prior to the accident:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.1.2006 - technology shutdown of HCN and cyanide production. At the time the AKH production was not in operation, DPG production was in normal operation as was the pumping of wastewater from the hydraulic barrier. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only wastewater from the DPG and hydraulic barrier was lead to the WWTP - detoxication sump. In order to clean the equipment on 8.1.2006 the cyanide production equipment remained shutdown. Once the WWTP (chemical) container was filled, the wastewater was pumped to the WWTP - detoxication sump for further treatment. Monitoring of the detoxication sump is done both by a floating gauge that signals that the sump is full and by visual inspection by service staff. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night shift 8/9.1.2006 - according to the staff working on the night shift no variation from the normal operation was noted after shutting down the HCN and cyanide production. During the night the temperature dropped from approx. 13°C to -15°C. Due to the fact that water leaking during shutdown of production is much more concentrated, pretreatment was performed on detoxication sump 3 which was unsuccessful. A responsible staff member was made aware of this by telephone at approx 11 o'clock pm. He decided to fill the sump and that treatment would be performed on the morning shift. In the second half of the shift no employees were working in the vicinity of the sumps neither were the sumps visually inspected. Employees left the plant at 6 o'clock am.2. Temporal course of the accident in the area of the WWTP - detoxication sump at LZD and subsequent action taken:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.1.2006 the detoxication sump WWTP was found to be completely full in the early hours; a responsible employee determined that there was no overflow from the sump. Responsible employee who filled the sump took these immediate measures:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conformity with the working instruction PI 1201-16-02; point 5.1 (deviation from the normal technological regime) a submerged pump was used to pump the content of sump 3 (full sump) to sump 2 to reduce its volume.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The equipment was checked to determine why there was no signal that the sump was full. It was determined that the floating signal gauge was frozen (due to the low temperatures during the night). The indicator of the gauge was freed manually and the gauge immediately began to operate with no problem.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concentration of the discharged water was checked and found not to exceed the limit values.After taking these measures he checked the other parts of the WWTP and chemical WWTP. On his return he realized that the pump hose was pulled out of the side of the sump. On first inspection no water was flowing from the hose and nothing indicated that any water had escaped from the sump. Therefore he did not evaluate the situation at this time as an accident and did not report anything to his superiors. This information only came to light in his statement dated 10.2.2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.1.2006 (in the early hours) - service staff at the Podebrady and Nymburk dams informed the water management control center of the Labe river catchment authorities of considerable fish fatalities near the hydraulic power station. The police, CIZP, and the local fishery unions in Podebrady and Nymburk were informed immediately. Analysis of the dead fish determined an accidental degradation of water quality caused by an unknown material, which was subsequently determined to be total cyanide.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.1.2006 (Friday) - CIZP performed an inspection at LZD in order to determine the possibility of a release of cyanide. After a local investigation they determined that the presence of cyanide in the Labe could have originated at LZD. The CIZP hypothesis stated that most probably an overflow of the detoxication sump occurred and water was released through the company's sewerage system to the Labe.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.1.2006 (Monday) - an internal committee was set up to determine:·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not the ecological accident was caused by contaminated water from LZD·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual cause of the accident·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The temporal course of the accident·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective remedial measures4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.1.2006 - technical equipment was inspected at the WWTP - detoxication sump to determine the possible cause of the accident. From the first information given by staff on the morning shift it was determined that during the change of shifts on 9.1. detoxication sump 3 was found to be completely full whereby they pumped part of the contents and that they subsequently found the signal gauge to be frozen and fixed this problem. There was no mention at this stage that the pump hose was found beside the sump. Based on this information the floating signal gauge was checked and was taken into consideration during the investigation of the occurrence and causes of the accident, and relevant remedial measures were taken i.e. increase in frequency of physical inspection in the area of discharge of wastewater from LZD.&nbsp; 5. 16.1.2006 - CIZP performed another inspection where further details of the accident came to light including the measures taken to avoid a repeat of the accident. 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.1.2006 - considering the local investigation performed together with CIZP and the information given by staff of the morning shift the Commission stated that on the 9.1.2006 there was most probably an accident at LZD involving a release of an undefined volume of discharge water to the Labe. 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.1-17.12006 - based on point 6 remediation of the surroundings of the WWTP - detoxication sump was performed including measures to limit release to the sewerage system. 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.1.2006 - LZD presented its statement at a press conference that based on internal investigation and the conclusion of CIZP an accident occurred on 9.1.2006 which led to the release of wastewater with an undefined content of cyanide to the Labe.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.1.2006 - LZD announced a major accident pursuant to Article 15 paragraph 2 of Act 353/1999 Coll. to the relevant state administration within the legal deadline (i.e. within 24 hours of determining an accident occurred).10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19.1.2006 - first negotiations between LZD and the local fishery unions on compensation for damages caused by the accident.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.1.2006 - a report was submitted to CIZP on remedial measures to be taken and their deadlines for elaboration. 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23.1.2006 - internal guidelines (organization regulations) were issued at LZD to improve controls and record keeping of the discharge of wastewater and to establish further measures to be taken to solve issues of wastewater discharge at LZD.13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;24.1.2006 - Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. was commissioned to elaborate an expert opinion on the situation and the possible causes of the malfunction of the floating signalization gauge.14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26.1.2006 - Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. submits his expert opinion to LZD.15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27.1.2006 - CIZP issued a report on the fulfillment of remedial measures set by CIZP.16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;27.1.2006 - CIZP issued with the expert opinion on the malfunction of the floating signalization gauge.17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27.1.2006 - meeting between LZD and the Labe River Catchment Authority at which the accident was reviewed and proposals for further steps to be taken and cooperation between the two bodies were made.18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31.1.2006 - LZD and the fisheries sign an agreement of financial compensation for losses caused by the accident.19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27.1.2006 - 16.2.2006 - based on the conclusions of Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. and the information on total cyanide contamination in the river (taken from Labe River Catchment Authority reports) it was determined that the malfunction of the gauge could not be the only cause of the accident. For this reason and based on further investigation, the internal Committee came to the conclusion that human error was to some extent involved in the accident.20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.2.2006 - internal investigation with staff members of energy production and in particular those who were preset on the night and morning shifts prior to and during the accident. This resulted in the opinions of individual employees on the course of the shifts prior to and during the accident. In particular Mr. Charamzy (WWTP - sump service staff member), Mr. Krutsky (WWTP - sump supervisor) and Mr. Soukup (head of energy production). 21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.2.2006 - on the basis of the results of the internal investigation the general manager was informed of the possible causes of the accident by an internal memo which stated that several human errors occurred during the accident, including:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor did not correctly evaluate the state of the detoxication sumps during the night shift or organize the activity of the service staff,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor acted carelessly during pumping of the detoxication sump,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor poorly evaluated the situation&nbsp; from the point of view of the possible release of toxic water and accident occurrence and did not inform his subordinates,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor did not divulge all of the facts important in determining the causes of the accident during the first internal investigation.22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21.2.2006 - LZD informed the public at a press conference that based on the internal investigation it was determined that other than the technical malfunction, human error was also to blame for the accident.3. Remedial measures taken after discovery of accident:The following measures were taken at LZD after the accident of 9.1.2006 (adopted in cooperation with CIZP):Immediate measures taken after determining the accident:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rainwater sewerage system was shut down in the area of the WWTP - detoxication sump and the sewerage system was temporarily insulated with a VAPO pneumatic filling. When the climatic conditions improve the outlet will be concreted. Concreting was performed in the second half of 2006.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signalization system was improved with doubling the amount of floating signalization gauges-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical checks of the working of the floating signalization gauges at the beginning of each shift change were initiated.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expert opinion on the analysis of the state of the signalization gauge in sump 3 was commissioned with emphasis on the possible technical malfunction on 9.1.2006.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequency of visual checks on filling of detoxication sumps increased to once per hour at least for each sump.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above-ground supply pipes were checked for integrity of joints.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pump hoses were changed and an overall inspection of pumps used in the WWTP - detoxication sump was performed.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequency of analyses of discharged wastewater from LZD outlets increased, specifically for presence of cyanide min. once every 2 hours on specific objects. -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system for control and recording of wastewater discharge from the detoxication sumps was changed.

Evaluation of the actions of LZD employees during the accident, verification of operative processes of employees and their compliance with the law and LZD internal guidelines:Description of the WWTP - detoxication sumpWastewater from the production of AKH and DPG are lead to the detoxication sump from the hydraulic barrier and wastewater with a high content of CN ions for rinsing of cyanide production equipment. Under normal operational conditions the following average daily volumes are lead to the WWTP - detoxication sumps:from DPG production &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 - 120 m3from AKH production and HCN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30 - 35&nbsp; m3from Hydraulic barrier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 - 15&nbsp; m3Wastewater from the production of HCN and NaCN are lead to the chemical WWTP, which treats water with high content of CN ions. Toxic water in the WWTP-detoxication sump usually has toxic levels ranging in the hundreds of mg CN-/l.The total capacity of the detoxication sumps under normal operational conditions is 250 m3 (40% of which is suspension). This volume guarantees sufficient wastewater containment for detoxication. In exceptional cases (malfunction of the striper, malfunction in the production of cyanide, shut down of HCN or cyanide production) the WWTP-detoxication sump is used for disposal of wastewater from the cyanide production or HCN. This wastewater is more toxic with values can range in the thousands of mg CN-/l. The volume of wastewater that can be lead to the detoxication-WWTP is given by the method of treatment and retention of the individual apparatus for the production of HCN and cyanide, and ranges in (max.) tens of m3.Description of the activities of service staff at the WWTP - detoxication sumpThe internal guidelines PI 1201-16-02 ""Detoxication sump"" and TR 1201-04-02&nbsp; ""Detoxication sump"" were issued for operation of the technology. Employees are made familiarly with theses internal guidelines which are constantly made available and are obliged to follow them. Wastewater discharge is recorded on the form ""summery of pumped sumps, volumes of wastewater and consumption of raw materials"". The detoxication process and results of analytical evaluation are written on the operational sheet ""Detoxication sump (pumping, treatment)"". Apart from during the main shift, analytical evaluation is performed at the weekends and during unmanned shifts by the water management laboratories at LZD. During the main shift analytical evaluation is performed during inter-operational controls. The results are recorded in the relevant laboratory logs and on the operation sheet ""Detoxication sump (pumping, treatment)"". Technological regulation in Chapter 7.1. Deviations from the normal technological regime includes the procedure during treatment and discharge of wastewater for possible very alkaline water, large volumes of cyanide ions and in the case that the wastewater can no be treated using the standard methods. In this case it is permitted to pump the wastewater over a longer period of time in order to reach the required limit concentrations. The values of contamination in the discharged wastewater from the LZD site in indicator CN ions (toxic and total) are set by a valid permit issued by the relevant water management authority, which is the environmental and agriculture department of the regional office of the central Bohemian region. The permit was issued 17.8.2004 and is valid to 31.12.2006.Values for wastewater discharged from the LZD site are as follows:- CNtox&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 mg/l- CNtotal&nbsp; 10 mg/l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All activities were performed by the service staff during the accident of the 9.1.2006 according to the above-mentioned technological documentation. The only error of the service staff was to not secure the pumping hose and to not pay adequate attention during pumping. On the other hand though, the WWTP - detoxication sump is not an area that is permanently manned i.e. staff members perform other duties in conformity with their work responsibilities, the WWTP - detoxication sump therefore is not constantly manned.Another error of service staff was to not inform superiors or investigators of the accident of the hose that was pulled out and lying on the edge of the sump.5. Conclusion:On the basis of the internal investigation of committee the following conclusions have been made:The accident of 9.1.2006 occurred due to several factors. The low temperatures had a negative effect on the formation of nontoxic forms of cyanide and on the floating signalization gauge.&nbsp; This however was not the main cause of the accident. The Commission states that the service staff of the WWTP - detoxication sump in essence acted in conformity with valid internal guidelines, even though the accident occurred, whose cause was the carelessness of service staff, and in particular:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; insufficient securing or no securing at all of pump hose during pumping wastewater from sump 3 to sump 2. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carelessness during pumping of wastewater from sump 3 to sump 2, and not discovering that the pump hose on the edge of the sump was extracted, which was most probably the cause of the release of toxic wastewater to the company's sewerage system and subsequently to the Labe.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not informing subordinates of the extracted pump hose on the edge of the sump, and subsequently not informing management during the investigation of the accident.Criminal responsibility of service staff flowing from the above mentioned errors is in the full competence of the authorities acting in legal procedures.After evaluating the adopted measures, both immediate and subsequent, the Commission states that the scope of these measures was and is adequate for the occurrence of an emergency situation and that all measures are duly fulfilled.Done in Kolin 31.3.2006Signatures of Committee Members:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ing.

The feeding control was set on ""manual operation"" which according to experience creates the feeding conditions foreseen by the operating instructions (manual).Between 11:00 and 11:30 hrs there were three heating gas breakdowns (failures of the supply), due to the fact that a too high heating gas pressure released the corresponding shut-off of the supply. The heating gas supply was restarted each time. About 12:33 hrs. alarms signaled raised temperatures of the reaction-tube walls. It was attempted to reduce the temperature by increasing the EDC (1,2-dichloroethane) feed.About 12:39 hrs temperature alarm was released for the pyrolysis gas (cracking gas) and a further raise in the temperatures of the reaction-tube walls. Around 12:44 the extinguishing of furnace flames was started. The EDC feed was increased further. At 12:52 hrs another temperature alarm was released for the pyrolysis gas (cracking gas).

Earlier that morning, we had switched over to oil fuel in order to scan for defective non-return valves on the water-injection purging circuit. A transfer from natural gas to oil fuel takes place every 15 days in the period mid-October to March to prevent problems with fuel solidifying in ducts due to colder external temperatures. After the test we switched back to natural gas and proceeded to restart the unit at approximately 11:48. During each start-up, the gas valves (regulating valve SRV and on-off valves VS4, GCV1, GCV2 and GCV4) are tested for tightness. The test did not detect any problems. We therefore proceeded with the start-up by opening the gas supply and activating the spark plugs. At approximately 11:58, excessive vibrations were detected, corresponding to the time of the explosion (methane deflagration) in the boiler. This triggered the shutdown of the gas turbine and the whole unit.","The accident occurred in the boiler after the gas turbine. Malfunction of the gas-turbine’s shut-off valve/pressure-regulating valve (SRV) led to an accumulation of gas in the boiler during start-up, which exploded when the gas turbine was fired up. After the start-up tightness checks, valve SRV remained 3.5 % open. More specifically: During speed reduction, with valve VS4 closed (and tight), the pressure between the valves remained at 0 bars. On attaining the firing speed (420 rpm), the gas valves are opened (valve VS4, the main GCV1 gas valve is opened to 16 %) and the spark plugs are charged (for maximum 30 seconds). With the SRV remaining 3.5 % open, the pressure in the inter-valve section settled at 16 bars (it is normally 3.8 bars). An excessive gas flow was directed into the combustion chambers and the boiler (+7000 Nm³/h as against +2500 Nm³/h under normal circumstances with DCS).
Firing occurred 19 seconds (normally +3 seconds) after main gas valve GCV1 started to open. This incident was caused by the SRV valve malfunction after the tightness test, but also by a failure to check the functioning of valves. After the tightness test, there were no further checks on the fully-closed positions of valves or abnormal pressure.",There were no injuries or fatalities. The main damage was to the recovery boiler: the violent explosion destroyed the lower section of the boiler and deformed the connecting duct muffler. There were no adverse effects on the turbine or the heat exchanger tubes. ,The process was stopped and the facility was restored to a safe condition. ,Need to provide for checks of the real position of regulating valves during start-up procedures.

In addition, an order was issued on 10th August giving the operator notice to install these devices within one month.","In May of the same year, the operators had carried out an Internal Emergency Plan training, based on the scenario of a fire involving one of the alcohol tanks. Therefore, the emergency services knew the site well, and the emergency equipment was set up quickly, in the context of a smoothly working emergency response system.The way in which the emergency response operations were carried out did not cause any particular remarks by the inspectorate.Direct protection devices against lightning (lightning conductors) were installed, but perhaps the wiring system designed for carrying the currents originating from atmospheric discharges (equipotential bonding between different tanks and the earthing points), located in determined positions to protect specific areas against lightning hazards, were inadequate.Also the absence of flame arrestors has contributed to setting off the explosion.According to the evidence collected, it appears that another lightning struck a few moments before near to an electricity tower. The energy conducted to earth has certainly caused changes in the soil characteristics near the storage site.In conclusion, it must be remarked that&nbsp; 23,000 litres of&nbsp; emulsifiers and 7000 m3 of water were used during this accident."
937,584,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Release of methane and of a small amount of ammonia vapours in an ammonia synthesis unit,1987-12-23 12:00:00,1987-12-23 00:00:00,"SAFETY SYSTEMS OR OPERATORS INTERVENTION:Operator in control room activated emergency procedures including fire alarm and emergency shut-down ot the plant.OTHER SYSTEMS INVOLVED AND OPERATING CONDITIONS:Damages to pipes on adjacent pipe-rack resulting in the release of methane and of a small amount of ammonia vapours.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A 24"" pipe carrying synthesis gas (Hydrogen = 43.5%, Nitrogen = 14.08%, Methane = 0.2%, Carbon Dioxide = 12.3%, Water = 29.3% by volume) ruptured. About 60 kg of hydrogen contained in the gas initially released formed an unconfined vapour cloud and exploded. The explosion was audible up to 2.5 km from the factory and it caused considerable alarm to the residents. Lengths of pipe on either sides of the rupture were displaced as a result of the depressurization. An 8 m length pipe downstream rotated upon itself of about 380° while a 12 m length pipe upstream rotated of about 90°. This 12 m section damaged the pipes on an adjacent pipe-rack rupturing the vent header from the desulphurizer unit and causing the release of approximately 600 kg of methane. The hydrogen released from the upstream section of the 24"" pipe subsequently burned as a jet-fire about 70 m long. The released methane initially burned as a cloud (60 m long) and then as a jet-fire from the ruptured vent header. On hearing the explosion and by the indications from the plant instrumentation of a major leak, the plant operator shut-off the supply of natural gas to the plant and shut-down the individual units. After about 5 minutes the fire extinguished. A small amount of ammonia vapours which had been released from a fitting on a vapour return line (damaged by the 12 m section pipe) dispersed harmlessly.","INITIATIMG EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The rupture of a 24"" pipe resulted in the release and ignition of a hydrogen vapour cloud. The ruptured pipe caused further damages resulting in release and ignition of methane and in the release of a small amount of ammonia that dispersed harmlessly.CAUSES:Metallurgical examination of the 24"" pipe showed that a fatigue failure occurred, induced by thermal cycling. Examination of the fracture faces of the ruptured seam weld showed a significant amount of fatigue cracking initiating at the bore of the pipe along a length of about 3 metres of the weld downstream the water injection point. At the upstream end, the rupture propagated circumferentially around the pipe as a shear failure. At the other end, the rupture arrested at a circumferential weld and then propagated as a circumferential tear in the pipe material. The spray pattern from the nozzle was such that water at 80°C was intermittently hitting the inner surface of the pipe and quickly cooling the surface. The process gas stream at a temperature of 230°C quickly heated up the pipe wall again only for it to be quickly cooled by water impingement at the start of the next cycle. This phenomenon which affected a number of areas in the pipe wall downstream of the water injection nozzle caused a number of small fatigue cracks which ultimately developed so that the material near the longitudinal weld failed. Subsequent examination of the spray nozzle showed that this may have been distorted for some time prior to the accident causing preferential impingement possibly enhancing the failure mechanism although it is not concluded that this distortion was the main cause of the failure. There was a two year history of previous leaks in welds further downstream on this section of pipe which it is now recognized were due to the same cause. At the time the company wrongly diagnosed the cause as external stress corrosion cracking.The accident occurred due to the rupture of a 24"" pipe (code 5102) caused by a cyclic fatigue corrosion (code 5104). The cyclic fatigue corrosion was induced by thermal cycling. The underlying causes that led to the corrosion of the pipe were: a plant design inadequate (code 5308), insufficient maintenance procedures (code 5313) and an inadequate management attitude problem (5302) because it failed to clarify the causes of previous accidents.","MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion damaged the pipes on an adjacent pipe-rack and a heat exchanger. It also caused the glasses breakage and superficial damages to the buildings. Outside the establishment the explosion caused the breakage of a small amount of windows and damaged the roof tiles on one house. The cost of the damage has been estimated at about 0.65 M Euros.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The effects of the explosion are shown on a map attached to the Original Report. There were no off-site significant overpressure. At the nearest residence at a distance of 200 metres a small amount of glass breakage occurred (the overpressure was estimated to be about 2 kPa) but, in any case, the explosion was audible up to 2.5 km from the
factory and it caused considerable alarm to the local residents. 193 people lived within a 0.5 km radius from the plant.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire alarm was activated and the Company's on-site emergency procedures were put into operation. The supply of natural gas to the plant was cut off and the plant shut-down sequentially. Subsequently, the whole ammonia plant was depressurized and routine decommissioning procedures were activated. After about 5 minutes, the fires became extinguished due to the exhaustion of available combustible gases.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The external emergency services were not called by the Company but they were activated by an alarmed resident in the area. The accident was over before the off-site services arrived on the scene.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: The plant had to be modified so that the water injection system will be replaced by a reboiler system. This will eliminate the probable cause of the pipeline rupture (i.e. the presence of water droplets within a much hotter gas stream in the pipe). Parts of the plant where a similar phenomenon was possible (high-pressure steam desuperheaters used during start-up only) were examined, but no were detected. When the Original Report was prepared, the company was undertaken an assessment of its preventative maintenance procedures and expertise."

Instrument air pressure dropped but no back up air available, being off-line because of maintenance.  Plant shut-down procedure initiated but isolation valve connecting high pressure gas vessel ultimately failed to close due to a) the main instrument air being unavailable and b) the final safety instrument air reservoir for closing the hydraulic isolation valve having an open drain line ie was unpressurised.","Maintenance on safety air reservoir system to hydraulic isolation valve 2 yrs previous probably resulted in air reservoir being left with open drain to atmosphere.  When instrument air pressure fell during production, back-up works air supply not available and plant shut-down sequence initiated by operators.  Hydraulic isolation valve cycled to allow molten polymer/waste ethylene to move out of separator (to prevent it cooling/solidifying) to hopper (and remaining plant).  Hopper instrumentation detecting overpressure then required valve to close and allow ethylene to be diverted to process plant to reduce pressure, but pressure in safety air balance reservoir system quickly depleted.  Ultimately the isolation valve between the 2 vessels failed to close, allowing low pressure hopper to be overpressurised  and bursting disc safety feature to operate.","No injuries, plant damage (apart from bursting disk), fire or explosion. Vented gas dissipated to atmosphere where it was diluted to safe level.",On-site Emergency actions taken immediately to locate and manually close isolation valve between high and low level pressure vessels which then cut off source of ethylene to the low pressure vessel and stopped the venting. All plant shut down and made safe and investigations into the cause of the incident started. Plant/equipment design procedures reassessed.,under review.

Emergency services took eight employees who felt unwell (nausea, headache, vomiting) to hospital from a neighbouring company. They were discharged soon afterwards. The operator did not trigger its emergency response plan.
The oxidiser of the unit producing calcium phenates stopped automatically when it was detected that the flame, which had previously been unstable, had been extinguished. It had already stopped during the night at around 01.00 but without significant impact. The stopping of the oxidiser caused that of the phenates unit, the H2S and mercaptan-type sulphur-containing effluents of which are also treated by the oxidiser (after passing through a tank in which those with the highest H2S content are converted). If they are not oxidised, these sulphur-containing effluents are released to the stack untreated. A similar incident three weeks previously affected five people at the same neighbouring company. The site was temporarily shut down as an administrative measure until the oxidiser was working reliably. The site risk assessment had not anticipated the accidental release of mercaptans. Production losses stood at several thousand euros. An expert's report showed the oxidiser flame to be outside the flame detector field as a result of combustion instability. This instability was caused by excessive dilution of the fuel (natural gas) with surplus oxidant (surplus oxygen and nitrogen contained in the effluent to be treated arriving at a rate of 8 000 kg/h). The expert's report made a number of technical recommendations to improve combustion (reduce and preheat the surplus oxidant, split the injection of fuel, etc.) and suggested that an activated charcoal filter be installed to trap mercaptans and H2S upstream of the chimney should the oxidiser stop working. The operator made these improvements to the oxidiser.

The material damage amounts to ca. 40.000 DM 20.000 EURO.","The fire department was alarmed and used water sprinkling to abate the ammonia mist. The ammonia release was stopped only after 12 hours. Because there were no isolating valves at all in the whole piping system of the ice rink, a part of the ammonia was released through the leaking pipe and was abated with water. The rest of the ammonia was able to be conveyed from the filling station to a water-filled snow pit through flexible pipes.","In the future, all works carried out by building companies will be supervised even more accurately by the municipal construction administration.

This resulted in an explosion and fire.,"High temperature sulphur corrosion caused by negligent maintenance in combination with strong internal pollution in the convection tube. The seriousness of the situation was not recognised when the first signs of the incident were visible. The procedure prescribed that the operators had to shut down the furnace in case of detection of fire inside the furnace. To do this in a controlled manner,  they had to close valves underneath the furnace. This means that there were no efficient measures taken to protect the personnel present. Automatic shut-down was possible, but not in an controlled manner. Maintenance management was inadequate. Replacement of pressurised parts was not documented. As a result of this the age of specific parts was not known. The return bends of the convection tube involved had been replaced in 1997, but not the straight pipe (37 years old) itself.","One operator was at work in the section. After detecting fire around 14.50 in the furnace, evacuation of the area was started. A second operator arrived at the scene, presumably for the change of shift. At 14.55 a large fire started. Both operators were seriously injured. The next morning one of them died in hospital, his colleague is still in hospital with severe injuries.People - Remarks:At one point after detecting the tube leakage a total of 8 persons gathered around the installation to discuss the measures to be taken. When the tube collapsed fortunately only two operators were present. They took over the shift. They sustained serious injuries and were taken to hospital. One of them died the next day.Material Loss - Remarks:Estimate: 500.000 euro (excluding production losses of 6 months)Affected Area: installation","First objective of the fire department was to cool the direct surroundings, as heat radiation was limited. The large amount of water caused the sewer to overflow. Sewers of refineries always contain an amount of carbohydrates. These remain on the surface of the water.

943,1119,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Smoulder fire,2018-08-10 14:00:00,2018-08-12 12:00:00,"Friday afternoon 10th August 2018 a plume (smoke) was seen coming from the pile of Vale SAS (industrial byproduct containing nickel sulphide). Ca. 4000 tonnes of Vale SAS where piled up in the warehouse. After taking contact with the owner of the product, the pile was cooled down with water. The advice given by the owner&nbsp;of the product was not to distribute the pile of powder over a larger area by the wheel loaders but to just cool it with large amounts of water. Friday evening a technician saw smoke coming from the pile again and again the advice was to cool the product with water. The technician monitored the situation during the advised period of time and when the situation was considered to be under control, the technician left the premises.
The owner of the product wrote down in the SDS that it was strictly forbidden to cool the product with water, but that it has to be distributed by a wheel loader. A few hours later the advice changed from distribution by a wheel loeader to extinguishing and cooling with large amounts of water. This cooling with large amounts of water was done by purpose of stopping the chemical reaction. There has never been a direct beam of water on the smouldering fire.
Saturday morning 11th August 2018 at 10 a.m. a large amount of smoke was seen by another technician and by a contractor who were present because they had to start construction works. They were only present for this construction work since the company doesn't operate in the weekend. They immediately contacted the emergency services. The fire brigade came to the scene and in consultation with the owner of the product, the fire brigade decided to distribute the product by wheel loaders in a layer of limited hight over the surface. Saturday evening while still spreading the product a larger pocket of smouldering product was found. By excavating this smouldering product, the smouldering fire intensified which made it impossible to further work with theel loaders in the warehouse. The fire brigade desided not to follow the earlier advise not to use water any more and started to extinguish the smouldering fire with water, shortly after midnight.
Due to the toxic (SO2) smoke from the fire, a wide area around the company was evacuated. Several neighbouring companies had to shut down due to this evacuation.
The fire brigade stayed on the premises till&nbsp;noon on 12th August . They have extinguished the fire with large amounts of fire water. The water in the warehouse and in the drain was sucked into vacuum trucks after the fire was extinguished and was brought to the owner of the product for treatment.
A part of the dock was sealed by putting an oil containment boom in one corner. At the surface of the water were floating a number of yellow ‘plugs’, who were sucked and transported to the owner of the product for further analysis.
The contained water which was collected in the dirty water tank was treated by the company itself. The dirty water tank was filled for about 85% after the incident.
Because of the extent of the incident comprising 4000 ton environmentally dangerous product, this incident is to be considered a major accident according to the Seveso legislation.","The main causes of the accident are:
- No information from the product owner to the operator about the risk on smauldering fire
- Not sufficient follow up on the first smauldering fires.
- Wrong information about the intervention method by the product owner. In practice the fire was only put out after using water. Spreading out of the product and covering with sand is also possible in theory, but impossible for large storage quantities like in this case.","Some people in the neighbourhoud and some staff of emergency services have suffered breathing problems due to the smoke inhalation. The extinguishing water was contaminated and a large part of it flowed into the docks. Another part was collected in the sewer system of the company. The exact quantity which was released in the water in the docks is not known. It is known and it was seen&nbsp;that some yellow plugs were floating on the surface of the water after the ending of the incident. They were eventually removed by the personnel of the owner of the product.
The structure of the warehouse was weakened because of the high tempertures of the smouldering fire. But the strength of the building structure was evaluated as sufficent which admits a continued use of the warehouse for storing products. The concrete elements were not damaged and the steel structure was (lightly) corroded but is cleaned to prevent further corrosion from happening. The roof was repaired in two phases:

- first a quick repair to guarantee the structural safety;
- secondly a more torough repair withe the (partly) replacement of the metal beams&nbsp;and the roof cover.

A juridical discussion between the client and ABT is in progress, but at the moment of the entering of the accident details in the system it is still not clear wath the result of this juridical discussion will be.","The fire brigade came on the scene and has taken the following actions/decicions:
- the evacuation perimeter was set to 1,8 kilometers around the site
- the fire was fought by distributing the pile of product by wheel loaders. When this action proved to be not effective, the smouldering fire was extinguished by throwing&nbsp;large amounts of water on the pile of product
- part of the product mixed with the fire water was collected in the internal sewer system and the dirty water tank. This part of the spill was processed by the company itself in the internal waste water treatment
- the firewater which flowed into the dock was dammed with an oil boom and (partly) removed from the water by a specialized company","Some measures and action values were adapted after the incident. More specific were following actions foreseen:
- warning phase smouldering fire is induced when:

temperature smoke is higher than 30°C and the concentration of SO2 is higher than 1 ppm
the action according to this phase induces an announcement to the hierarchy of the company
if necessary fire control is asked by the fire brigade&nbsp;

- the fire brigade is contacted with the message of a smoulder fire when:

the concentration of SO2 exceeds 1,5 ppm OR the concentration of H2S exceeds 4 ppm AND there is smoke AND there is a higher temperature in the piles of product
there are flames and glimmer seen from the pile of product

- the phase of smoulder is ended when the temperature of the pile of product is lower than 30 °C AND the concentration of H2S is lower than 4 ppm AND the concentration of SO2 is lower than 1,5 ppm AND there isn't any smoke anymore
- the phase of smoulder is ended definitely when the temperatures and the gas values are below the threshold values for a period of more than 24 hours."

948,614,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire and explosions caused by leakage of high octane gasoline in the pumping room,1999-08-25 05:35:00,1999-08-25 07:50:00,"The accident occurred in the pump room during the transfer of high octane gasoline from the storage tank TK209 with 6900 m3 capacity, which is part of the on-site storage installation subject to manufacturers tax, to the public storage installation offsite the refinery, downstream of the meters installed by the Italian financial police (Technical Office for Excise Tax) for the payment of the tax&nbsp; due by law.At 5:30 hrs the personnel onsite noticed a large gasoline jet originating from the area near the pump which had been switched on for the transfer operations. Consequent to this the plant managers and the blending department manager were alerted. Emergency response operations were started, as confirmed by several operators in the establishment (transfer operator, emergency crew etc.). During the emergency response operations the spilled gasoline ignited, causing a widespread fire affecting the pump room, the adjacent pipe-ways and pipe-racks, the motor spirit tanks TK231 and TK232 with a capacity of 1000 m3 each and tank TK126 with a capacity of 39300 m3 containing fuel oil. Following the development of the fire some explosions occurred (rupture of several pipes, which were part of the pipe racks, and explosion in the adjoining electrical substation.","The release may have been caused by a spillage through defective joints or a pump or via pipe rupture; a human error linked to incorrect maintenance or wrong operations performed during or immediately before the transfer of the gasoline cannot be excluded as the cause of the accident.The competent authorities (State Attorney's office of Ancona, etc.)&nbsp; is carrying out the investigation into the causes of the accident.","During the first phases of the accident two refinery employees were severely burnt (the plant manger on duty and the shift manager of the product handling department), who were part of the emergency response team. The two employees were transported to two specialised clinics in Rome and Cesena. Due to the extreme severity of the burns unfortunately both died in the following days. Concerning material damage the whole pump room and several transfer pipe sections were completely destroyed. Both tanks TK231 and TK232 were severely damaged in the upper section, while tank TK326 showed damages in its external coating. In the electrical substation a partition wall collapsed, while the other walls were fissured and electrical appliances were damaged. Damage due to the fire was also found in the roofs of the nearest diesel loading platforms. As a precautionary measure the prefect ordered the interruption of traffic on the ""Flaminia"" main road running along the refinery and the Ancona - Bologna railway running through the establishment. The activity of the nearby Raffaello-Sanzio airport was interrupted, both because the fire combustion cloud could have affected the landing and take-off paths of the airplanes and because the airport fire fighters were participating in the emergency response operations at the refinery with specialised equipment taken from the airport.The cloud caused by the fire, containing hydrocarbon combustion products was seen by the population of Falconara. The explosions consequent to the fire were heard by a part of the population of Falconara Marittima, which is located at a certain distance from the refinery.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","The onsite emergency plan was set off. The off-site competent authorities were alerted. The off-site emergency plan was set off by the prefecture of Ancona. Concerning the off-site emergency plan it can be noted that its activation had mainly a precautionary purpose, because the impact area of the accident did not affect, according to evidence, either the railway line (during the first phase of the accident before train circulation had been stopped two trains had passed), or the Flaminia road adjacent to the establishment.As a precautionary measure the military authority ordered the evacuation of barracks located near the establishment.The roofs of tanks TK231 and TK232, affected by the fire, were kept safe under a protective layer of extinguishing foam deposited on top of the roofs after the fire had been extinguished Emergency measures - Remarks: Concerning the emergency measures taken off-site, the population was alerted (ref 7302) over a loudspeaker system, installed in adequate locations in the town of Falconara, by the municipality of Falconara in common agreement with the establishment specifically for emergencies occurring in the refinery.
The measures still necessary at the time of the inspection consisted substantially in maintaining a cover of extinguishing foam on the roofs of the storage tanks involved in the fire (see short report).
Official action taken - legal action: An investigation is being carried out by the State Attorneys Office. The judicial seizure of the equipment and plants involved in the accident was ordered.Official action taken - other official action: Following the accident a special meeting of the competent regional technical committee was organised as foreseen by decrees implementing the Seveso Directive in Italian law.  During the meeting, after having evaluated the gravity of the accident, a series of safety measures to be adopted by the establishment in the short and medium term were identified. These included the delocalisation of the gasoline storage tanks nearest to the railway track and the public roads towards the area near the shore.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Concerning points C and D, it has
been decided to maintain the default indication NO. This choice has
been made because an official inspection ordered by the Minister of the
Environment (in compliance with art 18 of Directive 96/82/EU) is being
carried out with the specific goal to verify the implementation by the
establishment management of the Safety Management System with regards
to the prevention of major accidents. During the follow up of to the
inspection it will be mandatory to consider the consequences of the
accident that occurred. This will also be the appropriate seat to
evaluate the adequacy of the measures taken concerning points c) an d).","Immediate lessons: Considering the accident dynamics causing the death of two refinery employees, who were also members of the refinery emergency response team, and considering the assumptions made with respect to the causes of the accident, it is reasonable to expect that maintenance and operating procedures of the installations have to be reviewed and that training of the operators in charge of these operations has to be improved."

In the early hours of 7th August 2012 approximately 12 tonnes of 50% formaldehyde solution was lost to secondary and tertiary containment over approximately 2 hours from a leaking transfer pump. Some of the material was automatically pumped over to the effluent plant before the leak was discovered. ,"IMMEDIATE CAUSES: 1. Loss of corroded carbon steel drain plug from transfer pump casing. Plug should have been stainless steel.2. Duration of release (and hence quantity) extended to over 2 hours because of inappropriate response (no action) to 2 alarms on DCS system which were accepted by the operator with no follow up response).
UNDERLYING CAUSES:1. Maintenance error - fitting of incompatible drain plug at some point in the past. Maintenance records show that the plug has not been removed from the pump since 2000, but service history is not available prior to this date due to a change in the site's maintenance management software.2. On 6th August 2012 (the day before the incident) the pump was inspected by the Senior Process Technician and an Engineer who suspected a small leak from the pumps seal (no visible leak but a smell of formaldehyde). A new pump seal was ordered for replacement at the next opportunity. The pump was left in service pending this repair.3. This COMAH Major Accident scenario (LOC from transfer pipe work or pumps) was not identified in the Safety Report. Effective preventive and mitigation measures for this particular scenario had not been assessed nor implemented.","This incident constitutes an EC reportable COMAH major accident. There were no injuries and apparently no environmental damage as a result of the Loss of containment.
Investigation completed. Improvement Notice served and other issues to be followed up in the Safety Report Assessment outcome.",The emergency response and clean up operation functioned well apart from the fact that it was not initiated until 2 hours after the leak started.,"The root cause of this incident lies in the predictive section of the safety report. A flawed hazard screening methodology excluded this and similar scenarios (LOC from pipe work and pumps) from the representative set, so no specific prevention and control measures had been assessed or implemented."

Given the succession of accidents arising over the previous few months in the chemical and petroleum industries, combined with the pipeline transport of hazardous substances, a meeting was organised in September 2009 to discuss industrial safety challenges and environmental protection between the Secretary of State for Ecology and industry leaders in these sectors. The industry delegation submitted proposals for improving the safety of their facilities, led by enhanced ageing controls on installations and their maintenance, while committing to greater focus on sensitive ecological zones in order to improve species protection and preservation zones."

Moreover, certain amounts of dry p-NA penetrated into the suction pipe and formed deposits inside it. Consequent to the formation of NO2 during diazotation, the incrustations on the steam pipe and in the exhaust system were transformed into a more reactive product.
Tests have shown that exposing solidified p-NA surfaces (having a  similar consistency of p-NA incrustations) to NO2 gas, leads to the formation of an extremely reactive product.
On 11/05/00 a fire occurred in a dyes synthesis plant.In the plant in question, p-nitroaniline (p-NA) is diazotated. The diazotation reaction occurs in an iced hydrous solution, sodium nitrite (in hydrous solution) and hydrochloric acid (34%) are used as diazotation agents. During the diazotation reaction, nitrous gases are released and sent, together with the hydrochloric acid vapours, to the alkaline absorption through a piping system.During the start-up operations of the apparatus for a new synthesis process, an empty container (18,5 m3)&nbsp; had to be cleaned with pre-heated water added with a sodium hydroxide solution (approx. 200 l).After filling the container to approximately 2/3 of its volume, low pressure vapour was blown into the container by opening a manual valve. The steam is fed through a pipe directly into the cleaning solution. The liquid phase as well as the pipe-walls which are not covered by the liquid heat up, temperatures expected are around 100°C.A few minutes after&nbsp; the steam feeding started, the operator observed the appearance of a flame which moved towards the suction opening. Shortly afterwards (a few minutes), flames accompanied by detonating sounds appeared in the suction pipe. Immediately after, the suction pipe completely burnt with a flash-like fire.&nbsp; The operator declared, moreover, that during diazotation reaction large amounts of nitric oxides are released and that during the last 10 start-ups large amounts of dust occurred during dosage because of the use of dry p-NA. Dust was aspirated and penetrated into the suction system.",1.000.000 EURO material damage,"2 Fire brigade teams came to the scene of the accident, flammable material in proximity to the fire was protected  by means of refrigeration with water and was maintained wet, the electric supply was switched off, the channel system conveying water from the Rhine was shut off.
The contaminants were disposed of properly.","Pimary measures:Exhaust air system: Prevent the formation of dust by using moist anilins. Installation of separate exhaust systems in order to avoid the contact between deposits and NOx. Continuous monitoring and cleaning. Installation of spraying nozzles at the socket of the suction pipe for dust abatement. Inhibition of the deposit reactivity by moistening/washing.Diazotation reactor: prevent the formation of deposits/incrustations by flushing of the reactor wall and the reactor internals.Secondary measures:Exhaust air system: Signal/detect exothermic reactions by installing temperature-sensors in critical areas. Flooding of the piping system at a threshold temperature by means of an automatic/manual release. Prevent exhaust air ventilators from being potential ignition sources (avoid spark formation, arrange driving motors outside the exhaust air system).Diazotation reactor: Prevent heating of surfaces by temperature-monitoring of the shaft of the stirrer; insert the steam pipe horizontally under the surface of the liquid; use a double walled pipe as steam pipe .Unequivocal and restrictive regulations concerning maintenance-, cleaning- and other operations.Tertiary measures:The following measures are intended to avoid/limit the fire&nbsp; propagation in the suction system:- internal extinguishing system automatically activarted by&nbsp; a temperature sensor- linked to an automatic fan switch-off- use ofcertified&nbsp; inflammable or fire resistant materials for the piping and the adsorber equipment- use of automatically closing fire dampers- installation of the vertical exhaust air duct on the external wall of the building (exhaust air ducts should not pass through firewalls)- installation of spray nozzles in vertical pipes - consider eventual waterloads in structural calculations"

ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
The atmospheric tank T-837, storing atmospheric residue, was completely destroyed by a vertical fracture on 6 (out of the 10) plates of the shell. The fracture was from the lower side of the shell towards to its higher and then continued horizontally from a side to the other. The bottom ruptured in the transition zone of the welding to the shell. The wave of the escaping liquid from storage tank T-837 destroyed the nearby tanks T-827 and T-836 (with the same capacity of tank T-837 but filled with atmospheric residue only at a level of 1m [about 600 m3]). Besides, the tank T-826, storing 10,000 m3 of liquid and located in  the same basin with the three others, was seriously damaged. Spilled hydrocarbons overflowed the tanks dike and spread over an area of 8 hectares (80,000 m2) causing the rupture of many pipes (in heavy residue, steam and gasoil service) and the displacement without rupture of pipes in gas service (two of ethylene, one of vinyl chloride), but no fire developped.","CAUSES:The causes of the accident have not yet been clarified. The hypotheses that have been excluded during the investigations were:- operator error (taking into account the examination of the instrument registrations);- massive evaporation of water that could have been used erroneously instead of the cooling oil in the tank;- explosion even if nobody inside or outside the establishment heard the noise of an explosion;- terrorist attack.The hypotheses remained under investigation were:- malfunction of the atmospheric distillation column causing the production of an atmospheric residue with a density different from that of the product already stored, causing stratification and subsequent roll-over;- rupture of the shell due to an excessive hydrostatic pressure caused by overfilling (by about 2m above the normal high operating level [19.6m]).","MATERIAL LOSS:Two storage tanks were destroyed and one damaged by the wave of the escaping liquid from the tank fractured. Besides, spilled hydrocarbons overflowed the tanks dike and spread over an area of 8 hectares (80,000 m2) causing the rupture of many pipes (in heavy residue, steam and gasoil service) and the displacement without rupture of pipes in gas service (two of ethylene, one of vinyl chloride).

Probably because of the failure of the cooling system of the epichlorhydrine reactor, the polymerization heat (not removed) caused a pressure increase that led to an explosion inside the vessel. The underlying causes that led to the accident were, both, inadequate process analysis (code 5307) and system design (code 5308)."," EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:
Inside the establishment 1 person was injured (and hospitalized) by the
explosion.
MATERIAL LOSS:
The epichlorhydrine production plant was completely destroyed. Outside
the establishment the windows' glasses of the nearby houses were
ruptured due to the shock wave generated by the explosion. No data are
available about the cost of the material damages.
The main problem after the incident were the large amounts of white
asbestos scattered around and outside the establishment. Sufficiently
protected fire brigade personnel took care of the removal of the
asbestos on the days immediately after the explosion.(1) the fire water
was contaminated with gasoline due to violation of procedures
(back-flow through a nose, connecting a hydrant and a drum) (2) no
safety advicxe during contract negotiations for renting the mobile
pumpThe Internal Emergency Plan was activated (code 7100). Gaz de
France put in operation the safety resources (personnel and materials
[code 7201]) available at Beynes (Yvelines). The release was halted
with the assistance of a specialized contractor (code 7205) called in
by the manufacturer, who covered the escape source with sludge and
brought the bar to its original position by increasing the loading on
it (code 7501). The External Emergency Plan was activated and the
Authorities were alerted (code 7200). The Fire Brigade was mobilized
but its intervention was not necessary (code 7201). The Police (code

The manhole is located at the bottom part of the silos. The workers used steel wrencheslevers to unbolt the eyebolts of the hinged manhole cover and to open it then outwards.Some product (Pentaerythrite) fell on the ground when the manhole cover was opened taking fire and eventually causing a first explosion. As a consequence further product slid down from the silo, and was dispersed in the air by the ventilators placed under the silo, the air Pentaerythrite mixture ignited explosively (dust explosion).The product released from the silo was either constituted by residues adhering on the silos walls or residues accumulated on the manhole cover before opening.During the occurrence one worker was injured fatally and two injured worker needed stationary treatment.The triggering event of the accident was the release of Pentaerythrite from the manhole of the silos, which was opened for inspection. The dust ignited at an up to now unidentified ignition source.","Triggering event/accident dynamics: The triggering event of the accident was a release of Pentaerythrite from the manhole of the silos, which was opened for inspection works.

965,37,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Releas of hydrofluoric acid during maintenance in a alkylation unit,2002-11-10 16:00:00,2002-11-10 16:01:00,"The alkylation unit was going into shut down. Two contractors were fixing a copper tube to a T-piece of a drain. During the work they turned the T-piece over 90°. Due to this fact a valve on the T-piece was opened and an amount of HF was released. One of the contractors was very seriously wounded, while the other person was only lightly wounded.","Because the alkylation unit was shut down, the biggest equipment was already emptied and the installation was cleaned with nitrogen. Then it was decided to drain the unit to remove all fluids left. The drain consisted of two valves and a blind flange. The blind flange was removed and replaced by a T-piece consisting of a manometer and a small valve. The T-piece was mounted in a horizontal way. A permit was written for two contractors to add a copper tube to the small valve on the T-piece. Because it was not easy to work with the T-piece mounted horizontally they decided to rotate the T-piece. While rotating the piece, the handle of the small valve touched a pipeline and the valve opened and 360ml HF was released. This amount of HF was situated between the two large valves and the small valve on the T-piece.","One of the contractors was very seriously injured. His eyes, nose and mouth were burned and he inhalated HF fumes, which caused internal injuries. The second person only had small injuries around his mouth. ",On-site the victim was given an antidotum (calciumgluconate) and an ambulance brought both victims to a hospital specialised in treating burn injuries. ,"Not allowed to make changes on the systems of the refinery. The T-piece on the drain was a temporary piece only
installed for the shutdown. There was no standard in the company to which
temporary pieces had to comply. The T-piece used screw thread which made it
possible to turn the T-piece. The accident showed that a standard for temporary
pieces must be drawn up. In the company it was seen as normal that the manual
valves in the line on which the T-piece was fitted had a small internal leak.
So in the work permit protective clothing should have been specified for
working on this line since they should have anticipated that HF would build up
between the fixed (leaking) valves and the quarter turn valve on the temporary
T-piece. A Quarter turn valve is easily manipulated accidently, certainly while
doing mechanical work in the immediate vicinity. "

After mixing, the final product is temporary stored in a tank. 2) &nbsp; &nbsp;Packaging&nbsp;of the insecticide.The final product is pumped from the temporary storage to the packaging unit. In this unit the insecticide is packed into bottles or cans.","Accident scenario and primary causes :Origins of the accident : industrial waste water with too high concentration of pesticides flew into the river Meuse.&nbsp; Quantity released during the 31th July 2007: ~ 68kg of Chlorpyriphos and ~12 kg of Cypermethrin.Consequence:&nbsp; minimal estimation of fish mortality is 10 to 12 tonnes.Causes : Insecticide release occurred during transfer between temporary storage and packaging unit.This transfer is made with several pipes equipped with manual valves. Depending on their positions, product transfer from temporary storage is made to one of the packaging units. Probably inadvertently, one of the valves was not completely closed on Monday 30th July. During pesticide transfer, a dash of product flowed through a flexible that was suspended above the collection system for waste water. Because of this, no odour and no leaking has been detected at the workplace.&nbsp; Activated carbon filters were rapidly saturated with the pollutants load in used waters. Waste water was not sufficiently purified before release into the river Meuse. Secondary causes :

&nbsp;The person in charge of packaging had noted that 800 litres of product were lacking compared to the client's order. But he didn't imagine that was due to a release. As there is a lack of communication between formulation and packaging teams, the operator assumed that there was less product formulated and he must take the balance from reserve storage.
A homogenisation bowl for waste water is placed after purifying unit; but was bypassed due to works on it.
The TCO meter used to control the quality of waste water before release should have raised an alarm. But this TCO meter was out of order at the time of the accident (capillarity supply was obstructed) and the company did not realize it.
",Consequence : minimal estimation of fish mortality is 10 to 12 tonnes.Affected Area: Affected Area: off-site: localAffected Area: Affected Area: off-site: regionalEcological component: marine or fresh water habitat - Affected Yes,No emergency response,"Actions imposed :

The company must nominate one person who is responsible for waste water management and for compliance of release limits for industrial waste water.
The homogenisation bowl has to be started again immediately.
The company must organize an internal audit about waste water purification.
Measure devices (TCO meters) must be maintained periodically following a defined procedure. An alarm should be raised not only at too high values but also in case of failure (values abnormally low). In case of alarm the purification unit and release into Meuse has to be stopped.
A continuous measurement of waste water quality must be installed.
An electronic transfer of TCO values will be installed between the company and the Environmental Police. In case of river pollution, the Environmental Police will see immediately the data of the purification unit from CHIMAC SA.
Installation of a TCO meter before purification. Knowing the purification capacity of carbon filters, this TCO meter can be used to verify if the pollutant load can be purified.

Complementary actions :
8.&nbsp; &nbsp;A better communication must be established between production units in order to detect anomalies in the pesticide transfer as fast as possible.
Lessons learnedA pesticide production company contains permanent ecological risks. The least lack of vigilance can have very high consequences. There is a need of clear and precise internal procedures. Operators must be perfectly trained and made aware of existing risks. "

The debutanizing column (C-43) should have extracted these gases, which are commonly found in the gas stream in order for them to undergo treatment. Due to insufficient temperature and pressure in this unit, extraction did not occur. The gases accumulated in the petrol tank (2178 C) forming a pocket that spread outside the recipient until an ignition source set off a gas blast. The explosion occured at 8:15 am and displaced the tank's floating roof (2178 C) and began the combustion of the gasoline contained within it (2 400 m3). The fire spread to the other gasoline tanks housed in the same area (C 2) as well as to the outer lying installations. In total, seven storage tanks (8 600 m3 of petrol) were affected, and it took over 48 hours to extinguish the fires. As a result, nine plant workers were killed, and there was serious material damage.","Based on the report issued by the competent authority for industry and work, the major causes have been identified as follows:    Incomplete risk analysis, which did not allow the consequences to be known beforehand of placing a product with a high gas content in an atmospheric tank, which was by its nature unsuitable for such use.   Inadequate everyday work procedures in the FCC unit.   High levels of gas stored in the tanker, which led to the displacement of the tanker's floating roof.    Late detection which allowed the gases to accumulate. Also, a power cut left without power to the collection in which occurred the explosion. Since then, despite the recovery of energy and return to operation, the unit was not yet well balanced. Hence, for a few days occurs the accumulation of gases detached unit (butane and other lighter hydrocarbons) which, in contact with a hot spot, caused its explosion.",Nine workers died.

In the accident about 500 kg was released into the atmosphere in about 2.5 minutes which is actually the maximum permissible emission before the safety device is triggered.,"- Information by DSM to the Regional Alarm Centres: ""Gas leaks that may endanger the&nbsp;&nbsp; population""- Triggering of the application of civil defence program- Dutch defence program did not alarm Dutch population- the near Belgian/Limburg Region started civil defence program that could not be&nbsp; interrupted- Crisis center organized in Hasselt- No indication (measured values) of increased nitrous gases at living level- at 4.00 p.m all warnings cancellation","DMG disassembled the auxiliary control system and the plant operates at a lower pressure. A coupled safety system (interlock) was chosen for the future, because it will automatically trim combustion as soon as the safety device is triggered; blow-down time is thus shortened to about 30 seconds. It should be determined how to report in writing such events to the Province Authorities. It was agreed that the Belgian Authorities would be as soon as possible informed about any unusual events that might lead to trouble, harmful effects or danger in Belgian border region. Prompter information should also timely be given to the province and nearby municipalities. The Authorities will also timely be informed in an explanatory CCo about the DSM protection program to be implemented in case of accidents."
972,1292,Major Accident,Processing of metals using electrolytic or chemical processes,Fire and substance release in a surface treatment plant,2021-09-15 11:15:00,2021-09-15 11:40:00,"While re-filling a treatment basin, an exothermic reaction took place which was followed by a fire.
An adjacent basin was filled with a treatment solution (approx. 1,000 litres in volume) containing the same amount of input substance. The solution is classified as H1 ‘acute toxic’. The basin was damaged by the heat of the fire.
Plant equipment such as PVC pipes were also damaged by the fire.
Safety measures:The fire alarm system in the affected area was triggered and the on-site fire brigade was alerted. At the same time, an evacuation alarm was sounded manually.The on-site fire brigade arrived immediately and initiated firefighting measures in line with the alarm and fire brigade route map.","The input substances (sodium hydroxide (NaOH), metal surface treatment agent, sodium cyanide (NaCN)) were added to the basin in the above order while small amounts of residual rinsing water were still present in the basin.The work instructions in force were therefore not adhered to.This led to an exothermic reaction (heat of dilution) of the NaOH with the residual rinsing water.Because of the layering of the substances added, sufficient heat removal was not possible. An isolated heat island below the NaCN led to the ignition/decomposition of the metal surface treatment agent.Planned simultaneous addition of more de-mineralised water to fill the basin (which, through heat removal, would have prevented a reaction between the NaOH and the residual rinsing water up to ignition point) was not possible because of a defective solenoid valve.
Operating staff deviated from the predefined work instructions in order to make it more feasible to add solids to the basin filled with de-mineralised water and to prevent the vat contents from splashing because of the partially clumped NaCN.","Production facilities:Total loss of production facilities in the fire area.
Building:Total loss of building technology in the fire area.Severe impact on the remaining production facilities and the building, including building technology, due to extremely corrosive smoke.Damage to production facilities and infrastructure due to smoke and heat.","Evacuation of buildings concerned.Staff informed and windows closed.
Firefighting by the fire brigade.The fire was successfully extinguished with CO2 fire extinguishers.
The fire did not pose a threat to groundwater. Entry of substances into the sewage system can likewise be excluded (no use of water); the liquids discharged from the vats were collected within the plant.
Professional fire brigade ready on site (deployment was not necessary).The professional fire brigade’s environmental measurement service was deployed in the residential area around the operating zone.","The workability of all procedures for filling treatment vats in which multiple input substances are used has been checked. Any detected shortcomings in their safe and workable implementation have been eliminated via technical or organisational measures. These include upgrading manual valves for the supply of de-mineralised water, provision of equipment to improve ergonomics and handling of work equipment and substances, and introducing checklists for operating staff in order to safeguard procedures.All corresponding processes then underwent clearance.
A standard for the technical design of basin-filling devices has been defined and implemented.Staff in the production and planning departments have been trained.The measures taken by the operator to secure vat contents and the processes and rules implemented at the company have been verified by external experts approved under Section&nbsp;29b of the Federal Immission Control Act (BImSchG).The potential minor improvements identified have been implemented / are being implemented.
Substances were not dispensed in the order provided for in the existing written work instructions. The result was an exothermic reaction. This shows how important it is to regularly and exhaustively communicate and supervise adherence to work instructions.
The use of a CO2 fire extinguisher (foam extinguishers were available as well) caused a reaction with the NaCN, generating toxic HCN (hydrogen cyanide).This shows that it is necessary to better prepare staff for handling operational malfunctions."

The unit was then used for normal operation and had just been started when an ignition in the electrofilter caused an explosion. This caused a short circuit of the wire connecting gas cooler and E-filter and the upper part of the gas cooler was torn off by the explosion.,"CAUSES:The immediate cause has been identified as faulty operation in the shut-down procedure of the experimental run. The shut-down of the unit did not occur in the right order and, due to the lack of an interlocking device, vacuum occurred when the unit was start-up. Air was sucked in through the waterlock- underpressure safety device to the gas cooler and the wet electrofilter, resulting in an explosion.","MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion caused extensive damages to the plant and, outside the establishment, the windows breakage up to 50 metres from the installation. No data are available about the cost of the material damages.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The explosion caused the windows breakage up to 50 metres from the installation.People - Remarks: No people were injured during the accident.Ecological harm - Remarks: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms.Disruption of community life: The explosion caused the windows breakage up to 50 metres from the installation.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","No emergency measures were necessary, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:After the accident the following measures were established:1- insurance against faulty operation through interlocking device;2- to improve the techniques for measurement and control to avoid formation of low pressure.
974,51,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Explosion of an emergency tank in a nitrobenzene production line due to climatic conditions,2002-12-26 13:47:00,2002-12-26 14:50:00,"Explosion of an emergency tank when the unit was out of operation during winter (from 24.12.2002).The explosion occurred on the adiabatic production line of nitrobenzene during the time when the system was out of operation due to the cold. The site of the explosion was a storage tank, the purpose of which is a safety drainage of supporting medium from the production line. The storage tank contains two phases - acidic (that means sulphuric acid in the concentration of 70-80 %) and organic (nitrobenzene). Both phases normally contain dissolved nitrophenols and dinitrobenzene in concentrations of up to hundreds of mg/kg. The investigation found that the most probable course of events was as follows: The first factor was the climatic conditions, which lead to the freezing of the route of the waste condensate from the technological steam heating, followed by the penetration of the condensate from the overfilled condenser through the barometric closure into the drainage storage tank with the sulphuric acid. Here, as a consequence of the dissolving temperature on the interface of the acid and organic phase, the temperature gradually increased accompanied by other bypassing exothermic reactions (thermal decomposition of less stable nitrophenols and dinitrobenzene). These reactions increased the temperature on the interface up to the decomposition temperature of nitrobenzene. Thermal decomposition of nitrobenzene was accompanied by a rupture of the storage tank - explosion. An investigation team was appointed in accordance with the operational guidelines of BC MCHZ - Instruction M2 - 26150.doc ""Investigation of extraordinary events"". Results of the investigation are summarized in the report ""Accident of the adiabetic line of the production plant of nitrobenzene"" event.No.1/2003/VS3 from 27.1.2003. Following the comments to A1.Immediately after the explosion, the JHZS BC MCHZ arrived on the scene, followed by other components of IZS. At the same time, the instruction was issued to close the terminal of the rain collector that drains the water to the Odra (remote controlled armature). Information from other interested persons, including technical steps, followed in accordance with the internal emergency plan of BC MCHZ. The explosion of the storage tank in the bottom part of the steel panel construction of the adiabatic line caused damage to the technological constructions of the line in the floors above. There was no fire during the explosion and nobody was injured. The liquid content of the storage tank, partially also in the form of explosion products, was sent flying and most of the liquid phase landed in the retention tank under the line, while a small part fell on the consolidated road, and approx. 1m3 fell on the surrounding snow. The liquid phase froze on the road and snow, and it was possible to clean it up after mixing with sawdust. The contaminated material was deposited on a protected surface in the area BC MCHZ. At the same time an aerosol cloud composed from soot and fine drops of acids formed. Most of the aerosol sedimented in the inner part of the area, while a part was blown to the south and southwest of the plant. The aerosol also hit a high-tension cable- inlet insulators to BC MCHZ, and made them scintillate. They had to be cleaned, leading to a temporary cut in the supply of electricity. Debris was spread up to 90m with one piece (a tube) being found at a distance of 300 m - on the opposite bank of the Odra river. The pressure wave broke windows in the surroundings and damaged the guttering of roofs of the neighbouring objects. ","It is impossible to differentiate the main course of events, causes and accompanying events of the accident.Complex of simultaneous unexpected impact of factors, which - if they do not occur together - cannot cause an accident.","Escape mainly to the protection sump and to the consolidated road surface, a smaller amount (approx. 1 m3 ) out - froze on the snow surfaceMaterial loss:The given values represent preliminary damage estimated (verified by insurance company) with the condition that it is accountable monthly from the establishment remediation. The damage of 117 millions Kc is constructed from the estimation of the cost of the reconstruction of the establishment (approx. 92 millions Kc) and 25 millions Kc as so called direct damage (remediation, demolition, minor repairs). Accounting regulations do not permit further differentiation.Damage beyond the plant includes compensation for a show-window damaged by pressure wave and compensation for two jackets damaged by fine acid aerosol.Affected Area: Affected Area: installationAffected Area: Affected Area: establishment",Action was fully in accordance with VHP,"Measures to prevent recurrence: a) Measures adopted so that this type of serious accident could not repeat

The fire fighting system for the ACH tanks is based on a foaming substance which is conveyed by water of the fire fighting network in the ACH tank at a level close to the bottom. The ejector system is sited in a little well with losing bottom. In case of fire inside the ATC tank the mixture of foam and water is introduced in the tank. The water pressure broke two Teflon membranes having the function to separate the ATC from the water of firefighting system. It is to supposed that 
phenomena of aging together with a non perfect clamping of ejector's parts have caused the leak (material degradation, fatigue). Such leak spread successively from the ejector well (which was losing) to the ground.",There were no effects on human health. It was involved the superficial water-bearing stratum. The Local Sanitary Unit and the PMP (Prevention Multizonal Garrison) are going on with daily tests over 25 wells. It is involved the superficial water-bearing stratum (5-8 m) but not the first water-bearing stratum (30 m) due to the presence of an impermeable clay stratum. The water-bearing stratum from which the drinking water is withdrawn is at 60 m then is still more protected. However the pollution of the superficial water-bearing is very high and it is necessary to continue in the future to verify that the deeper strata are not involved. This problem is emphasized in the ordinance of the Mayor of the city.,"The mayor issued ordinances in date 94 09 16, 94 09 23, 94 10 13 and 94 12 05. Such ordinances oblige the ATOCHEM Company to:- carry on studies on the morphology and permeability of the clay stratum and on the flow behaviour of the superficial water-bearing stratum;- realize a mechanical barrage and a hydraulic barrage, with purifying system of the withdrawn water;- install some piezometer for the control of the first and the second water-bearing stratum;- study solutions to permit the oxidation on site. Moreover the mayor authorized the ATOCHEM to transfer the polluted water withdrawn from underground by the pumps of the hydraulic barrage (toxic waste) for their provisional storing nearby the ""Italiana Petroli"" company. The mayor authorized also the provisional storing nearby the ATOCHEM through the installation of a containment basin. He has obliged also the ATOCHEM to daily measure, by the piezometers, the concentration of acetone, free cyanides, total cyanides and ACH. Finally the mayor asked the ATOCHEM to give an exact evaluation of the released ACH. ATOCHEM has prepared a reclaim plan based on the prosecution of the ACH squeezingoperation from the water-bearing stratum and on the continuous water emission in the pouring point and in the well No.2, with squeezing in the downstream wells 9, 10 and 12, up to values near to 0. Analysis of the ground and following treatment of the same are foreseen. On February 28 1995 the mayor authorized the Elf ATOCHEM to reclaim the area, following its plan. He promoted a technical-scientific committee to direct the reclaim. The committee which is composed of technicians of the USLL 68 and 69 will give the results of his work(as soon as they will be available) to the European Commission.",not given
976,1289,Major Accident,Chemical installations ,Fire in an alcoholates factory,2021-08-07 23:50:00,2021-08-08 05:45:00,"At 23:32&nbsp;hrs on 7&nbsp;August 2021, a fire broke out in an alcoholates factory’s extraction system.A defective overflow sensor caused the supply of salt water to sodium (Na) electrolysis cells to be suspended and the cells were shut down.The hydrogen/chlorine mixture resulting from the process was sucked into the waste gas system.The rapid shutdown of a large number of Na cells caused significant flow variations. This led to a short circuit in a potassium electrolysis cell in production at that time.The hydrogen/chlorine mixture produced during the short circuit was ignited.
After the plant’s emergency shutdown, this cell was also switched to the common waste gas system, causing the flammable hydrogen/chloro mixture already present in the waste gas system to re-ignite.
Safety functions:A faulty reading from an overflow safety device suspended the supply of salt water to the cells. If the supply of salt water is suspended, the cells must be shut down. In the process, the valve to the waste gas flow path is opened. This also worked.
In the event of a short circuit, a cell is shut down and the valve to the waste gas flow path is likewise opened. This also proceeded as planned.
A short circuit in a cell is a pre-designed scenario that is controlled by safety-oriented measures and one that has already occurred in rare cases. The overflow safety device is operationally tested and previous cases have been reported of process control faults in the overflow safety device. A simultaneous short circuit and process control failure in an overflow safety device with the ensuing sequence of events described above was hitherto unknown.
The pressure drop in the common waste gas system ensured that damage to the waste gas pipes did not lead to the release of other substances contained in the waste gas, but to ambient air being sucked into the waste gas system instead. This explains the low levels of substances released.
The mitigation and security actions taken immediately after the incident occurred ran as expected:Plant fire service alerted and briefed on arrival, fire extinguished with quenching water, quenching water retained, fire watch after fire had been extinguished.
No further actions, such as rescue efforts, paramedical intervention, warnings in surrounding areas, evacuation, etc., were necessary.","Damage to the rubber coating on the overflow sensor’s detector caused the detector to corrode and emit faulty readings.The failure of multiple electrolysis cells caused variations in pressure.This caused denting in a cellular sheet, agitating the surface of the liquid in the working cell. The liquid’s subsequent wave motion led to a short circuit in that cell.","Damage to equipment, pipes, parts of the building. Costs: EUR&nbsp;19,600,000","Inside the operating area: plant fire service called out, quenching water used in order to fight the fire.No actions required outside the operating area.
Repairs to equipment and parts of the building damaged by the fire.&nbsp;
Quenching water (contaminated with mercury) was retained and fed into an enabled storage basin in the waste water treatment plant.Waste water in the basement was pumped into containers and tank wagons, and brought to the company’s waste water treatment plant.","
Redesign the waste gas system in flue ducts with more than 4 cells, upgrading it in size to provide significantly greater reserve capacity.
Fit smaller openings to the flush nozzles of the flue duct on the individual cells and factor these into the flue system’s redesign.
In the event of multiple cell failures within a short time (a few minutes), disable the power supply to all cells automatically.
Flue ducts to be made of conductive glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP). No polyethylene (PE) inliner is needed.
By diverting the mercury flow, hydrogen only develops in the cell for a very short period when it is shut down. Reduce the total volume of hydrogen produced when the cell is shut down by limiting the concentration of sodium or potassium in the respective cell intake. These measures dramatically reduce the overall amount of hydrogen which develops.
An alarm will replace the stand-by system implemented for quality reasons on the salt water intake to the cells.
A status circuit which shuts down the plant will be fitted to the pure salt water container.

An ignition of explosive residues was triggered by the heat and/or friction caused by cutting operations, the explosion caused the destruction of the pipe being cut and the rupture and fragmentation of a cutting disk.Description of the event:It was foreseen to install a new water pipe for a refrigeration plant in a machine room. The work was performed in the machine shop, where at time of the occurrence a worker was present.At 11:28 h a loud bang occurred, which was heard by a collaborator (having&nbsp; his office in the same building in which the explosion occurred. The collaborator left his office and noticed a broken window in the machine shop. Opening the door of the machine shop he noticed thick dust which progressively deposited on the ground. Further he noticed a strong hiss caused by air released from a damaged pressure pipe. The collaborator alerted directly the onsite emergency response services and the management of the company.The collaborator in the machine shop was found lying with his back on the ground and the feet towards the working bench, he presented injuries in correspondence to the head, the inguinal area and the left arm. A pipe on which cutting work had been performed was found between his legs. The pipe in question was a 80 cm DN-40 pipe, with flanges at both ends and a short DN-15 branch pipe. The pipe presents serious damages whereas the DN-15 pipe was completely ripped off.The immediately alerted emergency response service could only establish the death f the collaborator. The death had been caused by a splinter which had entered in the head of the collaborator. A exiting wound was found on the skull of the collaborator.A report on the cause of the accident suggests that abrasive cutting work was being performed on a pipe which was contaminated with the explosive nitropenta. It is suspected that a pipe from the processing plant was used contrary to instructions. This pipe had not been disposed of on the fire and detonation site as stipulated.

978,1043,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) leak at foam production plant,2012-08-13 12:43:00,2012-08-13 06:45:00,"At approximately 07:00 in the foam production area, a TDI pipeline (in the cooling system) connected to a heat exchanger (plate-fin heat exchanger) was opened.
After the circuit had been running for approximately 15 minutes, a pressure relief valve was activated and fluid (cooling water) was released.
The TDI circuit pump was shut down and the TDI pipeline to the heat exchanger was closed off. Initial troubleshooting by staff. From approx. 08:30 supported by specialist firm which carried out the installation. The cause was identified as using the wrong pipelines. When the heat exchanger was fitted the product inlet (TDI) and the cooling water outlet from the heat exchanger were mixed up.
This resulted in a short-circuit between the coolant (ethylene glycol/water) and the product (TDI). At that point it was not apparent that coolant had entered the TDI tank. It was not possible to foresee the subsequent effects of this. At approx. 11:30 the operating crew noticed that steam was coming out of the tank storage facility. They then inspected the tank storage facility and found that the steam was coming out of one TDI tank and that the tank had a raised temperature.
The production management then immediately informed the company management. In addition, the production manager at a subsidiary site and the European Isocyanate Producers Association (ISOPA) emergency call centre were contacted for advice.
The steam generation in the tank section of the storage hall had now become stronger and the temperature and pressure in the tank continued to rise. It could also be seen that material (liquid and foam) and steam were being released from the tank as gas escaped.
Since it could no longer be ruled out that gas could also be released outside the tank storage building, at approx. 12:43 the operating crew called the public fire service.
At approx. 13:00 the first members of the public fire service, police and rescue service arrived at the site. The public fire service was assisted by two works fire brigade units on site.
At approx. 13:15 the competent authorities and the appointed external accident coordinator were also informed by the company management.
Side by side with the emergency services deployed at the accident site, an emergency and crisis management team was set up in the administration building on 13 August 2013 for internal risk protection and emergency management. The team was made up of company operations managers, the accident coordinator, external emergency services and representatives of the authorities. Since the TDI contents of the damaged tank continued to display an exothermic reaction and thermal instability, to reduce the heat of the reaction the tank and the entire TDI tank storage building were permanently kept under a water curtain by the emergency services. Following the installation of various additional temperature-measuring devices, the reaction in the damaged tank could be measured and monitored, inside the tank and on its outer wall continuously by the emergency services in a safe room.
The TDI tank affected had a double wall, which meant that the water curtain had only a small heat-dissipating effect. As described, the tank had to be cooled for several days by spraying (water curtain). Following the provisional all-clear on 16 August 2012, on 17 August 2012 the temperature rose again significantly, possibly as a result of the reduced spraying. The situation did not stabilise until 18/19 August 2012 as a result of the sustained cooling. To be safe, the public emergency response services continued cooling by spraying (water curtain) until it was clear from the temperature readings that the reaction had stopped. The investigation and clean-up work could then begin. The damaged TDI tank was inspected by specially trained fire service staff and other experts at the end of August 2013. The purpose of the inspection was to obtain a better assessment of the residual risk for salvaging the damaged tank and as a result determine the subsequent recovery procedure.
Following a thorough examination, by agreement with the company operations managers, the local emergency services and representatives of the authorities, the tank and its remaining contents were disposed of safely with the aid of a specialised firm in September 2013 using a special industrial cleaning method (suction method). At the same time the expert appointed by the investigating authority began investigating the cause in accordance with § 29a BImSchG (Federal Immission Control Act).","The cause is human error (repair work):
Preparatory work for starting up a TDI cooling water system by staff (13 August 2012) following conversion work. When a plate-fin heat exchanger was fitted, the pipelines were mixed up. start up
As a result, on start-up water was able to enter a raw material tank. The ingress of water (heat transfer medium in the heat exchanger: ethylene glycol/water mixture) triggered a chemical reaction, leading to an increase in temperature and pressure in the affected tank.","- Damage to tank,
- Contaminated TDI, approximately 20 t. Cost: EUR 100 000","At approx. 07:00 the inlet and return valves of the production pipeline were opened and the TDI circulated (preparatory work for starting up the TDI cooling water system).
At approx. 07:15 the pressure relief valve in the cooling water circuit activates. Cooling water is allowed to drain.
From approx. 07:15 staff look for fault.
From approx. 08:30 support from outside firm. Cause of fault: mix-up in pipelines. Water ingress into TDI tank not apparent.
At approx. 11:30 steam generated in TDI store. Operating crew check TDI store. Company management informed immediately. Production manager at a subsidiary site and the ISOPA emergency call centre contacted for advice.
At approx. 12:43 emergency call to fire service because increased steam generation visible.
At approx. 13:00 first emergency service staff arrive on site. Emergency service staff immediately take the appropriate safety measures: water curtain outside (building), tank, i.e. tank walls, cooled from outside (also by spraying), danger areas sealed off, public alerted by police loudspeaker messages, radio announcements (‘Please stay indoors and keep doors and windows closed’).
At approx. 13:15 competent authorities and appointed external accident coordinator informed by company management. - The company (workshop management) made an emergency call to the fire brigade,
- Members of staff at the plant were evacuated in accordance with the emergency plan and proceeded to the assembly point,
- Fire brigade and other emergency services (police) attended the scene,
- Emergency services set up a water curtain (building),
- Tank, i.e. tank walls, cooled from outside (also by spraying), - Danger areas sealed off,
- Local residents alerted by police loudspeaker messages, radio announcements,
- Nearby facilities at plant secured (building and separation/decoupling of nearby components (equipment/pipelines),
- Immediate notification sent to competent authority, - Information sheet produced and distributed to local residents,
- Measurements (atmospheric measurements) taken by fire brigade,
- Network of approximately 25 technical experts and consultants set up on-site in order to develop essential safety measures further (including additional cooling of damaged tank, tank recovery, securing neighbouring components, official information, etc.).","Technical measures:
- Measuring and control equipment: to protect employees in the event of an incident a large number of measuring and control devices were installed, e.g. pressure monitors, temperature monitors, overfill protectors, filling level monitors, water monitors, TDI sensors, etc.
- Marking of TDI pipelines and storage tanks: all TDI pipelines and storage tanks were colour-coded. The suction and pressure lines on TDI pumps were marked in different colours. Signs were also put up with the substance names and flow direction.
- Installation of a TDI monitor which gives an acoustic and optical alarm on site if a limit value of 0.5 ppb is exceeded.
- Reduction of the TDI storage capacity.
- Replacement of the traditional heat exchanger with a safety heat exchanger. This ensures that no coolant comes into contact with TDI or enters the TDI circuit, and that no TDI enters the cooling circuit. Organisational measures:
- Setting up of an emergency service (alarm system sends text message to mobile phone).
- Review of the plant alarm and contingency plan and introduction of a local incident commander.
- Review of operating instructions, such as conduct in the event of an alarm in the TDI part of the plant, operating instructions for the organisation of the emergency service, goods-in checks and unloading TDI tankers, operating instructions for the TDI monitors, instructions for outside firms.
- Review of and training in the ‘work permit’ procedure: for work involving particular risks, such as working at height, working with hazardous substances, etc. a work permit must be issued and all the necessary data documented.
- Review of the inspection and maintenance plan: drawing up an inspection register with all routine inspections. As a precautionary measure to limit the effect of incidents, a number of technical and organisational measures were laid down and implemented. Other measures included adding a systematic incident assessment to the safety report. A total of three incident assessments were drawn up.
The incident assessments will be routinely reviewed."

The roof of the storage tank flew away and landed about 100 metres further.","Human error: even though the employees knew in general that the cleaning of the tank could be dangerous, they did not check if there were special dangers involved in the cleaning of this specific tank. It was a routine job. Even though they could have known that the concentration of the MTBE was above the upper explosion limit (UEL), they opened the manhole while the vacuum pump was working. Because of the open manhole the concentration of the MTBE decreased. The concentration was lower than the UEL. Most probably the vacuum pump has caused the ignition and the explosion.At the preparing of the cleaning job with a high pressure water rotary jet (400 bar), there has been no specific safety analysis carried out. The high pressure rotary jetting is known to accumulate electrostatic electricity. In an atmosphere of combustible mixture it caused an explosion. There were no such risk/danger mentioned on the safety work permit.

Due to the explosion two employees died and five received ambulatory cares. According to the current alarm procedure the plant was evacuated and the fire brigade advised.","The cause of the primary explosion is the failure of the worm gear feeder (material fatigue, material rupture) or a foreign body in the worm gear feeder. It is supposed that the second explosion in the packing room was triggered in that way that the pressure wave has torn out with force the steel plate in the input of the transport tunnel and this has torn out the l'imbuto engine which was 50% filled (12-15kg) and led to detonation.

Its contents, 450 m# of phosphoric acid) spread out in waves in the reinforced-concrete retention basin, destroying it. There was no significant impact on the environment, given the nature of the substance.","There was a combination of material failures (the state of the vessel) and failure to apply site procedures strictly.
State of the vessel: inspectors had required a check of the vessel's thickness. Such a check would have shown a reduction of thickness of one collar and 4/5 of the height of the vessel. However these failures were only noticed after the accident.
The reduction in thickness was due to a leak in the lead lining which had allowed the carbon steel, the load-bearing part of the wall, to be corroded.
","The vessel and the retention basin were destroyed. It is not proposed to reconstruct the vessel: a different one will be used.
There were no major effects on the environment: the closure of the valve isolating the site sewers meant that the river was not polluted. Natural phosphate was distributed to neutralise the phosphoric acid, and the resultant compounds were used on site, since they are already in use in the process.
The consequences on the subsoil, however, are still under study.
","Another container was brought into use and the installations affected were checked and cleaned. The sewer network was pumped out several times, cleaned, and put back into service.","The accident was presented to the teams, and they were reminded of the procedures requiring the comments of the inspection service to be taken into account."

The smaller quantities of acid were used to correct the reaction and the amount of carbonates in the chemical mixture. Essential quantities of nitric acid (as raw material) are being pumped to the reactors from the storage tanks. The worker loaded an empty container on a fork-lift truck and drove to the storage tanks located 200 m from the installation. After filling the container and screwing the cap, the tank started to bulge. The worker slightly unscrewed the cap which brought back the normal shape to the container. The worker repeated this activity twice while transporting the container. Then the container was put on a ground in the production hall/room (a place where potassium nitrate was produced). At 9:20 a.m. the container bursted causing release of the acid. The room started being filled with vapours and nitric oxides. ","The analysis showed that the container used was not designed for acids. The worker (by mistake and not obeying the instruction) took the wrong container. The properly labeled container was left inside the hall/room. The container which was used contained some residual quantities of hydrogen peroxide. During filling operation with nitric acid a reaction occurred resulting in formation of gases which caused the pressure increase inside the tank (bulging of the container's walls). The investigation revealed that: - the container ruptured/bursted along whole length one of its bottom edges (between side wall and bottom),
- the side walls were dented towards inside,
- the container frame (made of steel pipes) was dented towards outside.","Seven workers felt bad so were taken to the hospital for examination. There were released home after 3 days of hospitalization. Nobody was burned by the acid.
No damage to the environment reported. The majority of the released acid flowed to the holding tank (installed in the ground). The material damage was estimated on several hundreds of Euro. The production was resumed at 10:00 p.m. and was preceded with the analysis of the concentration of N2O in the air.","The rescue actions performed by the external units included the following activities:- evacuation of 30 workers present in the room/hall and the the close vicinity. - localization of the leakage location,- neutralization and sorption of the acid,- performance of the measures of the acid's concentration,- establishment of the dangerous zone,- ventilation of the rooms,- protection of the place where accident occurred.","In order to prevent recurrence the following activities have been taken:- for the storage of acid, the containers designed for 60% concentration can only be used including their proper labeling and actual legal proofs,- transport of the containers with acid can only be carried out when supervised by the worker leading the shift. - the instructions and procedures connected with different operations like: loading, distribution, storage and internal transport have been updated,- training of the workers.The operator was obliged to update the Major Accident Prevention Policy and to get acquainted all of the workers with it.

The warehouse was storing 238 cylinders of acetone, butane and propane (flammable gases) each containing between 1 and 3&nbsp;m³ of gas. Several cylinders exploded within a minute of the crash. Pieces of the front of the warehouse fell to the ground as the vehicle and several cylinders began to catch fire.&nbsp;
The site’s security alerted the firemen on duty at the nearby station, who arrived on site in less than 15 minutes. When searching the scene of the explosions, they found the delivery man opening by hand the valves of acetone cylinders stored in an open warehouse next door. The man would set fire to a cylinder and move on to the next one. One of the firemen rushed towards the man and managed to restrain him.&nbsp; His arm was slightly injured in the process. The firemen extinguished the burning cylinders and then stopped the leaks while the police secured the industrial area. The employees were evacuated, 6 complaining of headaches and slight hearing loss. The employees of nearby companies were told to stay indoors. A body without a head was found inside the damaged commercial vehicle. The decapitated head of a man was found when the gendarmes searched the site. He had been beheaded by the attacker just before the vehicle entered the site. The investigation was assigned to the anti-terrorism section of the prosecutor’s office. The Vigipirate national security alert system was raised to ‘attack alert’ level in the Rhône-Alpes region for 3 days. Security measures at Seveso establishments were tightened across the country.

A large amount of steel was ejected during the explosion. The ejection of steel damaged an oxygen pipe and a gas pipe in this area. The resulting fire in this area damaged a hydraulic line, which further intensified the fire. At the same time, the mould overflowed and the content of the tundish flowed onto the casting platform. This caused a second explosion, the cause of which is not known.
The hydraulic system automatically cut out because the minimum tank level had been reached. The emergency gate valves for oxygen and natural gas were closed.
The fire could then be extinguished by the plant fire service and the fire brigade. Smoke emissions from the roof of the steel works could be seen.","The exact cause of the damage cannot be established.
It is clear that there must have been water in the area of the splash core, which rapidly evaporated at the time of the explosion (volume increases 1&nbsp;700 times when water turns into steam). It is not known for certain where this water came from. However, it is likely that it came from a wet gunning mix, possibly water vapour from the heating process that had condensed in the pores of the repair compound.
It would however appear that the water had been stored in the pores of the repair compound which was found under the splash core.
As the trailing steel referred to above came into contact with the stored water, there was suddenly enough energy available for evaporation and the explosion occurred approximately 12 minutes after casting.",Material damage,"The fire was extinguished by the plant fire service and the fire brigade.

A gas boiler and a carbon boiler were on service. The mixed boiler was available for starting up with gas, and the previous team did various vain attempts to start. The message has been transmitted to the night team that try the same to put the boiler in service. An instruction is given by the quarter chief to go and examine the position of the obturator ONIS which allows to block up the main gas circuit.A few before the explosion, an untimely release of gas arrives in the underground, joined probably to the erroneous action of the ONIS obturator by one of the operators. The noise warns the quarter chief, who send another operator in order to locally intervene. The in-service gas boiler is shut down with urgency, and the personnel go out to cut the general supply at the level of the cut off place, 110 m away from the building. At this time the explosion occurs. Warned by the noise, the firemen arrive on place very rapidly, some minutes or more after the explosion. The red plan (help to the victims in large number) is immediately unlatched. 50 vehicles and 200 firemen, arrived from 12 fire-stations, are engaged in the fight and in the rescue. The different ignited fires on site are extinguished without particular difficulty. Various hundreds of C.R.S. men (compagnie republicaine de surete') participate to the fight against the spillage.The extremely rapid guarding (less than 1/2 hour after the explosion) of the businesses which have lost their shop-windows permits to avoid the essential from the thefts.The measurements made by universitary sismographs shows that the dissipated energy on the ground is equivalent to a load of 50 kg of TNT.","Without anticipating the conclusions of the on course judicial inquiry, the available information show that the explosion is probably linked to a gas escape occurred of the feed line of the boilers in the under ground of the plant, at the level of an operculum obturator ONIS installed on the line which supplies the only mixed boiler. This obturator found unlocked and partially open, should have been wrongly operated.The carbon boiler on duty at the moment of the event could not be urgently shut down.It constitutes one of the hot points more susceptible to have generated the explosion.Considered the importance of the network pressure and of leak section represented by this partial opening, it is possible that the power of the gas jet has been sufficient to create a suspension of carbon powder, that could have had two consequences:- the opacity of the local atmosphere could have prevented the operator to&nbsp;&nbsp; successfully intervene on the manual valve close to the leakage point;- the accident could have been created by an explosive mixture of gas and carbon powder gas, the behaviour of this last could have contributed to the violence of the&nbsp; effects.","An operator is killed in the underground, 2 other are seriously injured. The two remaining operators, although shocked, can leave uninjured the building. The destruction of a pavilion situated near the border of the site, 50 m away from the building, causes the death of a little girl, 6 years old, after 4 days. In the vicinity of the site, 56 persons receive injuries of different gravity and are hospitalized for care and observations; other 25 are shocked and receive cares on the place.

997,49,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release to atmosphere of chlorine in a PVC plant,2000-07-21 07:50:00,2000-07-21 17:08:00,"Tubular protector on the electrical cable for the submerged pump in tank No. 8 was damaged during pumping thereby leading to a release of liquid chlorine from the tank.On 21.7.2000 at 07:45 there was a release of chlorine to the atmosphere as a result of an operational accident involving the chlorine tank No. 8 (TK 2.01.C) in the chlorine store, building E 4990, in the electrolysis operations, PVC plant of the company. The release reached beyond the boundary of the company. At 07:56 h a level III chemical alarm was issued. The release from the tank was stopped before 17:00 h by the fire service in cooperation with workers from the electrolysis operation. During this time 12 members of HZS were treated medically, with 10 of these being injured (inhalation, acid burn). No other workers at the plant or inhabitants of the surrounding area were harmed. The accident had no affect on the operation of the production plants.On the 21.7.2000 at 7:00 Mr Majer prepared, on the request of the head of the chlorine filling shop. Mr. Juris, the pumping of chlorine from tank 8 located in building E 4990 to an external tank. After performing the necessary manipulation and checking the operational parameters of the tank he switched on the pump in tank 8. At that point he heard a loud bang, and saw that the store was inundated with chlorine, whereby he switched off the pump. On the basis of the reaction of sensor no. 5 of the emergency monitoring system (a signal is lead to the electrolysis control panel of the operational headquarters of the fire services) at 7:49, it is possible to estimate the time of accident as approx. 7:45. Obrat informoval Mr. Juris and together dressed in protective masks they investigated what had happened. Due to the heavy inundation of chlorine Mr. Juris returned to the adjacent building for breathing equipment. He then informed Mr. Kubist, manager of the chlorine, lye and ATA production, who at 7:52 called for the fire services (extension 150). After entering the inundated storage area, Mr. Juris attempted to determine the source of the leakage. He discovered that the liquid chlorine was leaking from the top of tank 8, where the pump was located. He supposed that the chlorine delivery route from the pump was broken, as the leak occurred at the moment the pump was turned on.In difficult conditions and with minimal visibility he closed the armature of the delivery pump above the lid of the tank and opened the armature of the deaeration tank to the chlorine production. He then left the storage area and switched off the storage area ventilation system. In the meantime, Mr. Kubista activated the emergency shutdown in the sodium chloride production hall. The fire services arrived at 7:55 am. A third degree chemical alarm was sounded at 7:56 am. At this time wind direction was 278° (westerly) and velocity was 0.5 m/s. The fire services began their investigation at 8:00 am and began to take action to limit the leakage of chlorine from the tank. At the same time, Mr. Stastny switched off the electricity in building E 4990. The tenzometric scales and pressure and temperature measurements of the chlorine tanks in the store ceased to operate. After the arrival of the fire services, Mr. Juris and Mr. Kubista briefed them on the severity of the situation and that the liquid chlorine is probably leaking from the pump's feed pipe in tank 8. In light of the fact that after closing the delivery vent of the pump the intensity of the leak did not decrease, they deduced that the pipe ruptured somewhere between the lid of the tank and the delivery armature, where there is a special steel profile.. The fire services managed, under conditions of very poor visibility and spraying liquid chlorine, to directly identify the leakage point. On the basis of the third degree chemical alarm and the information given by NES -OkU Melník, vyhlásil NES the warning signal ""Catastrophe"" and subsequently announced that there had been a release of chlorine at Spolena over the public relay system in the town of Tisice-Kozly at 8:32. At 8:55 the announcement was made in the towns of Vsetaty, Ovcáry, Drísy and again in Tisice-Kozly. At 8:40 informoval VDO zdymadla Lobkovice and Obríství of the accident at Spolena and requested the closure of the River Labe (Elbe), which was reopened at 18:30. ","A physical explosion in the electrical part of the pump due to a reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine. Failure of pump motor in the tank.The cause of the accident was a physical explosion in the electrical part of the pump due to a reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine, initiated by sepnutí of the electrical circuit.The explosion was preceded by penetration of liquid chlorine into the stator parts of the pump motor through a hole in the protective membrane of the stator with subsequent chemical degradation of the material and loss of the insulation properties of the conductors.A short-circuit occurred in the in the stator parts of the pump motor near the protective membrane, which was made of Hastelloa material, on the 20.7.2000, as a consequence of the loosening of several conductors, initiated by a chemical reaction with the chlorine. The protective membrane was exposed to high temperatures for a period of up to 12 seconds (time period until electrical protection reacted) and subsequently perforated. Then the electrical current was lost thereby shutting down the electrical protection. The reaction was subsequently inhibited by the impact of the presence of a large volume of liquid chlorine. Liquid chlorine entered the stator coil and protective tubing of the feed conductors through the perforation in the stator protective membrane.Due to the shutting down of the pump on the 21.7.2000 there was an electrical and temperature overload, caused by a spontaneous reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine. The sharp increase in temperature and the subsequent pressure (approx. 70 - 100 MPa) caused the explosion. The speed of the explosion cancelled out the effectiveness of the electrical protection. The upper tube of the pump motor was lifted and with a slight delay caused a pressure shock and the energy of the released gaseous chlorine caused the horizontal parts of the tubing of the feed conductors to break. Analysis of the quality of the welded joint indicated a clean break, without material defect, fatigue or corrosive damage.This resulted in the ejection of the remains of this tubing with the terminal block on the profile support of the flooring below the tank. The liquid chlorine then escaped from the tank to the collection sump no. 8.&nbsp; ","Minor injuries to fire brigade members - 8 fire safety workers of Spolana a.s., 2 fire safety workers of Meln Off-site losses still under investigation. By 18.9.2000 there were a total of 12 demands for compensation of damages as a result of the accident (animal farming, forest and garden areas, loss of earnings) to the sum of approx. 75 mil. CZK (2.5 mill #), from which a company in Knízecí dvur Tisice makes up approx. 74,5 mil CZK. The direct relation of these damages with the leakage of chlorine has yet to be proven.Compensation for company damages and evaluation of valid applications from the surroundings of the site will be solved in cooperation with the insurance company Ceska pojistova and other external organizations.","Level III chemical alarm issued at 7.56 am due to release of
chlorine beyond the SPOLANA plant, inhabitants of surroundings advised
to evacuate.Activity of the emergency services during the event is described in the description of the course of the accident Discussion with the regional fire council and the inspectorate of the Czech Ministry of Interior.Measures were taken on production operations downstream of the leak (LAO, EVH, KL) in conformity with the emergency plan, therefore it was not necessary to close down operational facilities. Measurements of chlorine concentrations in the atmosphere in effected areas of Spolana were taken by the fire services (8:45 LAO operation - 0.5 ppm, 8:55 Labe dock- 3 ppm). Measurements in the surroundings of the company were performed by EBS Spolana using a monitoring vehicle between 8:20 and 18:05. Measured concentrations of chlorine peaked at 0,6 mg/m3 (0.2 ppm). NES-OkU Melník also performed measurements in the surrounding towns between 9:25 and 11:40. The highest concentrations measured were 0.1 ppm.In an attempt to limit the release of chlorine to the surroundings of building E 4990, the fire services installed water screens and used stable hasicí zarízení on the LAO plant. At 10:16 it was discovered that a brown liquid was flowing from the outflow of channel K1 to the River Labe. The fire services installed a scumboard wall. Visual control, analysis of samples and the short-term staining of the water confirmed that a large flow of water from the water screen had rinsed the sewerage system.In order for the volume of leaking chlorine to be reduced Mr. Juris, after discussion with Mr. Fajkus and Mr. Kubista at around 9:00, decided to transfer the remaining content of tank 8 to tank 9 using the pressure of the chlorine. This however did not reduce the intensity of the chlorine leak. After approx. 60 min. the operation was stopped because the pressure in both of the tanks was presumed to be the same meaning extrusion would not continue. After 11:00 they attempted to limit the leakage by reverse air pressure to the delivery pipe of the pump and resulting back-pressure reduce the level of liquid chlorine in the delivery pipe, whereby improving the conditions under which the fire services were working to seal the leak. This was also to no avail.The activity of the fire services in building E 4990 was performed under extremely difficult circumstances (no light, whole storage area inundated in chlorine, liquid chlorine was spraying from the area of supposed leakage, freezing up of the lid). Contact with the chlorine caused damage to the protective clothing and gloves. It was necessary to regularly substitute fire services members in very short time intervals. Reinforcements were drafted from Melník, Neratovic and Kralup n/V. At 9:14 chlorine began to flow from the pipe in building E 4890, the fire services blocked the pipe at 9:38. The activity of the fire services inside building E 4990 on tank 8 was focused on plugging the supposed source of the leak using lead tape and quick-drying cement. Each attempt to stop the leak was unsuccessful until the pressure in the tank decreased at around 16:00, and it was discovered that the chlorine was leaking from the detached safety pipe of the feed conductor of the pump motor. The fire services finally stopped the leak by plugging the orifice of the detached safety pipe with a wooden peg, just before 17:00.At 17:05 the third degree chemical alarm was withdrawn at Spolana, subsequently NES-OkU Melník informed the residents in the surrounding towns. At 18:02 the second degree chemical alarm at the company was withdrawn.During the accident and after stopping the leak several management meetings took place to plan the necessary and immediate measures to be taken for stopping the leak and restocking of auxiliary agents. Were decided and specified further methods and activities for the decontamination of building E 4990 and tank (securing the tank for removal of the residual chlorine, provision of chlorine cisterns, methods of inspection and control in object E 4990 and its surroundings). Immediate measures were put into place - until the cause of the accident in investigated the remaining liquid chlorine pumps must not be used in the storage area.Information on the accident was relayed to the media by the company's press officer.26.7.2000 all the liquid chlorine was transferred from all of the tanks in building E4990 to the cistern. Decontamination of building E 4990, allowing entry to the building without the need for breathing apparatus was completed on 31.7.2000.On 1.8.2000 the police department performed an inspection of the site in the presence of members of the company's investigative committee. A preliminary enquiry and photo documentation was taken at the site.Decontamination of tank 8 was completed 8.8.2000. An internal inspection of the tank was performed and the pump was removed for inspection.Disassembly of the pump was performed and photo documentation was taken by the firm Neraservis in the presence of members of the committee on 9.8.2000.","-  immediate restriction on the use of submersed HERMETIC pumps for the filling of cisterns and transfer of liquid chlorine

1008,543,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Loss of containment of flammable hydrocarbons at elevated temperature caused by a failure at welded joint to main transfer line,2000-06-10 03:20:00,2000-06-10 10:00:00,"Loss of containment of approximately 11.5 tonnes of flammable hydrocarbons at elevated temperature, following the failure of a 3"" branch on transfer line between fractionation columns, on fluidised catalytic cracker unit recovery section. The release ignited and the subsequent fire caused extensive damage to the plant.  No serious injuries.
 Discussion about the occurrence:On the evening of the 9th June the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) was in the process of being restarted. The ""front end"" (see Figure A) i.e. the cracking section was started up successfully by about midnight. The intention was to then start the ""back end"" Vapour Recovery Unit (VRU or ""light ends"" section) (see Figure B) of the plant by progressively introducing hydrocarbons into each of the columns in turn.The main fractionator and absorber columns were successfully brought on line and then material was introduced into the Debutaniser column (E5) sometime after 01.00 a.m.At this stage the control room operator had difficulty in achieving the correct temperature and pressure at the base of the column E5 and this resulted in the relief valves lifting. Problems were also experienced in maintaining the correct levels in the next column downstream (the Re-run column E6) due to gas being present in the pump which controlled the liquid levels in the column. This was a common problem experienced during start up conditions.During start-up and before transferring liquids from E5 to E6, standard operating practice for plant operators is to dewater the transfer line using a number of drain points on the system. Dewatering is essential because if the water in E5 (which is operated at a high temperature and pressure relative to the conditions in the column E6) was transferred into E6 it would result in the water immediately ""flashing off"" to produce steam. The transition between liquid and vapour phases is accompanied by significant volumetric changes and this could potentially damage the Re-run column E6.In order to dewater the column a drain point at the base of the column E5 on the outlet pipework is opened and water is allowed to escape to the local ground drains until hydrocarbons are observed coming out. This operation is carried out several times prior to transfer commencing in order to ensure that all the water has been removed. The hydrocarbons discharged to the drain system are subsequently removed in the effluent treatment systems for the Complex and are not discharged off-site.Following the dewatering procedure the transfer of liquid from the base of column E5 to column E6 was initiated by the control room operator at about 03.15 a.m. This was achieved by opening a flow control valve in a 6"" transfer line between the two columns.At approximately 03.19 a.m. operators working on the plant in the vicinity of the Debutaniser column reported a leak of hydrocarbons (described as a white vapour smelling of ""spirit"") coming from the base of E5 and drifting northwards towards the hot oil pumphouse. The control room operator was notified of the leak and immediately stopped the feed to the unit.At approximately 03.23 a.m. whilst the plant operators were investigating the source of the leak and beginning to isolate valves, the release ignited and the operators ran quickly to a place of safety. A serious fire developed at the base of E5 and this then had an impact on the adjacent columns and equipment. There were no injuries as a result of the incident. The fire was automatically detected by a fire detector located in the Hot Oil pump house facing the debutaniser column E5, which alerted the Control Room.The control room operator isolated the feeds to the ""light ends"" system using the distributed control system (DCS) and within two minutes, despite the number of audible and visual alarms significant isolation of inventories had taken place. The damage to instrumentation during the fire also meant that the control room operator was unable to view the condition of parts of the process through the DCS system.The prevailing wind direction at the time of the incident took the vapours into a relatively open area of the plant where the vapours were able to disperse relatively easily. If however the wind had been in a different direction towards an area where there was a congestion of plant and equipment and ignition had occurred the consequences may have been more serious. Such a scenario had previously been identified in the BP CIMAH/COMAH safety reports for the FCCU whereby the possibility of a vapour cloud explosion (VCE) had been considered.","Branch failed at welded joint to main transfer line. The branch had inadequate support and was vulnerable to vibration fatigue and/or shock loading.  Old plant, circa 1950's vintage.  Change made to configuration of branch pre-1987.  Poor change control.  Pipework inspected for corrosion only.  No proactive surveys for dead legs/redundant drains.
The primary immediate cause of this&nbsp; incident was the fracture of an unsupported 6x3"" reducing tee branch pipe to the main transfer line between the Debutaniser column (E5) and the Re-run column (E6) of the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU)&nbsp; (see Figure B) due to fatigue failure. This resulted in the release of highly flammable liquid/vapour at elevated temperature and pressure, which subsequently ignited(probably on an unprotected hot flange nearby).There were serious operational problems associated with the FCCU stage two modifications in 1997/98 which were a relevant underlying cause of this major accident.&nbsp; These were inadequately dealt with by BP despite recommendations in writing from the HSE to review the process after a torch oil explosion late in 1999.BP reviewed the FCCU earlier in 2000, partly to try to determine why it was not operating properly (eventually traced to a blocked cyclone dip leg) and to compare it with BP FCCU world standards. The review findings were not implemented or communicated properly.The CIMAH Fluidised
Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) installation safety report 1997/98
revision claims and concludes that - ""hardware and software controls in
place on the FCCU are adequate to prevent the occurrence of a major
accident which could affect the general public, the personnel working
on-site or the environment around it."" Based on investigation findings,
this was partly unjustified even in 1997 when it was submitted, and
certainly did not reflect the reality by 10th June 2000 when the
cumulative effects of unreliability, numerous plant start-ups,
vibration and unsupported pipework factors came together. The safety
report was not proactively used as a management standard for reviewing
continued safe operation, nor used as an audit tool to verify the
claims made for safe operation. There were serious deficiencies in the
COMAH compliance regime and the safety report did not reflect the
reality of the plant operations and maintenance.","Extensive fire damage to recovery section of plant.  Significant economic loss.  No serious injuries to on-site personnel.  No injury to off-site persons.  Potential contamination from asbestos insulation on process plant in surrounding area.  Concern expressed by local community.
 Area concerned - Remarks: There was substantial damage to high-level steelwork and access to parts of the site of the fire was restricted until the danger from falling steelwork had been assessed (see Photographs 1 -6).The contaminated firewater containing hydrocarbons from the plant was generated in excess of the capacity of the stormwater retention facilities on-site, and this resulted in the release of untreated firewater direct to the River Forth.&nbsp;Smoke and combustion products were also generated as a result of the fire. However, subsequent analysis of the surrounding environment, both on and off-site, showed no sign of significant levels of contamination as a result of the incident.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged, either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts, and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater.&nbsp; There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area.The Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) has several very small radioactive sources which are used for non-intrusive level measurement in the catalyst section. These were not involved in, or affected by, the fire. Ecological harm:Contaminated firewater containing hydrocarbons from the plant was generated in excess of the capacity of the stormwater retention facilities on-site and this resulted in the release of untreated firewater direct to the River Forth.Smoke and combustion products were also generated as a result of the fire. However, subsequent analysis of the surrounding environment both on and off-site showed no sign of significant levels of contamination as a result of the incident. Gas sampling carried out on the north bank of the River Forth found no abnormal levels of atmospheric pollutants following the incident.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged, either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts, and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater. There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area.Overall the investigation concluded that no significant environmental consequences were identified.Community Disruption:Although this incident did not directly affect the local population, it did cause significant local concern, as it was the third in a series of incidents which occurred at the site in a very short period of time.Following this incident (and two other non-reportable incidents which occurred at the same establishment between 29 May and 10 June 2000), the UK's Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) agreed that the HSE would prepare a non-statutory report on the incidents and would make it available to the public in accordance with the HSE's policies. The&nbsp; ""Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000""&nbsp; (available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/index.htm) explains how and why the incidents occurred and summarises the subsequent investigations carried out by the Competent Authority and by BP.The report seeks to reassure the public that a series of thorough and detailed investigations into the causes of the incidents have been carried out by all parties concerned. In addition, the report is intended to demonstrate that a number of lessons have been learned both by BP and by the regulators and actions have been taken in order to improve safety performance at the Complex. The report is also intended to be viewed by a wider audience of companies, safety professionals and Trade Union representatives involved in the major accident hazard industries and to serve as a reminder of many of the issues that need to be addressed by safety reports for major hazard installations. Operators of major hazard sites are expected to carefully consider the contents of this report and the HSE will use Trade Association contacts, plus site inspection plans and other means, to publicise the incidents and to ensure the lessons are widely learned.Discussion of the Consequences:The fire developed on the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) at the base of E5 and had an impact on the adjacent columns and equipment. There were no injuries as a result of the incident.The prevailing wind direction at the time of the incident took the vapours into a relatively open area of the plant where the vapours were able to disperse relatively easily. If, however, the wind had been in a different direction, towards an area where there was a congestion of plant and equipment and ignition had occurred, the consequences may have been more serious. Such a scenario had previously been identified in the BP CIMAH/COMAH safety reports for the FCCU whereby the possibility of a vapour cloud explosion (VCE) had been considered.The fire reached its maximum intensity within 20 minutes but within 40 minutes started to decline as a result of a reduction in available fuel and the use of aggressive fire-fighting techniques (water and foam). Within 90 minutes the fire size had reduced considerably to the point where the remaining inventory could be allowed to burn off.The incident was brought under control and several hours later (around 10:00 a.m.) the incident was declared to be over. Damage was mainly limited to columns and associated equipment on the ""light ends"" section in the vicinity of column E5. Passive structural fire protection prevented significant damage to surrounding structures.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged, either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts, and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater.&nbsp; There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the response to asbestos concerns following the FCCU fire see the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/index.htm.Gas sampling carried out on the north bank of the River Forth found no abnormal levels of atmospheric pollutants following the incident. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the environmental impact of the FCCU fire see the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/impact.htm.Towards the end of the incident, due to the large quantity of water used for fire-fighting, and the fact that the capacity of the storm water tanks was effectively reduced by recent heavy rain, the storm water tanks in the Oil Refinery effluent treatment system became filled. Contaminated effluent from the FCCU containing hydrocarbon liquids was diverted directly into the Forth Estuary.BP made the plant safe by isolating sections of the plant using existing valves and then by determining how to safely dispose of inventories of flammable material. There was substantial damage to high level steelwork and access to parts of the site of the fire was restricted until the danger from falling steelwork had been assessed.","On-site fire brigade and external brigade attended.&nbsp; Personnel to muster points.&nbsp; Decontamination of site underway, mainly for asbestos.&nbsp; No disruption to public.Emergency measures - Remarks: Having been informed of the leak, the control room operator isolated the feeds to the ""light ends"" system using the distributed control system (DCS) and within two minutes, despite the number of audible and visual alarms, significant isolation of inventories had taken place. The damage to instrumentation during the fire also meant that the control room operator was unable to view the condition of parts of the process through the DCS system.In response to the original identification of the leak, the on-site emergency services were called to attend (03:21 a.m.) and by the time they arrived at the scene, ignition had occurred. They quickly set up portable fire appliances to control the spread of the fire.The Central Scotland Fire Brigade was notified by a 999 call at 03:29 a.m. following the ignition. They arrived at the scene at 03.39 a.m. and assisted in controlling the incident. The fire was initially attended by five mobile units along with a decontamination and control unit. Subsequently a further five mobile units attended with a standby foam tanker.At 03.33 a.m. the Oil Refinery muster point alarm was sounded.Plant operators helped the emergency services by closing manual valves (for example at the fractionator column) and by shutting down pumps to minimise the quantity of material released. The control room operator was limited in the extent to which he could assist to isolate inventories remotely because many isolations could only be done manually.The BP Grangemouth Incident Management Team was called out and within 30 minutes the Grangemouth Petrochemical Complex Major Incident Control Committee (MICC) had been activated at Grangemouth police station. Some difficulties were experienced with the reception of emergency responders and with MICC communications. Control of the access to the incident site was initially difficult to achieve.The fire reached its maximum intensity within 20 minutes but within 40 minutes started to decline as a result of a reduction in available fuel and the use of aggressive fire-fighting techniques (water and foam). Within 90 minutes the fire size had reduced considerably to the point where the remaining inventory could be allowed to burn off.The incident was brought under control and several hours later (around 10:00 a.m.) the incident was declared to be over.

The company was found guilty and fined £750,000.An Improvement Notice was served on the company relating to asbestos management.Official action taken - other action: Following this incident (and two other non-reportable incidents which occurred at the same establishment between 29 May and 10 June 2000), the UK's Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) agreed that the HSE would prepare a non-statutory report on the incidents and would make it available to the public in accordance with the HSE's policies.

The incident has substantial commercial implications for the site. (The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility).Demonstration that the mechanical integrity of pipework on the ""light ends"" section of the FCCU is assured, in particular, with respect to the following:a. Stresses caused by: ·Fabrication;Assembly and erection, including misalignment and structural attachments;Mechanically induced vibration cycling;Temperature effects and thermal cycling;Self weight and effect of supports, restraints and guides;Reaction forces and other shock loading;Pressure;Erosion, corrosion and environmental cracking.b. Dead legs and drain points to be minimised and, where retained, assessed against the above failure modes.c. Redundant equipment and pipework, including drain/vent points, to be removed, where practicable.The HSE investigation also recommended that improvements be made in the following areas of FCCU operation:-Change control - rigorous change control procedures should be employed.Risk assessment - a review of the FCCU risk assessment should be undertaken which considers critical process effects on start-up, e.g. de-watering, opening FCVs, exceeding process parameters, thermal cycling, transmitted vibration etc.Control/instrumentation/electrical equipment.Management review - a high level overview of unit operations should be maintained to ensure abnormal operation of the process plant is identified and the full implications assessed.Communications/competency - process technicians should receive additional training and instructions to enable them to recognise situations where there may be serious implications for process plant. BP confirmed that these recommendations would be addressed before the FCCU was started up again and would be dealt with in the design of the revamped ""light ends"" section.Measures to mitigate consequences:The Competent Authority investigation required that BP should take the following measures before re-introduction of hydrocarbon to the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) ""light ends"" section. The incident has substantial commercial implications for the site. (The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility).Emergency Shutdown ArrangementsDemonstration that adequate arrangements have been identified for the emergency shutdown of the ""light ends"" section of the FCCU need to be considered (in particular the following):a. Installation of remotely operated shut-off valves (ROSOVs) to allow rapid remote isolation of significant process inventories in order to minimise the consequences of an uncontrolled leak and allow remote emergency shutdown of ancillary equipment, such as pumps;b. Safe means for emergency depressurisation of columns or vessels, where reasonably practicable.Alarm FloodingDemonstration that adequate arrangements have been identified to ensure a timely and effective response by Central Control Building operators to those alarms necessary for the prevention and mitigation of major accidents, taking due account of the number, presentation and rate of presentation of alarms during plant start up, or other upset conditions, and any relevant factors set out in industry best practice guidelines (the Engineering Equipment and Material User's Association (EEMUA) guidelines).BP has implemented a range of measures to address these issues. Emergency response plans have now been updated to an agreed format and include reference where required to radioactive sources.&nbsp; Storm water tank capacity is being reviewed as part of the Complex sustaining capital programme.&nbsp; Procedures have been established to address the possible release of a range of substances into the effluent treatment plant during a fire or major incident.BP have reviewed and improved the on-site incident management plan.&nbsp; Area fire plans have been updated to the agreed format. A full review of the on-site emergency support provision has been carried out and improvements to the team organisation and facilities have been implemented.BP recognised the problems caused by alarm flooding and work had been commenced at the site to address the problem. A project is now under way to put software in place to manage the prioritisation of alarms properly. The projected timescale of 5 years for completion has been accepted by the Competent Authority.BP also carried out their own investigation into this incident. This resulted in a new site-wide emergency response procedure being issued to address handling asbestos and ceramic fibres during emergencies.Useful References:The official report into incident ""Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000"" is available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk./comah/bpgrange/index.htm.Alarm HandlingCHIS6 - HSE Information Sheet: Chemicals Sheet No 6 - Better alarm handlingTo download see www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/chis6.pdfEEMUA Guidance - Alarm systems, a guide to design, management and procurement.

1009,162,Major Accident,"Production, destruction and storage of explosives",Explosion in a ammunition dismantling facility,2012-06-05 14:40:00,2012-06-06 14:55:00,"During dismantling of obsolete ammunitions a major explosion occurred, killing three people and injuring more than ten other workers. The establishment was completely destroyed by the explosion. About 100 buildings in the surroundings suffered minor damages (mostly shattered glass).
Explosions in the area continued more than three hours after the first signal (14:55). Their reduction occurred at 18-19 h due to the strong rain. As а result of the explosions slight tremor with magnitude 1.5 on the Richter scale was registered in the region.
&nbsp;","The initial data from the public prosecutor's investigation indicates that the immediate cause was due to an operator error. The underlying causes are organsiational deficiencies, especially related to staffing, training of operators and their supervision.
The circumstances and causes of the accident and its consequences as a result of the investigations
In Workshop 1 a process of dismantling of obsolete ammunitions (military unit -green one) was carried out according to the Safety Technology instructions.
In addition to the green unit other, different obsolete ammunition - grey, egg-shaped, packaged / tare / identical to the green was present on the site.&nbsp;
Immediately after the treatment of the last green obsolete ammunition despite the abundance on working with grey obsolete ammunition, despite the lack of developed technology for disarming and destroying them and without informing any of the management, workers engaged in the operation of chipping manipulation of the grey warhead begins. It was at this point that the incident&nbsp;explosion&nbsp;occurred.
Explosions in the area continued more than three hours after the first signal (14:55). Their reduction occurred at 18-19h due to the strong rain. As a result of the explosions, a slight tremor with magnitude 1.5 on the Richter scale was registered in the region.","On June 5, 2012, at about 2.30 pm, an explosion occurred on the territory of the establishment with a series of follow-up explosions, as a result of which three people were killed and several workers were injured. The main facilities, buildings containing explosives, weapons, ammunition, equipment etc. were destroyed. As a result of the accident, 6 warehouses were destroyed (5A, 5B, 8, 9, 11 and 18). One of them was completely destroyed and the other five partially destroyed. The basements of the warehouses were not affected, but the metal structures were destroyed. The roofs of other workshops were also damaged. There were damages in the administrative building, checkpoints 1 and 2 and other structures.&nbsp;
The reservoirs weren&rsquo;t damaged - two-chamber pressure tank 2 x 200 m, fire-fighting reservoirs - 3 x 150 m and a fire network - 25 pcs. hydrants, road infrastructure and incinerator for light rifle ammunitions and pyrotechnic articles.
The whole establishment and the whole area were basically cleaned and secured.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the accident, a contract for cleaning on Straldzha Marash was concluded. Teams of specialists are provided for clearing the area and destroying the collected ammunition and explosives. Sappers, trained at the Military School in Veliko Tarnovo (15 employees) - former military personnel of the engineering troops - were recruited to remedy the situation. In September 2012, these officers began clearing the area on the basis of unusable ammunitions and explosive remnants.&nbsp; In 2012, a check with geo-scanners and a deep cleaning of the 3 km zone outside the Straldzha base was made, after the completed activities of the teams of the Ministry of Defence - 3415 munitions were removed from the checked and cleared 13 km in the area of the explosion near the Petolachkata. The cleaning was completed in August 2014.&nbsp;
The operator has recovered all damage caused to the private houses, to the public buildings&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the business buildings in the area.","Evacuation of the population of Gorno Aleksandrovo village (about 150 people, mainly women, sick people and young children, were evacuated from the village of Golno Aleksandrovo to the Blatets village). The population of Gorno Aleksandrovo village was not directly affected, but there was damage to their properties - broken windows, fallen plaster, rosettes, lighting, cracked ceilings, and panic.
The traffic movement from the Petalachka through Straldzha has been blocked. The Traffic Police informed the people that due to the temporary closure of the Sliven-Petolachkata section on the Sofia-Burgas road, the passengers heading towards Burgas depart via Yambol, Vinnitsa, Straldzha, Lozenets-Burgas. At the same time, people were informed that there was a possible bypass route from Yambol, through Sredets to Bourgas. The traffic in the direction of Petolachkata-Kotel was also stopped, the bypass route to Burgas from Kotel was through Sungurlare, Karnobat, Aytos-Burgas. The press office of the Ministry of the Interior announced that the Omurtag - Kotel road was closed because of the measures taken in the area of the Petolachkata road junction. The closest opportunity for the traffic movment was the road&nbsp; Pass of the Republic also known as Hainboaz Pass.","The&nbsp;lessons learned&nbsp;from the accident and the specific measures taken by the operator to prevent such accidents (including changing the risk potential of the enterprise, changing the type and quantities of explosives, dropping certain actions
In order to prevent the occurrence of such accidents, the operator has decided to no longer carry out ammunition disposal activities in Straldzha Marash.&nbsp; It also reduced the storage capacity of explosives in the storage areas. Due to this reduction, the establishment is classified as a low-risk establishment, storing a maximum of 48 tonnes of explosives on the site. This quantity is several times less than the one stored before the accident. All these major measures have been taken as lessons learn from the major accident that has occurred and prevention of new major accident at the site. The operator has introduced SMS, which aims to organize the activities in a complete cycle and provide the necessary records and documents for proving compliance, in accordance with the requirements of the Regulation for the prevention of major accidents with dangerous substances and to limit their consequences, with particular attention to the lessons learned.
After the accident and presently the establishment is still not functioning (on the territory of the establishment there are no activities: no storage of explosives, ammunition and weapons and no employees) due to the filing of a new indictment ( NOX No.1446 / 2017 according to the inventory of RS-Yambol) and a new case has been opened, which is at the stage of conducting a judicial investigation. The court proceedings on the accident have not yet been completed."

The worker suffered seriously burns to the face, torso and arms despite wearing personal protective equipment (cotton underwear, overalls, leather gloves with fireproof cuffs, dissipative safety shoes).","The operator's security committee analysed the materials, the material, the protective equipment, the operating procedure, etc. The raw materials and those manufactured were found to comply with requirements, the worker was qualified and specially trained for the manufacturing process in question, the manufacturing cell was in good shape. On the other hand, all parts of the sieve fastening system were not found and the metallic pieces (hooks and pins) and rubber bands that composed it were in bad condition. The operator concluded that the compound had been initiated as a result of the shock caused by the sieve falling onto the compound. During or at the end of the sieving cycle, two elements of the fastening system of the two sieves broke (or became loose) and the sieves were released abruptly and hit the 400 g of compound in the inside receptacle. The combustion of the compound spread to the 600 g of compound placed temporarily on the table of the cell.",The worker died a few weeks later.,Three colleagues that were close by took care of the victim (fire blanket and then an emergency shower) before he was transferred by fire fighters to the burns centre of Toulouse Hospital.,"The operator forbade the intermediate storage of active material in rooms with armoured doors, added to the operating procedure a requirement whereby the fasteners must be checked every day and instructions on what to do if there are doubts or the fasteners must be changed, installed a time switch to delay access to the armoured rooms, and equipped each armoured-doored room with a video surveillance system."
1013,72,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion of IBC due to incompatible substances reaction,2016-01-14 08:20:00,2016-01-14 12:00:00,"The accident occurred at around 8.20 a.m. on 14 January 2016 at the start of the process of filling an IBC with hydrochloric acid in 31-33% solution (fig. 1, enclosed). The accident caused pieces of the container and its protective cage to be projected outwards to a distance of around 20 m. The pieces, and in particular the metal plate on the cage of the container (fig. 2 and 3, enclose), directly hit the worker carrying out the operations, including on the face. The fire brigade arrived at the plant at around 8.37 a.m. Personnel from the emergency medical services (two ambulances), environmental protection services, occupational health and safety services and police also arrived on the scene. The seriously injured worker was airlifted to a hospital intensive care unit. The victim suffered cardiac arrest and died on 15 January 2016.","The operating procedure in place for pouring substances into containers with a capacity of 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;litres or more required a check to be carried out on any incompatibility between the product to be transferred and any residue of the product previously held in the container.In order to ensure that a double check was done, the forklift driver responsible for moving the containers was to select the containers to be filled and provide them to the worker who, after repeating the check, would fill them.In the event that occurred, the required checks were carried out by a single worker whose duties were both forklift operator and warehouse operative (responsible both for moving containers within the plant and, where relevant, filling them). In error, hydrochloric acid began to be poured into a container that had previously held sodium chlorite, with residues estimated at approx. (&gt;=) 1.6 kg still being present.
It is believed that the chemical reaction which caused the explosion can be explained by hydrochloric acid mixing with sodium chlorite.The stoichiometry of the reaction between sodium chlorite and hydrochloric acid is as follows: 5NaClO2 + 4HCl -&gt; 4ClO2 + 5NaCl + 2H2O The reaction leads to the formation of ClO2 (chlorine dioxide) which, as indicated on the safety data sheet (SDS Code: 50084, ClorDisys Solutions, Inc.) can give rise, in the gaseous phase, to spontaneous explosive decomposition in concentrations exceeding 10% v/v (low-order explosion). At concentrations greater than or equal to 14% v/v, the decomposition can cause a violent reaction (source: OxyChem Basic Chemicals Technical Service).
The initial error allowed interaction between substances whose incompatibility was in fact known and indicated in the procedure. However, issues have come to light that may have contributed to the incorrect operation:

the procedure in place at the plant envisaged a double check on the container’s label (indicating the substance previously held in it) by the forklift driver when selecting the container to be filled and by the worker filling it; the injured worker may have felt that he had complied with the procedure since, as warehouse operative, he was responsible both for moving the containers within the plant (forklift driver) and for pouring the acid from the tanks into the containers;
the plant does not have procedures for organising the yard as regards the management of containers that can be used for pouring operations (particularly concerning those not to be re‑used and to be returned to suppliers empty) and, above all, with regard to the incompatibility of substances;
the containers are re-used and the check on any residues and their actual nature do not appear to be done.
","The generation of chlorine dioxide through the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium chlorite and the resulting violent decomposition reaction (low-order explosion), together with the fact that the worker closed the container when he realised that the reaction was happening and that chlorine was thus being produced, led to the explosion and caused the container and its protective metal cage to break apart. The plate on the container&rsquo;s protective metal cage (plate of approx. 50&nbsp;cm x 40&nbsp;cm x 0.2&nbsp;cm used to affix the label, required by the rules, describing the container and its content) was projected outwards by the explosion and hit the worker (who was around 1&nbsp;m from the container) in the face, causing him to die the next day.","The Internal Emergency Plan was launched following the event. This involved deploying the internal emergency team, calling the fire brigade and emergency medical services and directing the in-house staff not on the emergency team to the assembly point. The emergency team moved the injured worker away from the area affected by the event. The fire brigade arrived at the plant at 8.37 a.m., marked off the area affected by the event and secured the site. They were supported in this by the findings of an environmental check carried out to ascertain whether toxic substances were present. The worker directly affected by the event was airlifted to hospital and operated on. He died the next day.Two other workers who immediately came to their colleague’s aid without appropriate protective devices suffered breathing disturbances, were brought to A&amp;E for the necessary treatment and were signed off sick for two days.","The worker involved in the accident seems not to have properly applied the procedure in place at the plant or perhaps felt he had applied it since, as warehouse operative, he had both the task of moving the containers within the plant and the task of pouring from the tanks into the containers.The company has revised the procedure for filling containers, seemingly strengthening the requirement for checks to be carried out by different people.The empty sodium chlorite container incorrectly filled with hydrochloric acid should not have been present in the area where acid is poured. In fact, sodium chlorite is stored at the plant and on sold on to customers in the same containers in which it arrives at the plant, i.e. without any pouring.The container used in error was present on the vehicle used the previous day by the same worker and not unloaded, together with a second container that had previously been used for hydrochloric acid and which should have used for filling.There is thus also a problem in how the yard is organised as regards the management of containers that can be used for pouring operations (in particular as regards those not to be re-used and to be returned to suppliers empty) and, above all, with regard to the incompatibility of substances.As regards the incompatibility between the substances sold and present in the plant (as indicated in the internal procedure), consideration should also be given to the need to check the containers to be used for pouring operations, e.g. to check:&nbsp;

the label identifying the substance previously present;
whether any residues are present;
the actual nature of the residues;
whether the container to be used needs to be cleaned.

A working permit was issued for the sealing, starting at 10 a.m., and the security measures for the works were considered to have been followed. The contractors, three workers from the company UMD, had started the works when they smelled H2S. When they communicated this fact to the installation foreman, he assured them that they were not in danger. Although they looked for gas masks in the installation, they did not find them and continued working. When the pipe flanges (Dn 150) were removed, the workers were immediately exposed to highly concentrated H2S and poisoned. The foreman, trying to save the workers, was exposed to H2S at a higher concentration and for a longer time, resulting in his death.

1017,980,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire in a cracked gas compressor in a petrochemical plant ,2012-12-22 15:40:00,2012-12-22 17:30:00,"In a steam-cracking unit at a Seveso-classified petrochemical site, an oil fire broke out at 15:40 in a cracked gas compressor.","Technical inspection found that an impact wrench had been left behind (probably during the five-yearly shutdown) in the third stage of the compressor affected by the accident. On the day of the accident, the wrench worked its way down to the lower stages of the compressor and ended up striking the compressor wheels, causing significant vibrations and ultimately bringing about a safety shutdown by triggering the safety system ‘strong vibrations’. At this point, a number of safety devices designed to restore the compressor to a safe condition malfunctioned: the compressor was not properly isolated due to a non-return valve that had become clogged and a motorised valve did not close properly, the electric motor being cut after the enforced safety shutdown, and the malfunction of the internal valve that should have guaranteed the oil/gas seal and pressure regulation during an enforced safety shutdown. These operating failures led to some of the cracked gas passing through the seal into the oil, which caught fire. ","Some internal fire staff suffered from exposure to extremely high sound levels (some hearing loss) when an 80-bar steam line burst on account of the high temperature. The fire was brought under control by 17:30. There was significant damage to the compression line on which the accident occurred and surrounding infrastructure, as well as to electrical fittings and instrumentation to this line and other machines in the compressor shed. The unit was shut down for 11 weeks, then restarted at half-capacity, with only one compression stream. It is estimated that it will take approximately eight months to repair the turbine of the damaged compressor. During the complete shutdown, production losses amounted to EUR 100 000/day. ","The operator activated the internal emergency plan (POI) and the petrochemical-platform fire staff stepped into action. Restoring the facilities to a safe condition called for the hydrocarbons (ethylene) in the unit to be flared, with the emission of a significant volume of black smoke for a period of 24 hours. ","Critical non-return valves to be inspected and repaired each time a unit is shut down for maintenance;
• The motorised valve downstream of the compressor to be inspected and the safety threshold for the cutting of its electric motor to be increased;
• A rapid pressure relief valve to be added to the unit flaring network under the automatic control of the compressor safety shutdown system. Protective measures have also been implemented on the steam-cracking unit: • Triple infra-red fire detectors have been added in the compressor shed and on the ground floor next to the oil-tanks;
• Continuous video recording of the compressor shed using new cameras;
• The sprinklers on the circular sprinkler arrays on the oil tanks have been improved;
• Initiation of the compressor building sprinkler system has been rendered automatic in the event of a fire being detected;
• The internal emergency plan (POI) instructions have been amended to include instructions for combatting machine fires fuelled by gas leaks;
• Feedback from the incident has been disseminated to operators and operator training stepped up on compressor safety and on existing and new safety measures."

Damage amounting to approx. 1,000,000 # and one member of staff killed.On 04. 01. 2005 during the morning it was foreseen to raise the ammonia level in the ammonia storage tank to a perceivable leve,l by pumping cold ammonia through a drain pipe. As preparation of this operation the injection of cold ammonia on the tank head was interrupted and a refrigerant compressor was started.In the context of this operation at 11:05 h the tank drainage valve, used as intake, was completely opened while the valve on the other end of the drain pipe was opened to ¼. During this operation a worker was staying on a platform at 3 m height, whereas another worker was standing below the platform. Both workers were permanently in contact over radio with the control room.Both workers heard an unusual noise after opening the valve of the drainage pipe. The worker on the platform closed the drain valve of the tank a few seconds after and left the platform over an access ladder. The control room operator noticed approximately at the same time a rapid pressure increase in the tank. In that moment (11:10) a loud bang occurred with the sudden release of ammonia gas which dispersed around against the wind. One worker could escape across to the wind. At some&nbsp; 30 m away he noticed the absence of his colleague. He immediately went towards the leak-point, finding his colleague lying on the ground injured and evidently unable to escape by himself. Nevertheless he was able to drag the victim out of the direct danger area. The victim suffered direct injuries and serious damage to the respiratory tractAnd skin burns due to ammonia.At 11:11 h another collaborator who noticed clearly the bang and ammonia release alerted the fire brigade. The fire brigade arrived at 11:23 h. At 11:37 first aid medical treatment was started.When the first ammonia release ended a leak appeared near the drain outlet at the bottom of the tank, more than 10m3/h of ammonia water were released an formed a pool in the retention pond.Ammonia evaporated from the pool and formed a visible mist which spread around at a speed of 7 m/s.During the following 4 to 6 hours two other leaks formed on the tank, located respectively approx. 90° to the drain outlet. At approx. 15:00 the fire brigade installed basins to catch leaking ammonia water, a vacuum pumping vehicle transferred the ammonia water into a storage tank which had been prepared meanwhile. From 17:00 h on the&nbsp; release rate reduced constantly, such that it was possible from 20:00 on to start pumping the pool of ammonia water from the retention pond. At about 22:00 the leak rate in the first leak was reduced at an almost not perceivable level, ammonia was still leaking only from the later formed leak points.At about 13:00 h the day after, approx 26 hours later, there were only minimal amounts of ammonia released from the three leak points. The last rests of ammonia water from the retention pool pond and from the drain pits was continued until 06.01.2005.","The test results indicate that the accident was almost certainly caused as described by the spontaneous evaporation of ammonia. The necessary evaporation heat was generated by the reaction which was released by the mixture of ammonia water and ammonia, previously separated by an oil layer.","Material damage inside the installation: The wall of the outer tank was ripped out of the ground, various pipes and steel structures were warped, the tank walls in the inner tank were warped.","Opening of the flare system valve at 6000 Pa (overpressure).Damage repaired: Measures to make tank and stairwell safe. Fuel depot can continue to be used without restriction with tanks 1-4; Environmental damage remedied: Absorption of ammonia water from pool, tank and drainage system and subsequent off-site disposal. 102 t of ammonia content recycled here.

Five sections of the workshop all exploded and were aflame. In the explosion, about 1200t of chemical raw materials (methanol, acetic acid and vinyl acetate) were burnt or washed with firefighting water into the environment through the discharge outlet of the factory. The discharge outlet is about 1km from Longjiang River and about 30km from the river joint section (Yangmin section) on the border between Hechi city and Liuzhou city.",Acetylene gas leakage,"In the explosion, about 1200t of chemical raw materials (methanol, acetic acid and vinyl acetate) were burnt or washed with firefighting water into the environment through the discharge outlet of the factory. The discharge outlet is about 1km from Longjiang River and about 30km from the river joint section (Yangmin section) on the border between Hechi city and Liuzhou city.","After the accident happened, the Company's organic plant production was immediately shut down to reduce the discharge of pollutants to Longjiang River. Local firefighters used a large amount of water to put out fires, but because the firefighting wastewater was too much, it caused a great threat to the water quality of the River. In order to avoid the secondary pollution caused by the firefighting wastewater, the emergency command center took the following measures in light of the actual situation: 1) pumped the wastewater directly into a newly built but not used wastewater treatment pool to be stored there temporarily; and 2) built four activated carbon dams using angle irons and wooden stakes as skeleton materials in the downstream of the sewage ditch. A total of 14.1t activated carbon was placed in the dams to adsorb pollutants in the wastewater. However, the emergency pool of the Company's organic plant did not work normally and no emergency levee was built, some chemical materials flowed along with firefighting wastewater into Longjiang River through the total discharge outlet of the plant. The emergency command center immediately asked the environmental emergency monitoring team to set up 5 fixed points and 1 mobile monitoring point at the total discharge outlet and the downstream sections of Longjiang River to monitor water quality and to track the head of the pollution belt in the river. They monitored the water quality once per hour. The environmental emergency monitoring team set up 3 atmospheric monitoring points in the downwind area from the accident site to monitor air quality. All these monitoring results provided strong support for the emergency command center to make decisions.
At 8:40 that morning, the emergency command center issued No.1 Notification to evacuate people within 5km from the accident site to ensure the life and safety of the Company's staff and nearby residents. At 11:10 am, it issued No.2 Notification to prohibit drinking any water taken from the downstream sections of Longjiang River below the accident site and notified various cage culture fishermen in Longjiang River to relocate their fish to safe watercourses. At the same time, it phoned to Liuzhou County's Environmental Protection Bureau to inform them of the accident situation to ensure the drinking water safety of people downstream. Because of timely notification, downstream residents of Figure Case-2-1 Scene of the incident site Annex 1 Eight Selected Chemical Accident Reports from China Longjiang River stopped fetching drinking water from the river; instead they got their drinking water from other water sources to solve the drinking water issue.

Because the plant manager was the only one present at the plant, he postponed the necessary purging of the gas pipeline until Sunday morning.
He and another employee put together a high-pressure cleaner in order to use the pipe-cleaning nozzle to remove the obstruction. The high-pressure cleaner was located approximately 6 m from the gas pipeline opening.
For protection purposes he was wearing a gas detector. His colleague was operating the flushing hose. After approximately 5 minutes, the gas detector reacted to the presence of methane (CH4), and he immediately turned off the high-pressure cleaner.At the same time, he saw flames pulsing out of the device toward the open gas pipeline.
He undertook initial fire-fighting attempts with a water hose while his colleague called emergency services (at 10:13). Then he closed all gas valves in the biogas plant.
He did not stop the fire-fighting attempts until the fire brigade arrived.The inflatable roofs on digester 2 and the secondary fermenter were damaged due to the fire, as were the gas pipelines and parts of the control system.Because of a short circuit (burning of the electrical equipment), the entire biogas plant control system failed.As a result, the agitators in digester 1 also failed. Because no mixing was taking place any more, within a few minutes the expanding substrate (high gas activity) overwhelmed the overpressure/underpressure relief valve and both gas overflows.
Because all gas domes were already full and the gas could no longer escape through the overpressure/underpressure relief valve and the gas overflows, the gas membrane of digester 1 tore at the seam of the attachment edge.The cleaning of the overpressure/underpressure relief valve that took place following the fire-fighting efforts was not enough to prevent this.

After completion of the loading process the fill hose was disconnected from the fitting of the tank container. It was found that the valve had not closed, so that in the following years, a significant amount of sulfur dioxide could escape from the filled tank containers. Several attempts to seal the valve or again connect the fill hose failed, first. Only after some time it came to a close the valve. The valve was then saved by a third closure device. The container was emptied again, and relaxed. As consequence 2 employees were injured, 190 people had to be evacuated.",Valve failure in a tank owned by an external company. Investigations on quick-closing valve determined that the event time between spindle and bushing was no sufficient clearance due to corrosion. This allowed the spring does not close the valve again after disconnecting the power supply.,Two operators were injured,CordoningPrecipitation of the SO2 vapours with water sprayEvacuation of two apartment buildings,After conclusion of the accident investigation

1040,639,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),The explosion in the vessel caused by an unexpected and unwanted formation of methylnitrate in a vessel for collecting chlorine residuals,1981-09-25 00:00:00,1981-09-25 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
During normal operation there was an unexpected and unwanted formation of methylnitrate in a vessel for collecting chlorine residuals. Probably this has been caused by the introduction of hydrogen chloride contaminated with methanol in the electrolysis system. The explosion in the vessel caused a break in the pipe connecting it to the chlorine condensation plant, and hence a partial evaporation on the contents followed. The plant was shut-down and the population outside the establishment was alerted.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
A sudden confined explosion occurred in a vessel for liquified chlorine residuals. As a consequence, the pipe connecting it to the chlorine condensation plant broke and hence a partial evaporation of its contents followed. CAUSES:
The explosion was caused by an unexpected (due to an inadequate process analysis) and undesired formation of methylnitrate in the vessel for collecting residual chlorine residuals from the condensation plant. Presumably this has been caused by the introduction of hydrogen chloride contaminated with methanol in the electrolysis system. No information are available about the real causes of the contamination of hydrogen chloride with methanol but, in any case, laboratory analysis procedures about the raw materials were insufficient.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:
Inside the establishment, 6 people were hospitalized due to the toxic release. MATERIAL LOSS:
The explosion caused damages to the plant but no data are available about the cost of the material losses. COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:
The population outside the establishment was alerted.Ecological harm - Remarks: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms.Disruption of community life - Precipitation fog: The population outside the establishment was alerted.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:
The plant was shut-down and the internal alarm was sounded. EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:
The population outside the establishment was alerted.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:
After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- a review of design and construction rules for new containments;
2- to improve the analytical controls of raw materials;
3- to improve the operating procedures."

1042,620,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Blast and bleve of a petrol products plant,2002-08-16 00:40:00,2002-08-16 01:50:00,"The event occurred during the summer stop: Atofina establishment stopped the plants on the 5th of August and it should re-start the production on the 2nd of September.All the plants were stopped for maintenance when the event occurred, except for the process of clarification of the Luperox DH in the interested tank.There was one operator in turn, controlling the system from the control room, inspecting the plants cyclically and actuating the necessary operation on the tank process.The operator at 23.20 of the 15th of August 2002, during his control tour, saw a steam leak from the upper valve of the tank and the thermostat joined a temperature over 120°C, he closed the steam valves of the heating and switched on the external cooling system of the tank. However the thermal decomposition of the 14 tonnes of processing crude began and at 0.40 of the 16th of August 2002 the tank exploded.The event created the total uncovering of the tank, the upper part was thrown on the roof of an electric cabin about 50 meters away.A ball of fire at an height of 100 meters followed the explosion. Some product burned, a part remained inside and the residuary gone nearby. The operator and the fireman of the establishment Solvay Solexis intervened powering the fixed and mobile anti-fire devices; automatically all the cooling systems of the tanks of the storage parc of LPG and benzene were activated due to the temperature rise detected by proper sensors.The national fire brigade of Alessandria visited the plant to check the tanks.","The heating of the tank D269 was with steam at 4 bars: to avoid mass overheating till a temperature near the SADT, the flow was manually interrupted when it joined 45°C, once the temperature gone down the flow restarted.During the plants stop, the control systems were under retrofitting works, (to transfer to a distributed control system DCS): in the control room, the thermometer for the temperature control of the tank D269 was deactivated, there was a thermocouple on the tank probe joined to a thermometer fixed with bails on the external piping. This has a reading scale till 120° without alarm system: the reading must be done in local.The fifth cycle of LUPEROX DH clarification started at 12.30 of the 15th of August with the heating and recirculation phase that had to end at 15.00 with the closing of the two steam manual valves by an operator that began his work at 14.00; the process had to continue with the recirculation. At 20.30 the operator of the 14.00 stopped the recirculation pump; at 22.00 a new operator began working he did the same things of his previous colleague, checking the control room and the plants.The 15th of August 2002 the operator during his controls saw that the upper valve of the tank released some steam and the thermostat arrived at the scale end exceeding 120°C, he closed the heating steam valve and switched on the external cooling system of the tank. The thermal decomposition of the 14 tonnes of processing crude was proceeded and at 0.40 of the 16th of august 2002 the tank exploded.The establishment individuated as cause of the accident the interruption of the heating steam flow: so the product was accidentally heated at a thermal level exceeding the SADT, creating the decomposition and the runaway.","The event of energetic nature had created the total opening of the upper part of the tank, throwing it on the roof of an electric cabin about 50 metres away, inside the establishment, it resulted partially damaged on the wall structure. Some product burned, some remained in the tank and another gone nearby.The irradiation didn't create nearby burns neither damages to the storage tanks: indeed the opening of the upper part of the tank D269 limited the damage only to this tank.There wasn't toxic clouds or damaged persons.People - Remarks:In Atofina there was only one person during the accident, in Solvay Solexis (Atofina establishment is in the area of Solvay Solexis) there were 60 persons.The emergency staff were composed by two teams of Fire Brigades of Alessandria (10 persons) and 5 emergency operators of Solvay Solexis.&nbsp; ","The operator and the fireman of the establishment of Solvay Solexis intervened switching on the fixed and mobile fire prevention devices, all the cooling systems of the tanks of the storage park of LPG and benzene activated due to the temperature rise detected by the proper sensors.The national fire brigade visited the plant to check the tanks mentioned above.In the afternoon of the 16th of August 2002 the department of ARPA of Alessandria took two champions of air, they analysed it with a gas chromatography and a mass spectrometry, any organic compounds was present. Environmental impacts were excluded after the monitoring of other matrices.Official action taken - legal action: There isn't a judgemental procedure.Official action taken - other official action: The technological risk unit og ARPA Piemonte (Regional Environmental Protection Agency) with the department of ARPA Alessandria have visited the establishment on the 16th of August 2002, on 20 of Agust they came back with the Civil Protection of Alessandria. The department of ARPA Alessandria have monitored the environment to exclude any impact on the interested environmental matrices. The technical risk unit have written a technical report concerning the event, sending it on the 21st of August 2002 to the Prefect of Alessandria, to the Piemonte Region, to the Province and Municipality of Alessandria.The provincial chief of Fire Brigades of Alessandria prepared a report concerning the accident, sending it on the 9th of September 2002 to the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Environment and Land Protection, the Prefect and Municipality of Alessandria, the Regional Inspectorate of Fire Brigade of Piemonte, the Piemonte Region and ARPA Piemonte.The Prefect of Alessandria with note of the 17th of August 2002 predisposed a technical and structural verification on the plant, to verify the safety before the restart of the activity and to warranty the continuous presence of the technical personnel during 24 hours in case of emergency.On the 21st of August and the 4th of September 2002, the establishment have sent some notes in answer to the requests of the Prefect of Alessandria.The Prefect of Alessandria with note of the 6th of September 2002 has requested to the establishment more information regarding the accident (ex: only one operator at work......). The establishment has answered on the 10th of September 2002.On the 12 of September 2002, the Regional Technical Committee of Piemonte has examined the accident, as asked by the Prefect of Alessandria and the local administration. During the meeting the Regional Technical Committee has individuated some urgent management measures to control the accident risks, to restart the activity they have asked the establishment to give documentation certifying the actuation of the prescriptions.On the 20 of September 2002 the establishment has sent the requested documentation.","Immediate Lessons: In the afternoon of the 16th of August the establishment provides the safety shut down of the tank D269, retrieving about 5 tonnes of liquid that remained on the bottom at the end of the emergency.The tank is unusable and the clarification of the LUPEROX DH is suspended.The establishment is predisposing a study based on the clarification process in vacuum with an equipment at a less hold-up and automatic control systems, as the actual plant process is inadequate.Measures to prevent recurrence: The LUPEROX DH process has been suspended, the establishment is predisposing a study based on the clarification process in vacuum with an equipment at a less hold-up and authomatic and repetitive control systems, as the actual plant process in inadequate.As concerns to the organic peroxides instability and reactivity, the establishment adopted proper managerial measures to reduce the risks of the processes, as requested on the prescription of the Regional Technical Committee and in the verification of the SMS.

In the area in question a CO warning device is affixed to a gas condensate reservoir in a blast furnace gas pipeline (the warning alarm sounds any time the fixed threshold of 200 ppm is exceeded). Hand-held measuring devices detected high fluctuation in the CO concentration, from 20 ppm up to 330 ppm. The on-call service, as required under internal contingency plans, was alerted. No faults were detected when checks were carried out of the gas condensate reservoirs and other installations located close by.
As the operation proceeded, the alarms on a further two CO warning devices sounded. However, when the emergency services arrived, no CO could be detected. The CO concentration at the site where the first alarm sounded also fell steadily until no CO could be detected. It is currently unclear how much gas escaped from the blast furnace.","The exact cause of the detected gas leak could not be identified. A wide range of possible causes was investigated, working together and in close collaboration with the district government. However, no clear explanation for the three gas alarms sounding simultaneously could be found.","Hand-held measuring devices detected high fluctuation in the CO concentration, from 20 ppm up to 330 ppm. The on-call service, as required under internal contingency plans, was alerted.
","- The police and fire brigade were alerted.
- Neighbouring roads were sealed off by the police until approximately 3.30 p.m.
- An emergency response was executed, involving all hazard safety services deployed.
- The plant fire service issued a D2 alert.
- The fire brigade provided assistance in taking measurements where the two subsequent gas alarms sounded. On-site:
- The exit to the plant was sealed off and gatehouse evacuated.
- Measurements were taken at the sites where the alarms sounded. Off-site:
- Neighbouring roads were closed by the police until approximately 3.30 p.m.
- Measurements were taken on neighbouring roads. - Neighbouring roads were sealed off by the police.
- Measurements were taken by the fire brigade at the two subsequent sites where an emergency operation was carried out, with the assistance of the plant fire service supervisors.","As part of an upgrade to the gas warning devices, gas concentrations will be transmitted directly to a permanently manned station and a form of pre-alarm displayed locally in the permanently manned station will be installed.
In this way, it will be possible to establish detected gas concentrations below the alarm threshold at an early stage."

Resulting fire burned for 18 hours before being extinguished.After loading a tank(no 12) with almost 1000 tonne of petroleum from a ship in the dock the line was pigged. The next stage was to insert a blind into the line between the dock line and the tank to prevent cross contamination. Valves B &amp; C had been left open from a previous operation&nbsp; and the non-return valve had been tied in the open position. When the blind (F) was opened a large quantity of petrol escaped from the tank and formed a vapour cloud which engulfed the operator. It ignited when it reached a diesel vehicle which had its engine running.,Main valve from the storage tank was closed but low point valves left open so when operator attempted to close Hamer blind (spade valve) high pressure escape of petroleum spirit produced large vapour cloud.,People - Remarks: 7 firemen treated for skin burns from contact with run-off water contaminated with petrol/chemicals in bund. Operator killed followed by mayor fire brought under control by fire brigade only to increase intensity subsequently.Ecological harm - Remarks: Large quantities of protein foam and 40000 tonnes of water used in fighting fire. NRA permission obtained to allow contaminated run-off into river and sea.Disruption of community life: Adjacent LPG installation 4000 tonnes was put at risk from fire.Discussion of consequences: During the fire escalation occurred on at least 2 occasions. Had this further damaged the plant then loss of containment of the 1000 tonne tank into the bund could have followed. This in turn could have led to the loss of the other 1000 tonne tanks in the same bund.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of :       Ecological component: water catchment areas and supplies for consumption or recreation - Affected YesEcological component: marine or fresh water habitat - Affected Yes,"10 fire appliances using pumps and foam equipment from Avon fire brigade along with British Aerospace foam generating vehicle (used for aircraft fires).

Fine of 75,000 Pounds imposed on each charge (total 150,000 Pounds). Costs of 20,000 Pounds paid by firm.Official action taken - other official action: Prohibition notice issued preventing use of Hamer blinds unless proper arrangements for detecting pressure and collecting spillage are made. Notice complied with by replacing blinds with double block and bleed valves (cost 100,000 Pounds).Discussion about response: This major incident was a result of: 1) Poor choice of control equipment. The Hamer blinds were unsuitable for this type of control because they opened the system. 2) Inadequate systems of work which did not recognise potential for failure (the firms risk assessment only foresaw minor spillages); and 3) poor training and supervision (fire check non-return valves were allowed to be left open). A precis of the judges findings is attached for information."," Immediate prohibition notice on use of Hamer valve unless there
is means for detecting pressure and safely directing material into
closed containers. There are issues here relating to other petroleum
terminals elsewhere in the country who use this type of valve to close
off lines.Measures to prevent recurrence: Routine opening of closed containment is unacceptable unless a strict operational procedure (written) is used. A much better system is the one now adopted (double block and bleed valves).Measures to mitigate consequences: The use of SPADE valves for these types of operation should be discouraged.Useful references: (1)  Loss Prevention in the Process Industries FP Lees 1989: (2)  Oil Industry Advisory Committee ""Guidance on permits to work""; (3)  Institute of Petroleum model codes of practice Nos 2 and 19; (((4) Fire precautions at Petroleum Refineries and Bulk Storage Installations and Marketing safety code ))."

On this account the accident is classified at level 3 of the accident gravity scale, as published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive.The quantity of reacting substance is estimated at approximately 100 kg of TNT equivalent (to be considered simply as an order of magnitude).&nbsp; On this account the accident is classified at level 2 of the accident gravity scale ( unless additional information becomes available on this point).The accidentOn 27 March 2003 at 06:16 h an explosion occurred in workshop no. 50. The noise was heard more than 10 km away.When the accident occurred, the adjustment operations were being performed on the machine, the shift had exceptionally started earlier (05:00 h instead of 07:00 h). The tuning phase took a bit longer than usual. At 06:16 h, the presumed time of the explosion, 4 employees were present in the workshop or in the immediate vicinity: the operator of the machine, an assistant, a person responsible for collecting the waste material and a mechanic who was passing in front of the workshop (on the right side of the tunnel). The 4 employees died in the accident. A large cloud of black smoke formed above the site but the fire was rapidly brought under control.","Several investigations were started following the accident: a judicial investigation, an administrative investigation and internal investigations by the operator. These investigations are still going on. The difficulty in looking for the causes of this kind of accident comes from the absence of direct witnesses and the destruction of the material elements. In this particular case two elements have&nbsp; contributed somewhat to reducing this difficulty: a witness went several times into the workshop during the hour immediately before the explosion (the worker of one of the kneading machine workshops who personally brought the paste containers to workshop no. 50) and the area around the Rollex machine was filmed by 4 cameras for monitoring operations from the control room and the images were registered. The analysis of the registrations shows that the initial explosion occurred in the feeder of the Rollex machine and then propagated to the other explosives present in the workshop. The explosion may have been caused by the presence of a foreign body in the feeder, which may have got stuck between the extruder screws and the metal body of the feeder. The experts cannot exclude a certain sensitivity of the dynamite although tests performed on the explosives produced when the accident occurred did not show anything abnormal.","The accident caused the death of 4 persons in the workshop and in the adjacent premises. Significant damage is visible. The cartridging workshop was destroyed, craters can be observed there.
In the adjacent workshops, damage was serious but limited. The beams surrounding the workshop apparently reduced the effects of the explosion. Damage offsite consisted in broken windowpanes, displaced tiles (up to approximately 550 m). No domino effect was observed.


","The on-site emergency plan was put into action by the operator. The fire was rapidly extinguished. About 60 fire fighters were involved in operations. The security perimeter initially established by the emergency service was lifted around 10:30 h. Traffic on the Deûle channel passing near the site was interrupted until 17:00 h.Site securing operations started immediately with the shutting down of the other workshops and in particular the nitroglycerine production workshop. These operations were continued until June with the recovery and destruction or finishing of the manufacturing in progress on the site, prioritising the operations according to the stability of the products (residual acids from nitration, then nitroglycerine, then dynamite paste..).Parallel to these measures and on the suggestion of the Classified Installations Inspectorate prefectural orders for urgent measures were issued asking for:-&nbsp; the definition and application of a schedule of measures for securing the site. - the carrying out of an investigation into the exact causes and circumstances of the accident-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the definition of measures needed to avoid recurrence of a similar event-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - safety inspection of&nbsp; the installations before any new start-upThe operator has planned to restart operations with a reduced production.","In a first accident report, the operator proposes the following improvement measures:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emptying of the pyrotechnic waste containers by the workers of each workshop or outside of normal working hours,2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setting up of a circulation and material flow plan of the workshops (witness lamp);3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modify or suppress the feeder system;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specification of a paste suited for machining (gluing, hardness);5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verify the suitability of the casing of the Rollex machines;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organise preventive inspections to check the state of the paste containers;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systematize the different phases of the testing procedure8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce the size of the feeders;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build the feeders in composite materials;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue the prevention campaign against foreign bodies started before the accident;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce the number of parts in the machines which can be dismantled;12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppress the toolboxes near the Rollex machines, and substitute them with toolboards having the tool-form outlined on the boards.13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install electronic torque measurement instruments;14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise the shock resistance thresholds in the compounds, investigate pastes with a higher tolerance to delays in processing;15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modify if necessary the waste material recovery containers under the machines16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigate the pyrotechnic characteristics of a compressed paste17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply the information contained in the documentation on chicanes for corridors and protected access ways "

The video surveillance system was working but the surveillance camera had been blocked with&nbsp;object (box?). The first explosion dislodged the object and the camera became operational again, so the end of the event was filmed. A series of explosions occurred for less than 10 seconds before inflammable objects (rafters, boxes) caught fire.","The woman appears to have deliberately set fire to stored products, causing the explosion.
Following the liquidation of the company at the end of 2015 and its takeover by a shareholder in March 2016, the former owner and his wife were still living in a house in the immediate vicinity of the pyrotechnic facility. The victim managed to get through the company’s perimeter, probably via a hole made by dogs in the mesh fence separating her home and the site. The fence complied with the rules regarding height.
The site’s intrusion alarm had been out of order since two days prior to the accident and was due to be repaired on the day of the accident. The operator therefore did not receive any message that the door to the store had been opened. Since the door of that building was blown off, there is no way of knowing whether it was broken into or whether the victim had a pass. The new operator has stated that, after taking over the company, it had changed the locks of some buildings but had not yet done so for the store concerned. The most recent site inspection had revealed that the doors, locks and remote monitoring station did not comply with the benchmarks in force (A2P2 and APSAD certifications).","The woman who set off the explosion was killed.
The roof of the store (made up of wooden supports and fibre cement panels) was blown off, its door was burned and one of its walls cracked. No other building was affected. Light debris (pieces of wood, boxes) was projected no more than around 15&nbsp;m from the store. The fact that the store concerned was located quite far from the perimeter and surrounded by earthen embankments prevented material being projected outside the site.",A neighbour notified the firemen after hearing two explosions and seeing red smoke.The victim’s body was found a few metres from the building.,The inspectorate ordered the operator to:&nbsp;&nbsp; - put the intrusion alarm back in service as quickly as possible;&nbsp;&nbsp; - check and repair the fence;&nbsp;&nbsp; - finish replacing the locks in all the doors in the facility’s buildings.
1047,613,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion of an hydrocarbon products cloud leaked from a temporary storage of water drained from petrol tanks,1999-12-10 10:30:00,1999-12-10 12:00:00,"The accident involved a 3000 m3 tank used for temporary storage of water drained from petrol and diesel tanks. This water, which contains traces of hydrocarbons, is normally sent to the treatment plant to have the hydrocarbon concentration reduced to the level at which it is permitted to discharge to waste water.According to the company management, the hydrocarbons normally lie at the top of the tank, with a maximum depth of about 10 cm. - which corresponds to a quantity of c. 20 m3. At the time of the accident, there was a depth of 3.4 m. of hydrocarbons, corresponding to a volume of 680 m3. For reasons which the company are still investigating, some hydrocarbon had been released from the tank, presumably from the vent on the floating roof. Apparently some of this material was then carried to the base of the tank by the internal drainage pipes. The tank does not have a retention cuvette.The vaporisation of the hydrocarbons led to the formation of some 60m. of vapour cloud, which extended to the nearby Provincial road Arquata Scrivia - Vignole B.According to witnesses, the cloud was ignited by the passage of two lorries. There was heard a first explosion, followed some seconds later by two more. Immediately after that fires were found on the roof of the tank and on the nearby transfer vessel.","In order to avoid icing of the tank, and to optimise subsequent water treatment, the tank is warmed internally to a temperature of 20-30°C by steam heat exchangers at the bottom of the tank.&nbsp; Preliminary investigations by the company suggest that steam may have leaked from the heat exchanger coils, thereby overheating the water, and hence also the hydrocarbons, which were therefore released through the vent hole.After further investigation:There would appear to have been an anomalous increase in temperature, perhaps caused by steam escaping from the heating system. However, at the time of writing this cannot be confirmed because the tank is still being emptied. Only once this is finished will it be possible to carry out a visual inspection of the roof and of the heating system.","The installations involved were the drainage tank, which was affected
by fire and explosion from outside, and, to a slighter extent, the
nearby industrial water reception vessels. The two vehicles travelling
on the nearby road were damaged, as noted in short report, as well as
the service vehicle of the drainage tank operator which was parked near
the tank. The shock wave broke some windows in the porters' lodge 100
metres from the tank. In total, the vapour cloud affected an area of
about 60 metres from the tank towards the external road. There was no
permanent damage outside the establishment.People - remarks:The drivers of the two lorries involved, which were proceeding in opposite directions on the Provincial road, were both injured, and taken to hospital. They were expected to heal in 7 and 15 days. As far as damage outside the plant is concerned, the two lorries were damaged, one in the cabin and the other on its canvas cover. Within the plant, there were damaged the tank concerned, and also a car used for internal movements.Ecological harm -&nbsp; remarks:The particulate material resulting from the combustion of the hydrocarbons was not dispersed into the atmosphere because of the meteorological conditions (snowing) and the amount involved. It was deposited immediately round the tank.Community Disruption - remarks:The provincial road was closed for about 1.5 hours, and, as a precaution, the inhabitants of some of the surrounding houses, as well as the staff of a nearby establishment (a materials depot), were evacuated for about an hour.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","The internal emergency plan was launched, with the activation of alarms, the shutdown of the plant, and the start-up of fixed cooling systems. The internal emergency squad was called out. At the same time the gatekeeper, as planned in the emergency procedure, called out the local Fire Brigade, ambulances, and police. After about 15 minutes, therefore,the external emergency plan was put into effect, involving primarily: the Fire Brigade, who took over the operations of fire extinguishing and containment; the police, who directed local traffic, blocked the Provincial road, and as a precaution also evacuated houses and offices immediately round the plant; and the ambulance service, called in to help those hurt.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Concerning points c) and d), for
which the default ""no"" has deliberately been indicated, it should be
noted that the transposition of Directive 96/82/EC is recent, and for
existing establishments there are transitory arrangements up to 2001.
It will be possible to supply the specific response when the relevant
inspections have been carried out. These inspections will be arranged
once the Ministry for the Environment, in accordance with Art. 18 of
the Directive and will look in particular at the state of
implementation of the safety management system intended to prevent
major accidents.","Measures to prevent recurrence: Since investigations into the cause of the accident are still going on, no particular further safety measures have yet been taken. Considering, however, the results of the accident, there would appear in the first instance to be a need for better - perhaps automatic - control of the temperature within the tank, with provision for the steam supply to be interrupted if the temperature rises above the safety value. It would also be useful to have written procedures defining the operators' actions for the drainage sequence.Measures to mitigate consequences: Considering that the cloud expanded over the highway, and that this was probably the source of ignition, the company are considering whether the carry out such drainage operations on tanker further away from the roadside."

The plant produces surfactants. The fire was extinguished by the on-site fire brigade in approx. 5 minutes. The water used by the brigade was collected in a tank. The substance leaked out in a region above a secured area of the plant. The area is surrounded by a gutter so no unsecured areas were affected. Phthalic anhydride (85-44-9) is solid at ambient temperature and is kept in a liquid state in the plant at a temperature of > 130 °C. It is classified as a harmful irritant (R41, R37/38 and R42/43) and is not listed in Annex 1 to the Incidents Regulation.","The ignition of the phthalic anhydride was probably caused by sparking resulting from short-circuiting of electrical cables positioned close to the ground. The cables were flooded by the hot phthalic anhydride, melting their insulation.",damage,The fire was extinguished by the on-site fire brigade in approx. 5 minutes. The water used by the brigade was collected in a tank.,"The following primary measures have now been taken to prevent similar incidents:
- Non-return valves replaced by automatic valves to avoid the risk of the medium (phthalic anhydride) becoming trapped.
- Covering of ignition sources along the cable routes.
- Secondary measures, such as the installation of monitoring equipment for detecting the escape of hot medium (phthalic anhydride), are being tested for implementation in the near future."
1049,112,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of hydrazine hydrate in an MZT plant,2016-10-10 19:45:00,2016-10-10 19:53:00,"On Monday, 10 October 2016, production was to resume after having been suspended for maintenance. Production requires, inter alia, hydrazine hydrate with 64% hydrazine as input.At 19.45, shortly after starting the pump pumping the hydrazine hydrate from the storage tank to the receiver tank, hydrazine hydrate escaped from a leaking flange on a +5 m platform of the production building.The hydrazine hydrate flowed through the platform drainage into building’s waste water pit.
Safety measure:As the start of the process was supervised from the control room and by an on-site staff member, the leak was noticed immediately and the pump stopped. As a further immediate measure, the valve to a neighbouring container was fully opened. As a result, the pressure in the pipe was lowered and the leak flow significantly reduced. The leakage ended when the pipe ran empty, approximately eight minutes after the pump was switched on. Another container was freed up so that approximately 100 kg could be diverted into that container.The quantity released could thus be limited to approximately 680 kg of hydrazine hydrate.",Leaking flange.,No relevant consequences.,"The liquid accumulated in the open wastewater pit, consisting of the spray and cleaning water already present in the pit and the liquid that had leaked, was pumped into an empty, enclosed wastewater tank and retained there.To remove the leaked hydrazine, the building’s platform and drainage pipe were rinsed with water. This rinsing water was also discharged into the tank via the waste water pit and retained.Sodium hypochlorite (chlorine bleach solution) was added to the waste water tank to destroy the hydrazine. The hydrazine was thus oxidised to nitrogen and the chlorine contained in the sodium hypochlorite was converted into chloride.By the time the maximum fill level was reached, we were able to reduce the hydrazine concentration to about 0.5%. The analyses show that there are no other substances above the authorised concentrations or loads. The water containing approximately 0.5% hydrazine was transferred to a total of two tank-containers pending a decision on its continued use.",New flange seal.
1050,248,Other Event,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion of flammable vapours ignited by the welding sparks during the installation a new pipe connection between two storage tanks,2006-06-05 00:00:00,2006-06-05 00:00:00,The incident occurred when contract workers were installing a new pipe connection between two storage tanks. Welding sparks ignited flammable vapour escaping from an open-ended pipe about four feet away from the contractors' welding activity. The explosion killed 3 workers and seriously injured a fourth one.The accident has been investigated by the US Chemical Safety Board&nbsp;,"Contract workers had to weld a pipe between two storage tanks. They removed the hatch at the base of one of the tanks, and entered to remove the crude oil residue. They flushed the tank with fresh water and allowed hydrocarbon vapor to evaporate for several days. On the day of the accident, one worker inserted a lit oxy-acetylene welding torch into the hatch and then into the open nozzle on the opposite side of the tank to verify that all flammable vapor had been removed before welding, which is clearly an unsafe practice. The workers laid a ladder on the tank roof, extending it across the 4 feet space between the two tanks. Almost immediately after the welding operation started, flammable hydrocarbon vapor venting from the open-ended pipe attached to the second tank ignited. The fire spread through the overflow connecting pipe from the second tank to a third one, which exploded. The lids of both tanks were blown off.Several unsafe work practices contributed to the fatalities and injuries in this case, including:- A gas detector was not used to test for flammable vapor.- Flashing tanks containing hydrocarbons with a lit oxy-acetylene torch to determine the presence of flammable vapour is unsafe and extremely dangerous.- The open pipe on the adjacent tank was not capped or otherwise isolated.- A makeshift work platform-a ladder placed between the tanks-was used.- All tanks were interconnected and some of the tanks contained flammable residue and crude oil.","3 workers standing on top of the tanks were thrown by the force of the explosion, fell to the ground and died. A fourth worker was thrown off the ladder, but he was wearing a safety harness that prevented him from falling to the ground.","Volunteers from the local fire department and personnel from the county sheriff's office quickly responded to the incident site following an eyewitness' emergency call. Emergency medical technicians provided first aid to the victims. Two victims died at the scene, a third victime died while being transported to the hospital.","- The company did not use available guidelines for hot work safety.- Available training and guidance offered by trade associations and member organizations should be used in the oil and gas service industry.- The company should develop and implement written procedures to ensure safe work practices during hot work, tank cleaning and work at elevated locations. This would have assisted workers in identifying and eliminating hazards prior to beginning the welding operation."
1051,707,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"Outflow of hexane vapours cause a fire in the far end of the extractor yard, followed by a strong explosion in a factory that processed soybeans for feed and cooking oil",1980-07-15 01:00:00,1980-07-15 00:00:00,"SAFETY SYSTEMS OR OPERATORS INTERVENTION:Sprinkler system was automatically activated at 55 to 60°C.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:On July 14, maintenance works were completed and, after the inspection by the plant operator, the start-up of the facility was initiated at 21:30. Steam was admitted to the toaster and to the jackets of hexane/miscella inlet pipes to heat-up the toasters and the extractor to the proper operating temperatures. At about 21:45 the toasters reached their operating temperature and admittance of flakes commenced through the inlet screw conveyor. After that, the following events occurred (the time shown had been approximately evaluated on instrument readings and information from the staff, as no log was in operation) until the explosion took place at 00:47:- 22:45 to 23:00: The night shift took over and at the same time the first flakes dropped from the outlet screw conveyor into the toasters.- 23:15: The toaster temperature dropped to 85°C. The plant operator therefore opened fully for the steam flow to the toaster jackets and the upper parts (direct steam) of the toasters. About the same time the safety flap valve was heard lifting releasing hexane and steam into the extractor building, where the smell of hexane was detected by the operators. This was, however, not an abnormal occurrence during the start-up.- 23:25: One of the flake outlet conveyors stopped due to overloading and the interlocking system stopped the flake inlet conveyor and the internal belt conveyor but not the other outlet conveyor nor the steam and hexane flows. High hexane concentrations were detected in the extractor building. The plant operator, however, was of the opinion that the steam and hexane flows were stopped according to the operation procedure.- 23:35: The flake outlet conveyor was restarted and the operating staff began to search for the hexane release point but without success. The hexane concentration in the extraction building finally reached a level which forced the staff out of the extractor building.- 23:55: A bus driver passing the facility detected the hexane vapours and about the same time the sprinkler system below the extractor was activated by the released hot hexane/steam mixture.- 00:15: The operating staff left the facility and from the Gate called in assistance of staff which were not on duty, including the chief plant operator (CPO). At the same time they stopped the above mentioned bus driver, when he was to pass again warning him against the possible danger. The bus driver informed the Traffic Control Center, which in turn alarmed the Police and the Fire Brigade.- 00:25: The first Fire Brigade unit arrived and decided to call in further assistance.- 00:35: The Chief Plant Operator (CPO) and the Fire Inspector on Duty arrived. The CPO went into the extractor building and located the leak to the safety flap, from which gas/liquids clearly appeared.- 00:40-00:45: The CPO and the Fire Inspector discussed how to stop the outflow of hexane vapours and decided to do this by cutting off the power supply. They called the power plant engineer and asked him to do it. Due to the inherent risk of possible sparks he rejected to stop the loaded transformers and instead, for unknown reasons, disconnected a third unloaded transformer at about 00:47.- 00:47.30: A fire seen in the far end of the extractor yard was spotted followed by a strong explosion injuring 27 persons (staff members, firemen and police officers) and damaging completely 6 buildings.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:Seed overpressure in the extractor lifted and relocated flap valve preventing reclosing. Based on the investigations carried out, it has been concluded that excessive amounts of steam leaking from the toaster to the extractor led to lifting and relocating of the safety flap valve. The steam leaking from the toaster to the extractor occurred due to lack of flakes in the outlet screw conveyors, which acted as a barrier against steam/gas flow. As a consequence, hexane was released and led to an explosion. Based on the available information it seems clear that the explosion was initiated by the disconnection of a transformer which ignited the hexane cloud.CAUSESThe leakage of hexane (flammable/explosive gas) was due to the incorrect operation of the safety flap valve caused by the failure of the interlocking system to cut-off the steam and hexane flows to the toaster when one of the extractor outlet conveyors was stopped. An unloaded transformer, disconnected by mistake just before the explosion, is believed to have caused the ignition of the hexane vapours cloud.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:27 people (staff members, firemen and police officers) were injured by the explosion of the hexane vapours cloud.MATERIAL LOSS:The plant (6 buildings) was totally destroyed by the explosion and, outside the establishment, the windows were broken up to a distance of 1.5 km. No data are available about the cost of the damages.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:Outside the establishment the windows were broken up to a distance of 1.5 km.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Evacuation of the extractor building. After the identification of leakage source, some methods for stopping the hexane leakage have been evaluated but the explosion occurred before any action could be carried out.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire brigade and the police were alarmed by a bus driver who smelt hexane vapours outside the plant and was informed by the operating staff for the possible danger. The police barred the area and the fire brigade were preparing for action when the explosion occurred. Approximately 20 people of police and fire brigade personnel were mobilised.Remarks: When the hexane concentration in the extraction building reached a dangerous level the staff was forced out of the building (code 7401). The sprinkler system below the extractor was activated by the hot hexane/steam mixture released through the flap valve (code 7102). The operating staff left the facility and from the Gate called in assistance of staff which were not on duty, including the chief plant operator (code 7107). A bus driver informed the Traffic Control Center of the possible danger, which in turn alarmed the Police and the Fire Brigade (code 7203 and 7201). Approximately 20 people of police and fire brigade personnel were mobilised. The first Fire Brigade unit arrived and decided to call in further assistance. The Police barred the area (code 7208). The Chief Plant Operator (CPO) and the Fire Inspector on Duty, after the leakage source was located (code 7999), discussed how to stop the outflow of hexane vapours and decided to cut-off the power supply (code 7999). The power plant engineer was called to do it but, due to the inherent risk of possible sparks he rejected to stop the loaded transformers and, instead, for unknown reasons, disconnected a third unloaded transformer (this was probably the ignition source for the vapour cloud). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","After this accident, it has been decided that this plant will not be rebuilt.MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:Following a visit of an expert group set up in France to establish new Safety Guidelines for extraction facilities in 1985, the following conclusions and recommendations have been considered for preventing similar accidents:1- release of gas from the safety flap must occur in a safe location;2- improvements for the design of the extractor building and its ventilation system would be necessary;3- improvements of the safety and interlock systems;4- improvements of gas detection and fire protection systems;5- improvement of the safety management.Useful references: More detailed information about the accident are contained in the document ""Ekplosionsulykken pa Dansk Sojakagefabrik"" of July 15, 1980."

It is a discontinuous process, and it is made up of a pre-reactor, a reactor and a post-reactor, as well as other auxiliary equipment. The derivatives plants are destined to the manufacture of polyols, polyethylene glycols and ethoxylates, each of them with different ranges of products.
The accident occurred during the production of the polymer methoxypolyethylene glycol, MPEG 500. Initially, a loud depressurization noise was noticed, lasting about 15 seconds, followed by a loud explosion. The entire product contained in the reactor at the time of the accident decomposes in the explosion and burns, and the exit of the toxic product to the outside is not expected.
Because of the explosion, a tank of propylene oxide is damaged. Because of the impact, a crack is produced in the tank with product leakage to the outside and product ignition outside the tank.","At the time of writing the report, the causes of the accident were unknown. The control room has been destroyed and with it, some or all the information in the control system on all the conditions in which the installation was working in the moments immediately prior to the explosion.&nbsp; In addition, it must be taken into account that the facilities cannot be accessed without judicial authorization.","

1053,89,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) from a rundown tank at a VCM facility.,2015-09-16 15:35:00,2015-09-16 16:04:00,"On 15&nbsp;September&nbsp;2015, an alert (measurement position — rundown) was registered in the VCM control room. Investigations into the cause revealed a leak in the stuffing box of a valve.The shift foreman then used the distributed control system (15&nbsp;September&nbsp;2015, 23.15, DCS standby) to bridge two high vacuum (HV) valves (referred to in-house as ‘forced’ (forced into another valve position)) -&gt; valve position closed (entry present in the VCM facility’s bridge log book). The system was subsequently released and prepared for a valve replacement the next day.The valve replacement was carried out without incident and was handed over once production was complete.Production staff carried out a leakage test on the system (results negative). For the necessary oxygen-free purge, a nitrogen purge (7-8&nbsp;bar) of the previously opened system was carried out. The purging process involved releasing the purging medium (N2) into the atmosphere via a 2” valve. On 16&nbsp;September&nbsp;2015, from 15.34 to 16.04, a substance release (liquid VCM) occurred via the 2” valve.Safety function: The alarm (measuring point: 585&nbsp;ppm) was activated in the control room at 15.53. No explosion warning devices were triggered. The control room operator informed the external operator and the shift foreman, both of whom then went to the part of the facility affected.There the leak was detected (VC leak, 2” flush nozzle, approx. 1-2&nbsp;bar). Breathing protection equipment was fetched, which the shift foreman wore while closing the flush nozzle and ending the leak. The liquid VCM was collected from the area subject to the Federal Water Act. The VC vaporised and ice/snow formed, along with a gas cloud (light southerly wind in the direction of the VC spheres). A large part of the area was cordoned off and the VC was transferred into a nearby collecting basin by production staff (breathing protection, chemical protective suit, rubber boots) and channelled into the internal sewage system using water. At no point during the incident was the on-site fire service alerted.The analysis in the distributed control system (DCS) estimated a total of around 5&nbsp;t of VCM.","The system was to be put back in operation. To this end, the shift foreman ordered an O2 analysis to be carried out by the laboratory. This measurement had not yet been taken.On the assumption that an HV valve remains in the closed position following the removal of the ‘DCS bridge’ until an acknowledgement from the control room, the shift foreman ordered the DCS team to remove the ‘bridge’ in the DCS.There was no direct contact between the shift foreman and the DCS team; the DCS team member was in contact with the control room operator. However, when the ‘bridge’ was removed, the valve was opened and VCM from a higher rundown tank was able to escape via the 2” valve that had been opened for purging, leading to the substance release. In order to bring a swift end to substance leaks, a facility kill switch for the rundown section is provided, which closes all tank outlets, including the HV valve. However, this feature was not activated, either on-site or from the control room.
Direct causes1) Circumstances:- Open venting valve (2” valve for purging) and simultaneous opening of an HV valve by removing the bridge.- No additional closure or separation in the intake.
2) Actions:Safety features taken out of operation:- Instruction to DCS staff to remove the bridge.- DCS staff removed the ‘bridge’ (HV valve forced ‘shut’).
Non-compliance with basic safety regulations:- No additional separation (e.g. blanking spade) deemed necessary by production staff.
(Wrong) decisions made:- Purging the pipe with nitrogen and releasing it into the air via a 2” venting valve.- O2 analysis required but not yet carried out; nonetheless, clearance given to remove the ‘bridge’.
Indirect causes:Training:- Insufficient knowledge of the workings of the part of the facility and the ‘bridge’ that had been put in place.
Communication:- No compulsory communication method agreed (e.g. signed form) between those responsible for removing bridges.- No direct communication between the shift foreman and DCS staff. Inadequate or non-existent safety regulations:- Rules for working on parts of the facility that channel the product and for separating the systems unclear.- No clear regulations on purging systems.- No uniform regulations established with regard to bridges, and in particular removing bridges and the necessary communication and clearance. As regards the remaining series of events following the substance release, it should be noted that there was insufficient knowledge of the contingency measures required according to the alarm and danger prevention plan. Measures taken, such as transferring the escaped substance without special explosions prevention measures, are also subject to criticism.",No impairment of people / employees inside and outside the establishment. also no impact to property or environmental impact. Water was used to flush the escaped VCM into the internal sewage system to prevent further vaporisation.,"The substance release was detected through the triggering of a sensor in the stationary measuring system for VCM (COMA system). Following an investigation, the venting valve was closed using breathing protection.Water was then used to flush the VCM into the internal sewage system.&nbsp;
Water was used to flush the escaped VCM into the internal sewage system to prevent further vaporisation.","Short term:- All employees informed about the incident.- Shift foreman and deputy given training on how the barriers work on the rundown tanks and the safe approach when working in this area. Medium term:

Training on the strictly compulsory contingency measures under the alarm plan and how to handle leaks of hazardous substances, in particular VCM.
Creation of clear and unambiguous regulations on:

- working on parts of the facility that channel the product and separating the systems (required partitions, authorisation, identification, etc.);- purging the systems;- bridging, and in particular removing bridges and the required communication and clearance. Direct technical measures were not identified, as this was an incident which occurred not during normal operation, but during repair works, which can occur in such a form in any part of the facility. A specific technical measure did not therefore seem expedient; instead the organisational systems and regulations must be adjusted so that sufficient safety measures are taken whenever work is being carried out on systems channelling hazardous substances."

Event occurred in Thessaloniki bay due to flash fire following a gasoline spill during tanker unloading.,"During the operation of gasoline unloading from the oil tanker ""KRITI GOLD"" to HELPE sea berth installation, weather conditions deteriorated and the unloading procedure was interrupted. The unloading hose was disconnected and blinded. When the wind exceeded 9 Beaufort, 2 ropes connected to one mooring buoy broke, the tanker moved, the floating stabilizers of the ship hooked the hoses causing rupture of the product underwater pipe. As a result, part of the hoses' and the underwater pipe's content leaked forming a gasoline oil spill. Two tug boats were unsuccessfully trying to keep the tanker in position. The source of the ignition originated from the tug boat closer to the gasoline spill, which caught fire. The incident is under judicial investigation.","4 fatalities, crew of one tug boat. On-site effects: Damage of the underwater steel pipe and hose strings. Loss of gasoline. Off-site effects: Extensive damage of tug boat.",The gasoline burnt and exhausted. The fire lasted 15 minutes. Some tug boats and one firefighting boat helped to protect the tanker from the fire and to prevent the fire spreading to it. All measures were taken off-site measures.,"No lessons learned so far. Major factors contributing to the occurrence of the incident were the wind force, above 9 Beaufort, and the wind east direction moving the tanker towards sea berth installations.

When the emergency services arrived, the unit had been filled with foam up to the 10-metre-high ceiling.
A team of three firefighters, equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), entered an adjacent room to check that the anti-fire doors were properly closed. As they advanced, physical and radio contact with one of the firefighters was lost (an experienced female fire officer [lieutenant] aged 46).","Forensic analysis showed that the foam had an unusually compact and sticky consistency (compared to cream cheese), which forced the three SCBA-equipped firefighters attending the scene to overconsume air and meant that their masks were no longer airtight and slipped on their faces. Due to the density of the foam, the victim did not have any visual contact with or means of contacting the other members of the team of three. The victim had lost contact with her direct teammate because her buddy contact rope was attached to a snap hook on her teammate’s backpack, when it should have been attached to their belt. When the victim’s teammates decided to turn around due to the shortage of air in their self-contained breathing equipment, they left their backpacks on the ground and the victim was left on her own, disorientated and lacking air, unaware of this decision.","When the victim was found, she was in a coma, without her SCBA equipment and with her buddy rope unattached. In removing the victim from the scene, one firefighter sustained a minor hand injury.
The victim died three days later; her emergency response equipment (suit, mask, rope) was seized by the judicial authorities for investigation and the foam was also analysed. The fact that the foam remained in the building for several days disrupted the judicial forensic experts’ investigations. The inspection of the unit in question, which became accessible a few days later, did not show any trace of an initial fire and the most probable hypothesis is that the fire detection system was triggered in an untimely fashion by a short-circuit.
An autopsy of the victim confirmed death due to suffocation.

1057,1040,Major Accident,Other activity (not otherwise specified int the list),Aromatic hydrocarbon leak at tar product processing plant,2012-07-20 11:38:00,2012-07-20 19:00:00,"At about 11:40 on 20 July 2012 there was a breakdown in the loading area where aromatic hydrocarbons were being loaded. This was triggered by an unexplained malfunction of two quick-closing valves which are installed to protect the pipeline at a ship loading facility. The closure of the valves resulted in an increase in pressure in the loading pipeline. As a result of this increase in pressure the pump housing ruptured and approx. 20 to 24 t of the product entered the catch basin in the pump house and two unused tanks.
The increase in pressure also resulted in damage to the transport pipeline about 250 m away from the pump. This damage was caused by corrosion resulting from faulty external insulation. The leak resulted in about 200 l of product being released from the damaged pipeline and entering the soil. No conclusive reason for the malfunction of the quick-closing valves could be found.",It is clear that the leaks were caused by a pressure increase and defective components. The reason why the quick-closing valves were shut off – which triggered the incident – remains unclear.,"- Pump destroyed,
- Section of pipeline replaced Soil contamination, approximately 2 m3 of earth (disposed of).","The pipeline has a PN 16 pressure rating. Once pressure reaches 12 bar, the loading pump cuts out. Once pressure reaches 14 bar, the hydraulic accumulator (bladder accumulator) operates in order to compensate for ruptures, which is achieved by quickly closing valves. Neither of these safety devices activated. Both devices were inspected and found to be in full working order.
This suggests that the pressure was less than 12 bar. The maximum build-up of pressure which the pump can achieve is 9.6 bar. Normal operating pressure is 4-5 bar. Safety measures taken: plant fire service alerted, response carried out using full protection and independent breathing equipment, fluid covered with foam, removal (excavation) of contaminated earth under pipe leak, collection area pumped clear and cleaned. - Fluid contained,
- Covered by foam - Defective pipeline replaced,
- Pump will be replaced - Excavation,
- Additional expert assessment carried out.","- Risk analysis (PAAG procedure) carried out for the affected area.
- Bypass pumps removed and pipeline routing changed. Loading now done only using the ships’ own pumps and no longer land-based pumps.
- The loading pump is wired to the quick-closing valves.
- Pipeline register has been drawn up and a systematic check is made of what inspection requirements must be met under the VAwS (Regulation on plants handling substances hazardous to water), BetrSichV (Industrial Safety Regulation) and StörfallV (Hazardous Incident Regulation).
- For three of the five pipelines which run out of the plant site an inspection requirement applies under the BetrSichV and VAwS. These three pipelines have now been inspected by an approved expert. The faults found have been rectified or are being dealt with."

The storage room takes up half of a building, with the other half being used for prototype construction. The front of the storage room consisted of double steel doors with large glass window panes. The back of the room consisted of glass bricks on the upper third. The other walls were solid walls with no windows.
There were steel cabinets along one wall, the first of which, nearest the door, was used as a chemical cabinet with forced ventilation for the storage of small quantities of e.g. solvent-based cleaning agents, adhesives and other auxiliaries. There were open steel shelves opposite the cabinets.
No explosives were stored in the room in accordance with the operating instructions. It was only used for material storage during the working day.
Description of the incident:At 4.00 a.m. on 22 August 2012 popping noises were heard coming from a building (storage room and prototype construction) by a guard.
When he approached the building, he saw flames flaring out of a window. At the time, there were no other persons in the area of the warehouse.
The fire brigade was called and extinguished the fire. Local residents were also advised to keep windows closed.
The next day it became apparent that the fire had started in a chemical cabinet in the storage room. Signs of deflagration could also be identified, as all of the cabinet doors were open in one direction due to the pull of the flame front.
Resistant walls prevented the fire spreading to other parts of the building.
External helpers were requested in accordance with the emergency plan.","The cause of the fire cannot be conclusively determined. The expert on causes of fire confirmed in his report that the hazardous substance cabinet on the left side of the building was the place where the fire/explosion started. The burn marks indicate that the hazardous substances had ignited and burned through in the cabinet in which they were stored, eventually causing the cabinet and then the doors of the building to open under pressure.
It could also not be ruled out that the fire had been caused by a technical defect in a fan motor on the cabinet due to the severe damage to the fan.
The examination of the safety cabinet showed that it met the requirements of Technical Rule for Hazardous Substances (TRGS) 510. The cabinet should have been checked by the manufacturer in March 2012. A check would not have prevented the fire from starting. Other cabinets of the same design which were inspected on site had no apparent faults. In principle, the cabinet used was suitable for storing the chemicals employed.",Cause cannot be established,"- Safety measures according to fire brigade and internal emergency plan;- Fire watch.&nbsp;
As a precaution, the water used to extinguish the fire, which had accumulated in the drains and dry wells, was collected in IBC containers for disposal.Measurements carried out by an institute showed no contamination of the water.","- In-house instructions on the storage of hazardous substances have been revised.- The storage recommendations made in the fire investigation were included.- Staff will be trained.- Emergency management is being continuously practised and improved.&nbsp;
Lessons learned from the incident:Since it is possible the fire was caused by an exothermic chemical reaction of substances as a result of external contamination and the substances dripping from the stored containers, the operator took action to store hazardous materials in hazardous substance cabinets. The operating instructions for hazardous substance cabinets have been revised.
The main points are:- Contaminated containers must not be used;- Solvents/chemicals must be stored only in tightly sealed containers;- Ventilation grills on the hazardous substance cabinets must not be blocked;- Use drip trays made of non-combustible material under containers;- Packaging (cardboard, film) must not be stored in the hazardous substance cabinet as they constitute fire loads;- Monthly operational testing of extraction inside the cabinets.&nbsp;
Lessons from the incident:Hazardous substance cabinets are usually designed to prevent fire from entering from the outside.The potential dangers from a fire started inside the cabinet are often overlooked in hazardous substance and risk assessments."
1059,493,Other Event,Manufacture of food products and beverages,Asphyxiation of two employees of a natural food additive production plant,2001-02-15 18:30:00,2001-02-15 00:00:00,On 15th February 2001 two employees of a natural food additive production plant died of asphyxiation while operating on the pump of a draining trap for the recovery of draining juice from filter cakes.This accident is classified at level 3 of the industrial accident gravity scale because 2 employees died. The accident is notified for the technical relevance of certain aspects of the occurrence.,"The filtering cakes are made of sulphurised organic material which by anaerobic fermentation releases hydrogen sulphide and methane. The generation and release of such substances is not avoidable.The meteorological conditions (heavy rains) during the weeks before the occurrence prevented turning over of the pile, according to the operator. The anaerobic fermentation process was thus favoured. These high humidity conditions significantly increased the production of H2S. The water tightness of the storage area, carried out in order to recover the draining liquid confined the gas in the drainage system located under the geomembrane.The automatic control of the draining trap pump makes it possible to maintain the level of the liquid below the level of the draining system. The measurements performed by the operator showed H2S concentration of at least 500 ppm (measurement limit of the detector employed). The assumption of a gas pocket formed in the drainage system, which may have been freed through the intervention of the two employees and then released into the atmosphere over a drain pipe during the preliminary drainage of the draining trap has not been verified, given that dangerous H2S concentrations were reached anyhow.",Following the disconnection of the output pipe of the draining trap pump two workers intervened and started emptying the draining trap. They then entered the drain trap in unspecified conditions (there were no witnesses to the accident). Alarm was raised three hours later when the non-return of the two workers was noticed; the workers were found on the bottom of the drain trap.,No action is executed before the discovering of the 2 people died.,"Considering the H2S and CH4 concentrations measured and the relating hazards (toxicity and explosiveness), on 26th February 2001 the Inspectorate for Classified Installations (DRIRE) proposed issuing a series of urgent prefectoral orders aiming at classifying the storage area as a controlled zone and the areas around the draining trap and the waste gas vent as danger zones, defining the procedures in case of intervention (access limitation, preliminary measurements of the atmosphere...)The operator has already planned modification of the discharge pipe of the pump in such way that accessing the draining traps will not be necessary. This modification will be carried out after authorisation of the judicial authority in charge of the investigation.Besides immediate measures to be taken with respect to the probable causes of the accident, the Inspectorate for Classified Installations is studying longer term technical changes to minimise the hazards caused by the unavoidable formation of these gases.For this reason the Inspectorate has asked the operator to study and propose feasible measures to optimise the management procedures of the filter cake storage (amounts produced, storage time, aeration frequencies of the piles) and to avoid areas of possible gas accumulation.The Classified Installations Inspectorate has also requested an updating of the Safety Report concerning all activities of the installation.The Classified Installations Inspectorate has also requested an updating of the Safety Report concerning all activities of the installation."
1060,824,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Fire broke out in a  storage warehouse of an industry for fine chemicals and laboratory reagents,1988-06-21 18:00:00,1988-06-21 00:00:00,"ENVIRONMENT AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Weather dry, settled, sunny and warn with ambient temperature of 22°C. Wind light, North Westerly.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A fire broke out on June 21 in the oxidising materials section of the Production Store building. The fire spread rapidly and violently, involving within minutes an external drum storage area where flammable liquids were stored. The fire took considerable resources and time to extinguish. During fire, two explosions occurred in the warehouse. Off-site damages were significant and a large number of residents were evacuated from their houses. Fears that large scale pollution of the environment would occur did not realise. No casualties occurred. Five firefighters attended hospital for minor treatment and a number of members of the public required attention following mishaps during the evacuation.More detailed information about the accident are shown on the Original Report together with three maps showing the surrounding area and the extent of the effects.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:Fire started in oxidising materials store when it was unoccupied, and spread to other parts of warehouse and outside drum storage compound.CAUSES:The Health and Safety Executive's investigation has not established the precise cause of the fire, but several valid hypotheses (such as the possible leakage of strongly corrosive substances onto organic materials, exothermic decomposition of stored materials and, less likely because it would have required two simultaneous failures, the mixing together of incompatible materials from spills or leaks) have been suggested. The rapidity of spread of the fire was due to a breakdown in good chemical warehousing practices in the factory which led to materials which were incompatible in a fire being stored together. Many of these materials were present as part of a procedure established by the company to ensure that chemicals that were surplus or off-specification to their own or their customer's requirements were disposed of in a satisfactory manner.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:5 firefighters attended hospital for minor treatment but they were not hospitalized. Outside the establishment, 3,000 people were evacuated. No one was injured but a number of people required attention, following mishaps during evacuation.MATERIAL LOSS:The chemical store was destroyed and the stored raw materials and finished products were lost. The cost of the material losses has been estimated in about 3.67 M Euros. Outside the establishment the adjacent public house were damaged by fire. Minor off-site missiles damages and widespread damages to glazing on buildings within about 100 m of the site.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The NorthWest wind caused smoke and fume to drifted towards the a small town.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Automatic fire alarm operated and the fire brigade intervened. Staff on-site was evacuated.&nbsp; A total of 19 pumps, 2 turntable ladders, 1 hydraulic platform, a foam tender, a breathing apparatus tender and control unit were involved, and up to 22 BA sets were in use at any one time, with over 140 individual wearings of sets. Firewater runoff retained almost entirely in on-site effluent treatment plant. EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Progressive implementation of pre-existing local emergency plan with precautionary evacuation of 3,000 local residents who might have been at risk from toxic components of smoke plume. The site was not subjected to the more stringent requirements arising under article 5 of Directive EEC/501/82 but the storage of petroleum spirit under license would be known to the emergency services and routine familiarization visits and logs of data held by them would in the circumstances provide a ready guide to the task that faced them. In that way, the generic ""all-hazard"" emergency off-site plans at County and District Government levels were brought into play and the smoothness of the precautionary evacuation bears tribute to the systems of emergency planning that was in place.No emergency measures are stille required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: Bulk chemical storage at the site has been discontinued. A series of notices under the 
Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 have been served to ensure that the company reviews its procedures for storage and disposal of chemicals, and that revised procedures and standards are adopted and followed if the store is rebuilt on this or other sites.Measures to mitigate consequences: Off-site clear-up was initiated and completed within a few weeks by staff of firm and specialist fire-fighting/clear-up team from firm's parent company. Off-site property damages have been repaired."

All plant sub-installations are concerned, except for biogas processing and biogas injection.The site was secured.The operator separated all the containers from heating, feeding and gas pipelines. The flare, the biogas processing (BGP) and biogas injection were shut down.","As far as is currently known, the cause is:The digester in question was filled with beet chips and biogas production fell sharply. As more hydrogen sulphide and hydrogen was produced, the container was separated from the system on 9 June 2016.Attempts were made to stimulate gas production by adding lime (to raise the pH value). This resulted in a large amount of foam being produced, which led to an increase in pressure in the digester. The pressure relief devices were probably overwhelmed and the foils on the digester were ruptured.Biogas and foaming fermentation substrate escaped from the digester.",Material damage to the gas accumulator roof.Release of biogas,"All substrate and gas pipelines shut off, stirrers turned off, site secured, flare and BGP switched off, personal protective equipment put on, site evacuated, fire brigade called, senior staff informed.

1062,519,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Ethylene release from the rupture of a burst disk in a plastic material plant,2005-07-21 14:17:00,2005-07-21 00:00:00,"In a plastic materials plant, a safety disc burst on the medium pressure return on a compressor; 3.2 t of ethylene was discharged into the atmosphere, the quantity of dangerous substances released lie more than 5% over the threshold defined by the Seveso Directive. The disc burst subsequent to a rise in back-pressure in the primary compressor. This was because, on 10/07, a leak was detected on a grease bottle bleed valve on the medium pressure return on line 42 in the polyethylene shop. The bottle was cooled pending repair. The line was stopped on 20/07 at 4 a.m. for the work, then brought back into operation at 6 p.m.&nbsp;The worker in charge started the primary compressor in accordance with the normal procedure, the pressure run-up was monitored in automatic mode. The pressure measured at the inlet to the secondary compressor was over 300 bar and a back-pressure relief valve on the primary compressor should have opened at 284 bar. Furthermore, the primary compressor should have been put on stand-down automatically at 270 bar, and was not. The worker in charge noted an abnormal rise in pressure and switched to manual mode. But this action was too late and did not prevent the pressure from rising to 310 bar, resulting in the disc bursting. The primary compressor did not go on stand-down because the pressure rise adjustment gauge was partially blocked up (measurement less than actual pressure). The pressure relief valve did not open due to a mistake by maintenance: when replacing pressure relief valves, a non-compliant relief valve (pressure set at over 310 bar) was installed. In addition, the obstruction of the medium pressure return section combined with several days' running without bleeding grease off increased the speed at which the pressure rose. ","The accident was due to the pressure being too high at the input to the secondary compressor. At over 300 bar, the pressure was due to the primary compressor not going to stand-down because the pressure rise adjustment gauge was partially blocked up (measurement less than actual pressure). Added to this, an unsuitable pressure relief valve failed to open (pressure set at over 310 bar).",no description available,"The plant was shut down, the non-return valve obstructed by low grade polymers was cleaned and checked, the automatic safety system and primary compressor's automatic stand-down sequence were tested and worked correctly. The burst disc and pressure relief valve were replaced.","The operator is taking several measures: the compressor can be put on stand-down in automatic or manual mode, back-up triggering by pressure measurement, the rules on using grease bottles are being reviewed to prevent the medium pressure returns from becoming blocked up, extra training for staff, inclusion of this type of blockage in the hazard survey.

1063,948,Major Accident,"Production, destruction and storage of explosives",Explosion in a simple base powders crushing building and preparation of nitrocellulose formulations,2014-03-07 17:35:00,2014-03-07 17:40:00,"An explosion occurred in a building in which nitrocellulose formulations were prepared, and recovered single-base powders crushed, for subsequent use in the process of manufacturing double-base spherical powders. (The process involves the manufacture in an aqueous medium of small spherical granules from fresh or recycled nitrocellulose prior to adding nitroglycerine.) Although the recovered powder crusher is not implicated in the accident, it was damaged as a result of the fire in the building. The formulations are made from granules recycled after sieving, crushed single-base recovered powders and fresh nitrocellulose in the form of nitrocotton fibres. To make the formulations, nitrocellulose granules of various origins, stored under water in tanks in the building where the accident occurred, are transferred between tanks in the neighbouring buildings and the tanks in this building via a network of piping fitted with centrifugal pumps. The nitrocellulose granules in the building in question are first pumped into a pycnometer tank to be weighed and then transferred to other decanting and formulation tanks located in the same building. The formulations produced in this way are then transferred, by pumping, to granulation tanks at a later stage in the production line, where they are dissolved in ethyl acetate. An explosion occurred in the transfer pump and the piping linking storage tank B5 with the pycnometer tank during the transfer of nitrocellulose granules in the medium of water between these tanks. The investigations showed that the explosion of wet single-base powder had created detonation conditions in the pump and the vertical pipes downstream of the pump. A quantity of powder estimated at between 10 kg and 30 kg was detonated in the accident. The detonation sheared open tanks B4 and B5 in the vicinity of the pump in question. Tank B5, contained granules recycled after sieving and was almost empty, spilled into a pit and the contents of tank B4, consisting of recovered powder in the form of monotubular grains, were partially discharged onto the building's concrete floor and were not involved in the explosive reaction. It is estimated that there were 6 tonnes of powder in tank B4 at the time of the explosion. The other tanks in the building and the pipe network were seriously damaged by the primary debris from the detonation of the pump and piping and by the blast wave. The explosion caused major damage to the building and threw debris out to a radius of 50 to 70 metres. Windows were broken within a radius of 100-150 metres. In the building affected, the explosion set off a fire in a store containing dry single-basis powder ready for feeding into the crusher.","The hypothesis that nitrocellulose in a water medium could burn and then detonate as a transition from combustion without being primed by another detonation was initially considered but then ruled out after testing. The detonation of the wet nitrocellulose granules must have been triggered by an initial detonation of dry material. It was concluded that the cause was a technical issue associated with the type of pump which had led to a possible temperature increase in the nitrocellulose granules after loss of prime and drainage of the pump chamber. The creation of a vortex in the tank upstream of the pump caused the pump to lose its prime, enabling the nitrocellulose granules in the pump to come back into contact with air and, in local areas, dry out. The hypothesis is that the dried powder trapped behind the pump impeller then became hot and detonated inside the pump chamber, transferring the detonation to the column of wet nitrocellulose located above the pump. The fact that the pipework upstream of the pump found after the explosion was not destroyed by an internal detonation supports the hypothesis that a vortex caused the pipes to be drained prior to the explosion. Hypotheses and deductions: 1) Vortex effect: It seems that the level of tank B5, to which the centrifugal pump was connected, was low at the time of the accident. In identical circumstances on earlier occasions operators had noticed a vortex effect at the bottom of the tank which could be the cause of air ingress into the pump, causing it to lose prime. During tests to try to recreate the circumstances of the accident, the operator noted: - a 50°C increase in the (surface) temperature of the pump within 15 minutes; - that the liquid column downstream of the pump failed to empty. Thus, since there is no longer a flow of liquid to the vertical column but only an oscillating phenomenon caused by intermittent discharge of the unprimed pump, the solid particles tend to drop to the bottom of the column, near the pump, where they form a blockage that stops liquid flowing back into the pump and keeping the product residues in the pump wet. 2) Sequence of events: It is hypothesised that the following sequence of events led to the accident: - Air ingress caused by a vortex led to the pump losing prime, obstructing the movement of the product through the pipes and a blockage forming in the column downstream, preventing liquid flowing back. The lack of liquid flow combined with the presence of air caused the pump to heat up and, in local areas, dry out the nitrocellulose. At the same time, nitrocellulose particles dropped into the column downstream of the pump. - The nitrocellulose particles inside the pump became drier in local areas, caught fire and detonated, causing a second detonation of the wet powder in the downstream piping. ","The explosion caused serious damage to the building and threw debris out to a radius of 50 to 70 metres. Windows were broken within a radius of 100-150 metres. The explosion started a fire. Two operators who were working at the rear of the building at the time of the explosion and protected from the primary blast by a brick wall managed to escape. During evacuation, one of the two operators sustained a minor injury to the hand. Both operators were taken to hospital and were discharged to return home the same evening. ","The internal emergency teams intervened very quickly and started to fight the fire which broke out after the explosion. The external emergency services arrived very quickly on the scene. Set up of a post-accident crisis unit comprising the fire brigade, the police, the municipality, the Governor, civil protection, a communication unit and the competent Seveso inspection services (FPS [Federal Public Service] Economy, RAM [Major Accident Risk] cell of SPW [Service Public de Wallonie]). Clean-up work and site security operations were organised in cooperation with a French company specialised in decommissioning and dismantling pyrotechnic facilities. The situation immediately after the accident may be described as follows. - According to estimates, there were still 6 tonnes of nitrocellulose granules in the building, partially spread on the ground, plus 18 tonnes in the vertical tanks, in the pit or trapped in the piping. - On the ground floor of the building, parts of the floor were covered with nitrocellulose granules mixed with a great deal of debris and rubble. - The building had been severely damaged: only the metal structure remained and this was in very poor condition. - In the event of the remaining nitrocellulose exploding, the effects could extend beyond the site and affect people living in the neighbourhood. The following urgent action was taken: - Saturating with water (drenching) was recommended, considering the fire risk - and even explosion risk - on account of the powder remaining on the ground and in the atmosphere. To that end, an internal fire team attended continuously for 8 weeks to ensure watering. - In agreement with the authorities, a site clearance procedure has been established: Stage 1: reducing the quantity of powder spilt and hence limit the likelihood of its reacting by: - continuous daily hosing of the powder on the ground; - filling the vertical tanks with water; - monitoring of water levels; - isolation of all networks into and out of the building (overhead and underground). Stage 2: Organise the manual collection and packing of the powder spread on the ground. This has been a very gradual operation, organised per areas of a few square metres following risk assessments based on photos of the areas in question and subject to work permits. The powder is recovered using an aluminium shovel and water-filled containers. Stage 3: Securing of walls and building framework at risk of falling before further work on site. Stage 4: Drainage of tanks. Stage 5: Treatment of pipes containing powder. Stage 6: Collection of remaining waste on the ground. Stage 7: Dismantling of the building. After obtaining a technical opinion from external experts, and in agreement with the authorities, a 350 m security perimeter was set up. Local residents were evacuated during the clearing and cleaning of the industrial site commencing at noon on 13 March, 6 days after the explosion. After one week, the security perimeter could be reduced as the risk of explosion could be ruled out thanks to the safety measures put in place. Site clearing and remediation works are still ongoing three months after the explosion.",The investigation has not yet been finalised and the causes have not been fully identified. Lessons and immediate steps: Replacement of the company's electrical centrifugal pumps (40 in total) with Venturi-type pumps. Venturi pumps operate on the principle of aspiration of the fluid to be conveyed by means of negative pressure brought about by the movement of a motive fluid (water). This type of pump means that friction can be reduced and the product conveyed can be kept wet continuously since the motive fluid is water.

Decontamination was performed on the buildings and grounds of the plant and on 2 buildings located 250 m from the plant. A plan for eliminating PCB containing material is set up. The authorisation for the progressive start-up of the plant, 15 days after the accident, was issued by prefect basing on the documentation on the works performed and relating expert advice presented by the operator. Limitations concerning the off-site area were lifted after 25 days.Epidemiological monitoring during a year of the affected persons is foreseen.","The accident scenario ""fire of a transformer"" had not been considered in the safety report made in 1992, probably because this kind of material is present in many sites and thus it is someway a bit trivialised. Nevertheless these transformers are subject to risk prevention regulations concerning PCB.The lack of knowledge by the personnel concerning the precise characteristics of the transformers has delayed the assessment of the chemical risk by the emergency response service.Protection measures have been set up only belatedly. These measures have been taken only after the fire had been extinguished, in reason of the fact that the event was notified to the competent authorities only two hours after the fire had been put under control.In this kind of event, where the entire public service system is concerned by the response measures, it is essential to work in synergy. This allows to gain time and avoids to double efforts in the same research area."

connecting a large storage tank installation and a ship bunker
installation was detected.
The 20 years old pipeline presented a damaged area of approx. 2 mm
diameter. This damaged area was located on the bottom side of the
pipeline, and was clearly caused by external corrosion, which had been
facilitated by a not heated isolation system and by the use of a
standard pipe wall thickness.","About 20 cubic metres of polluted ground were removed and replaced. Since at the time of the incident the groundwater level was very high, almost no Diesel-oil was absorbed by the ground.
The ground pollution caused costs for about 7500 EURO (seventhousand five hundred EURO).","As an immediate measure, the supply of the pipeline-section involved was immediately shut off, and a clamp was applied to the pipeline. By other immediate measures (use of vehicles carrying suction devices, absorber oil barriers, shutting-off the drainage ditch), the spreading of the Diesel fuel-oil (approx. 3000 l) could be limited to ca. 50 square metres.","All drainage points along the pipelines (those in use for naphtha, straight run gasoline) should be isolated and protected against corrosion, in order to stop external corrosion.

1069,429,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Fire during maintenance work on the piping supplying gasoline tanks,1991-06-14 11:24:00,1991-06-14 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
A fire started at the man-hole of an inspection pit for underground pipes of a petroleum storage depot during maintenance work on the piping supplying the tank No 2. The underground pipes were feeding eleven tanks in different conditions (empty but not degassified, half empty, full, empty and degassified, empty). Maintenance work started on June 11 (hot work-permit had been ordinarily issued on June 10 and the pipes were empty).  When the fire started, the water emulsion in the tank basins became yellow and ignited resulting in fire. The alarm was sounded and all valves were automatically closed (it required about 14 minutes). Soon after, the power supply was also interrupted. After inspection, all accessible valves were found to be closed and therefore rapid extinguishing of the fire was to be expected. Instead, the phenomenon repeated various times that afternoon and the flames were extinguished by the personnel quickly. There was an unsuccessful attempt to extinguish the fire by covering the inspection pit with sand. The fire escalated but the personnel in collaboration with the fire brigade managed to confine it within the tank dike by applying foam using foam monitors. At about 15:20 an explosion occurred and, even if all people thought it was tank No 76, the explosion was caused by two acetylene bottles used in the maintenance works. Finally, it was found that a valve of tank No 1 (full of gasoline) had been opened (for reasons not clarified) and it was releasing gasoline with a rate of 150 m3/h. The fire was extinguished at 15:40 (about 4.5 hours after it started). To extinguish the fire, about 43,000 litres of foam (from storage depot, local fire brigade, etc.), that is about 717 m3 of water, were used. The whole amount of water used in extinguish the fire and cooling the nearby tanks (about 1,500 m3) was collected and treated according to the degree of pollution established after the analysis for BOD5, COD and hydrocarbons. Monitoring of the underground channels revealed no pollution.","CAUSES:
The most probable hypothesis is that, during the maintenance work, the man-hole of the inspection pit was put again in place but only one bolt was tightened. On June 14, the inlet valve of tank No 1 was opened for an unknown reason and the gasoline contained in the tank escaped with a flow of 150 m3/h. The flow could have lifted the cover of the man-hole allowing the release of gasoline.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 15 firemen were burned during the accident: 2 of them were badly hurt, 5 seriously and 8 slightly. The firemen were burned due to a gust of wind and for the cylinders' explosion. Outside the establishment two people (a photo reporter and a journalist) were injured but not for the effects of the fire or of the explosion. The photo reporter fell down by a roof and the journalist was injured by a fire fighting piping.MATERIAL LOSS:Damages of some fire fighting equipment of the fire brigade, destruction of the railways and of three wagons of the SNCF. As far as it concerns the depot:&nbsp; tank No 2 was deformed; tanks No 1 and 3 had traces of burning in the upper side; tank No 76 was damaged at the heat insulator; tanks No 76 and 78 had slight damages at the heat insulator; tank No 93 had traces of burning in the upper side and shows some point of impact due to the fragments of the acetylene cylinders (without perforation).The joints of the pipings placed on the left side were burned.ECOLOGICAL HARM:Soot and particulates were emitted for about 4 hours but no toxic gas emission occurred. Floating barriers have been precautionally employed but the fire water used was collected and treated according to the degree of pollution established after the analysis for BOD5, COD and hydrocarbons. Monitoring of the underground channels revealed no pollution.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The traffic was interrupted. Evacuation of the closer buildings (less than 200 people) and of the offices and factories (about 700 people) located back to the storage depot on the Seine river.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the fire started, the alarm was sounded and all valves were automatically closed (it required about 14 minutes). Soon after, the power supply was also interrupted. The activation of the cooling of nearby tanks was activated.

1070,547,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Release to a bounded area of phenol caused by the erroneous overfilling of a tank,2001-01-13 10:13:00,2001-01-13 12:23:00,"Phenol storage tank overfilled losing approximately 14 tonnes to a
bunded area. Greater than 5% of the qualifying quantity of a dangerous
substance.Comments: The establishment is a COMAH Lower-Tier site, which is wholly contained within a COMAH Top-Tier site.Meteorological conditions - Remarks: Other than above, conditions were dry, frosty and still. The ambient temperature caused solidification of the lost inventory within the bund with no immediate risk to people or environment.Wind speed: 1.00, Wind direction: North West, Wind stability: A, Temperature: 5.00Discussion about the Occurrence:The plant had two phenol stock tanks; a larger storage tank (40 tonnes capacity) and a smaller process feed stock tank (18 tonnes capacity). The larger stock tank received road tanker deliveries and phenol needed for the process was transferred to the smaller tank in 12 tonne lots. Process phenol was then continuously circulated between the manufacturing plant and the smaller tank. The level in each tank was measured by load cells informing high weight alarms on the control panel. Shortly after a tanker delivery, the smaller (18 tonne) tank was topped up and the transfer system was set by an operator to circulate phenol for the process. However, the circulation was incorrectly set. This resulted in the closure of the smaller tank outlet and the pumping of phenol from the larger storage tank to the plant and then back into the smaller tank, which gradually overflowed into the bund. As the top-up had just been done, the panel operators had acknowledged a high weight alarm and did not spot the over-filling until the tank overflowed into the bund around it.The operator wrongly positioned valving which set the system up to take phenol from the larger storage tank, circulate it to the manufacturing plant and back into the smaller tank. The outlet of the latter had been closed hence it gradually filled up and passed out of the overflow into the bund.Had the pump mode been correctly selected for transferring to the manufacturing plant, the limt switch on the&nbsp; larger storage tank outlet valve would have been enabled and would have prevented the transfer pump operating, but&nbsp; the pump mode was incorrectly set, by-passing this interlock.Since level measurement relied on load cells, the panel operators' understanding of plant status was flawed. Just prior to the incident phenol had been transferred from the larger storage tank to the smaller (from which the manufacturing plant was supplied). The high weight alarm had been used to judge when sufficient phenol had been transferred and the alarm had been acknowledged. Not enough phenol had been used up by the manufacturing process for the weight in the smaller tank to drop and hence for the alarm to reset. Thus as the smaller tank was filling up the panel operators did not notice it.The investigation found that the mix of automated and manual systems for controlling the pump mode, switching and valve settings was vulnerable to human error.The establishment is a COMAH Lower-Tier site, which is wholly contained within a COMAH Top-Tier site.","As shown in section 3, it was important to ensure that the pump mode switch was correctly selected and that valving was set to the correct position.

Shortly after a tanker delivery, the smaller (18 tonne) tank was topped up and the transfer system was set by an operator to circulate phenol for the process. However, the circulation was incorrectly set. This resulted in the closure of the smaller tank outlet and the pumping of phenol from the larger storage tank to the plant and then back into the smaller tank, which gradually overflowed into the bund. As the top-up had just been done, the panel operators had acknowledged a high weight alarm and did not spot the over-filling until the tank overflowed into the bund around it.

The investigation found that the mix of automated and manual systems for controlling the pump mode, switching and valve settings was vulnerable to human error.&nbsp; Poor design of safeguards relying on indirect measurement of level in storage tanks and manual intervention to correctly position both valving and pump mode (the latter from a remote location) left the system vulnerable to human error.
The establishment is a
COMAH Lower-Tier site, which is wholly contained within a COMAH
Top-Tier site. The COMAH Lower-Tier operator engages the staff of its
host COMAH Top-Tier operator to run the plant to the host's operating
environmental and safety management procedures. The host site's
emergency procedures were applied to the incident and dealt with it
without problem. This operator's MAPP addresses the issues around the
incident, but the operating procedures were not sufficiently explicit,
as there was no system for avoiding human error and the hardware safety
systems were easy to defeat. No actual environmental impact.
","The ambient temperature was such that the phenol solidified in the bund with no adverse consequences for the environment or human safety.The greatest risk was to those engaged in physically removing the solidified phenol from the bund. A detailed risk assessment and method statement&nbsp; was needed to ensure that&nbsp; they were protected against the chemical risk during clear up and when removing their personal protective equipment. The risk of spreading any contamination had to be taken into account, as did the physical effects of working strenuously in full chemical protection suitsMaterial Loss:
The losses comprised&nbsp; lost material, costs for disposal of waste
phenol, cost of contractors to assist clean up and&nbsp; sundry items of
equipment for clean up. 
Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","Due to the toxic risk, the solid phenol was chiselled out of the bund by staff in full personal protective equipment, in accordance with a detailed risk assessment and method statement. Special precautions were taken to avoid personal contamination when removing the protective equipment.The material removed was drummed to await safe disposal in accordance with waste disposal legislation.Official action taken - legal action: An Improvement Notice was issued: the investigation found that the operator had reviewed safety systems and had identified the shortcomings, but had not completed improvements to the phenol storage facility that would have prevented this accident. The safety system review found other shortcomings elsewhere on the plant so the Notice required a detailed prioritised action plan to be developed building on the review and setting timescales for upgrades to all of the relevant plant safety systems.		Official action taken - other official action: Further inspection visits will be paid to ensure compliance with the action plan required by the Improvement Notice.
Discussion about response: The operator was responsive and concerned. However, this was the second incident within a year that had involved the mix of manual and automatic systems, indirect measurement of plant condition giving operators a false impression of plant status, and the lack of a system requiring operators to confirm that they have taken correct action. The operator had acknowledged these shortcomings and was addressing them when this incident occurred. However, there was still the lack of a site-wide strategy for improvements. An Improvement Notice was issued requiring a detailed prioritised action plan to be developed building on the safety system review and setting timescales for upgrades to all of the relevant plant safety systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improvements to the phenol storage will include soft-wired alarms linked to the load cells to inform panel operators and to trip out the transfer pump at tank Hi-level. Float switch operated level sensors will be provided as part of a hard-wired interlock to the transfer pump, stopping pumping at Hi-hi level.","Immediate lessons: The mix of automated and manual systems were
vulnerable to human error. There was not adequate confirmation of
correct actions.
The poor design of the level measurement system (by indirect means)
gave control panel operators, remote from the storage facility, a false
impression of the state of the plant.
Re-design of safety systems required with direct level measurement and
hard-wired interlocking to the transfer pump.
Measures to prevent recurrence: An Improvement Notice was issued as the investigation found that although the operator had reviewed safety systems and had identified the shortcomings, they had not completed improvements to the phenol storage facility that would have prevented this accident. The safety system review found other shortcomings elsewhere on the plant so the Notice required a detailed prioritised action plan to be developed building on the review and setting timescales for upgrades to all of the relevant plant safety systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improvements to the phenol storage will include soft-wired alarms linked to the load cells to inform panel operators and to trip out the transfer pump at tank Hi-level.

Fire in a coating plant
A fire broke out at a coating plant owned by Abloy in the city of Joensuu&nbsp; in Finland on the 30th January 2009.
The electrolytic coating section was completely destroyed. The surrounding area was evacuated in a radius of 0,5 km. It was suspected that&nbsp; water containing dangerous chemicals have leaked to the surrounding area. During the fire several chemicals in the plant mixed together and formed poisonous gases. 
Authorities are investigating&nbsp; the fire.","The probable cause of the fire was the overheating of a bus bar connection. There were a lot of flammable materials (plastics) near the bus bar connections, which prompted the ignition after the overheating. The flammable materials (plastic tunnels surrounding the chemical containers) were there to prevent the spread of the evaporated chemicals into the air. The bus bar connections hadn't been tightened, cleaned or checked since the plant was built in 2001. Because of the large amount of flammable materials the fire spread really rapidly.
The enterprise&nbsp;had not realized that the bus bars can pose a risk when operating the plant. The bus bar connections were not included in the maintenance program. When planning the surface treatment plant, the possible faults in the bus bars were not taken into account.","One worker was taken to hospital for a check-up.
Water containing dangerous acidic chemicals leaked into the surrounding area. During the fire, several chemicals in the plant mixed together and formed poisonous gases.
The electrolytic coating section was completely destroyed. The total losses have not been published but they were at least 2 million euros.
The whole plant was closed down for several days and the coating section was out of use for a little over a year while it was being re-planned and rebuilt. The coating operation was transferred to another city in the country.","
The amount of water used to put out the fire was approximately 2,200 m3. The surrounding area was evacuated within a radius of 0.5 km.","All electrical connections in the plant, especially the copper and aluminium bus bar connections should be maintained on a regular basis. It is recommended that fire-retardant materials and components are used throughout the plant."

1073,1154,Major Accident,Chemical installations ,Release of sulfur trioxide from a pipeline in a tank storage facility,2019-01-07 11:10:00,2019-01-07 14:30:00,"On 7 January 2019, at around 11:10 a.m., a substance leaked in the tank store of a production plant. The leak occurred from a pipeline between a storage container in the tank store and the production plant.
The substance that leaked was oleum 65%. This is concentrated sulfuric acid in which sulfur trioxide is dissolved. The substance reacts violently with water, causes severe chemical burns and can irritate the respiratory tract. Due to the cold, wet weather conditions, a fog formed around the site of the leak. The wind speed was about 0.2 m/s, so the fog occurred only in the vicinity of the leak site.
At around 10:45, the transfer of oleum from a railway tank wagon began. For this operation, a vehicle of the on-site fire brigade is on standby at the transfer point in order to be able to intervene immediately in the event of any leakage. For this reason, the leak, which was not linked to the unloading operation, was quickly detected and remedial action was taken immediately. After the leak was detected, the transfer process was stopped and damage limitation measures started.
The site fire brigade was alerted and precipitated the fog with several fire monitors and water curtains. The competent authorities (professional fire brigade, Darmstadt Regional Council, police and waterway police) were informed of the event by fax at 11:28. In this report, the event was classified as reporting level D 2 (impacts outside the factory boundaries cannot be ruled out). In addition, the Frankfurt professional fire brigade was asked to assist. Using additional water monitors, it supported the factory fire brigade in precipitating the fog. A total of five water monitors, one extinguishing support vehicle and three water curtains were used.
In parallel with the on-site operation, a team was set up in the Site Situation Centre to provide coordinated information for the press and to advise the public via a helpline. Representatives of the Frankfurt professional fire brigade and the police were also present in this team.
At 11:51 a.m., the reporting level was increased to D 3 (risk likely or already present outside the factory boundaries) due to the emergence of a light wind and the public was warned by the sirens installed at the plant. Staff in neighbouring warehouses were instructed to vacate their premises.
Most of the water used to precipitate the leak was collected in the tank storage facility’s collection area. Water that fell outside the collecting basin entered a sewer via the surface drainage system, which drains into the municipal sewer. The outlet to the municipal sewer was shut and the water was thus retained on site. After analyses showed no pH change and no significant sulfate contamination, the water was pumped from the collecting basin and sewer to the site’s biological waste water treatment plant via the chemical waste collecting system.
The firm drained the contents of the pipeline in question into a storage container and the pipe was rinsed with sulfuric acid. This made it possible to stop the fog formation at around 13.00. It was established that the leak occurred at a pressure measuring device. After the fog formation ceased, staff of the site fire brigade wearing chemical protective suits replaced the defective measuring instrument with a new device. The subsequent pressure test of the pipe confirmed that the installation was leak-tight.
After the successful pressure test, the professional fire brigade gave the all-clear via the sirens at 14:27 and ended the operation. A total of 26 on-site fire brigade and 55 professional fire brigade staff took part in the deployment.
In the course of the operation, the footbridge passing through the plant near the tank storage facility and the road to the north of the plant were closed by the police.
The environmental monitoring team of the Frankfurt professional fire brigade carried out measurements of air in and around the plant during the release of the substance and after the leak had ended. None of the measurements detected a concentration hazardous to health.
Representatives of the Darmstadt Regional Government Office and fire safety inspectorate enquired by telephone and on site about the event and the measures taken.
It was estimated that no more than 100 kg of sulfur trioxide had leaked.
During the deployment, there were no reports of injuries within the plant either among staff or among firefighters. However, the response team received one report of a child developing a cough outside the plant.
On 8 January 2019, the Darmstadt Regional Government Office and the Criminal Police enquired about the event. In the course of these discussions it was agreed, amongst other things, that the defective component would be sent to the manufacturer in order to determine the cause of the defect.",A subsequent examination of the defective pressure measuring device revealed that the membrane that seals the measuring instrument off from the product space was defective and thus the substance escaped into the environment. The measuring equipment was installed in May 2016 and tested on 22 November 2017 as part of the testing of the pipeline in accordance with the Industrial Safety Ordinance.,"Release of sulfur trioxide (100 kg). During the deployment, there were no reports of injuries within the plant either among staff or among firefighters. However, the response team received one report of a child developing a cough outside the plant.",See Accident Description.,Have a vehicle of the on-site fire brigade on standby at the transfer point in order to be able to intervene immediately and take remedial action quickly in the event of any leakage.

No fire or injuries. No plant damage or environmental harm. Release exceeds 5% of qualifying inventory for Ethylene Oxide.An Ethylene Oxide tanker was being loaded at the bulk Ethylene Oxide storage tanks. This was a routine operation with approximately 24 tankers loaded that same day. Sieger gas detector in bund alarmed plus high level alarm to knock out pot located in the bund - both alarms and DCS panel in nearby control room. Ethylene Oxide was discovered overflowing from the knock out pot to the bund central drain gulley. The tanker loading meanwhile stopped (trip system) due to metered amount (18 tonnes) through system. It was found on weighing the tanker that the load was 4 tonnes less than expected.The release was caused by a spring operated hand valve not closing and allowing a path from the nitrogen vent line on the loading pipework to the knock out pot. The pot was not designed to take large quantities of liquid and hence overflowed to bund. The release was contained in the bund and disposed of by controlled dilution with water to the main site drains. There were no injuries and no ignition of the release which was contained within the central gully of the bund (reduced surface area for pool) and was refrigerated material.,"The failure of a hand operated valve allowed a route for Ethylene Oxide to enter the vent system. The Knock out pot was not designed to handle large amounts of liquid and hence overflowed.
N.B The vent system is a safety feature to allow depressurisation of flexible hoses after transfer. The spring loaded hand valve was designed to close i.e. cannot be left in open position.
Follows CIA guidance on bulk handling of Ethylene Oxide.
Unable to replicate the valve failure. Improvements may be made to instrumented protection and human factors issues.","No injuries, plant damage or environmental effects. No involvement by emergency services.","The release was contained in the main storage bund drain. There was less likelihood of a pool fire due to containment and the temperature of Ethylene Oxide, which was in refrigerated storage.The release was diluted &gt;100:1 with water to reduce the flammable risk and was sent to the main site drain.Emergency measures - Remarks: The release was dealt with by on-site personnel in a controlled manner.Official action taken - other official action: Letter sent to the company.",Immediate lessons: Additional manual valve in vent line. Operating procedures changed. Further investigation underway.Measures to prevent recurrence: Trip system to transfer pump on high level in knock out pot. Improved communications between the tanker loading operator and the control room/plant operators. Review the risk assessment in terms of human factors.

The first explosion appears to have originated in building C. According to the information available, the plant was manufacturing fireworks to be used in displays to be put on in the surrounding area as part of local summer festivities. Another explosion (the third) took place a few minutes after the second one.","The expert witnesses appointed by the public prosecutor’s office and the company to ascertain the causes and dynamics of the accident are currently performing their investigations. To enable this, the plant has been cordoned off. According to the information received from the competent rescue units of the fire brigade, ‘based on information obtained immediately after the event, it appears that work was taking place in the area housing the hydraulic press when the explosion took place, and a van was parked in the area opposite, presumably loaded with fireworks — it was completely destroyed in the accident’. According to the legal representative of the plant operator, with input from the expert witness, the explosion may have been caused by a spark generated by a discharge of electrostatic energy that had built up on a worker’s clothing or on bags containing the raw materials awaiting processing in the hydraulic press area. It is argued that, given the fact that the accident took place at 13:40 in the month of July, the weather conditions (high temperature, low humidity) may have contributed to this accumulation of electrostatic energy.&nbsp; The plant’s representative has also stated that the surveillance footage from within the establishment shows that the first explosion took place in building C (workshop and hydraulic press) and that burning fragments (from finished fireworks present in the area) were launched in the direction of the other buildings reachable in a straight line from building C, causing a domino effect. The roofs of the affected buildings, which, in accordance with applicable legislation, had been designed to channel the force of the blast upwards in the event of an explosion inside, would not have been capable of protecting the products within those buildings from the impact of those burning fragments. The role, if any, of the van found destroyed in the area facing building C (figures 4 and 5 in the Confidential section) remains unclear, though it is ‘very likely that it was directly affected by the explosion, since it marked one of the points of the crater and had been completely blown apart by the blast’ (fire brigade report of 10&nbsp;July 2014).","The explosion virtually destroyed the entire plant, except for buildings I, E and TPF, which were damaged to a lesser extent (see figure 6). Three people were taken to hospital with burns and injuries of varying severity; two were discharged on the same day and were expected to recover soon afterwards and the third was admitted to hospital with second-degree burns and fractures, although his condition was not considered to be life-threatening. Another three employees were found dead at the scene: one was found between buildings I (canopy-covered structure) and D (compound warehouse), while the other two victims were found under the rubble of building C (the workshop and hydraulic press). The shell of a van, completely destroyed and with evidence that an explosion had taken place inside it, was found in the area opposite building C (workshop and hydraulic press). Other vehicles used to transport raw materials and products around the plant were also found damaged in different parts of the plant. Fragments (concrete fragments and unexploded devices) were found across a radius of approximately 500&nbsp;m. The projection of incendiary fragments after the explosion caused fires to start in the scrubland surrounding the plant (figures 7 and 8). The explosion was felt beyond the plant&rsquo;s immediate surroundings, as far as homes in the nearest urban centres.&nbsp;","The competent local fire brigade, ambulance service, carabinieri, municipal police, National Forestry Corps, military explosives experts and the main local authorities (regional and municipal authorities, Prefecture and prosecution service) got involved immediately. Given the nature and timing of the event, it would not have been feasible to manage the emergency internally. Local people who saw and felt the effects of the explosions called the fire brigade to report the accident and firefighters were promptly dispatched. The intervention basically consisted of searching for missing persons and putting out fires in vehicles and scrubland both on and off the plant premises, taking the necessary precautions given that unexploded fireworks were present. Once notified of the accident, the competent authority activated its External Emergency Plan.&nbsp; As part of the activities carried out under this plan, inter-institutional meetings were held for a joint assessment of the event and to decide on further steps to be taken. Staff from the Prefecture took part in these meetings.&nbsp;
At a dedicated meeting held on 10&nbsp;July 2014 at the offices of the local authority, it was decided, in view of an assessment of the situation, that none of the additional measures possible under the External Emergency Plan would need to be activated, so the emergency was declared over. However, as agreed at a subsequent meeting, supervision and clean-up work continued in the area.","In the report entitled Risk assessment report: major accident risks and the consequences of major accidents (August 2010), the plant operator concluded that a hypothetical explosion in building B or G would be fatal (0.14&nbsp;bar) at a distance of up to 173&nbsp;m, cause irreversible injuries (0.07&nbsp;bar) up to 281&nbsp;m and cause reversible injuries (0.03&nbsp;bar) up to&nbsp;533 m. The owner of the fireworks business is under investigation for multiple counts of manslaughter and criminal negligence resulting in a major accident. The plant area was ordered to be cordoned off. The plant’s safety management system was audited in 2012, revealing major technical and management weaknesses with regard to safety issues. These weaknesses, with specific reference to health and safety for the protection of workers, were also highlighted by the local health authority following its inspection of safety conditions at the business.
The proceedings are ongoing and the expert witnesses appointed by the parties have not yet submitted their reports."
1076,1018,Major Accident,Production of basic organic chemicals,cyclohexane leak (20 ton) to internal rain water sewage system,2011-02-28 09:00:00,2011-02-28 16:00:00,"During a draining operation of a cyclohexane storage tank, an operator left the valve open. A large quantity (20 tonnes) of cylohexane went to a containment designed to separate occasional leakfluids and rainwater. Normally the cylohexane is then pumped away but due to a failed leveldetector in the containment this didn't happen and the cylclohexane could get into a containment where all waste water gets together and is then treated. Because the cyclohexane is lighter than the waste water it flew over the top of the containment instead of being pumped to the waste water treatment installation. So the cylcohexane got into the internal rain water collection system and could spread further. Eventually the problem was detected by a TOC measurement device just before the valve that gives access to the the effluent point into the habour docks. When the leak was detected everything was done to prevent an explosion and the cylohexane could be recuperated out of the sewer system and even be used again in the installations.",The operator left a valve open and the containment system didn't function properly due to failed equipment and design mistakes.,Loss of cyclohexane.​Contamination of on site rainwater collection systems with cyclohexane.To prevent ignition on site traffic was stopped until the cyclohexane was removed.No off site consequences.,"All traffic was prohibited in the affected area, the cylohexane was removed.",The operator could have been better trained for draining operations. A better risk analysis might have detected the unsuitable design of the containment for cylohexane drainage. Testing the level detection or having a redundant system might have avoided its failing.

Two phase (gas and liquid) flow into scrubber and subsequent reaction
led to rupture of scrubber and release of reaction products (sulphur
dioxide and hydrogen chloride).
","The SDC transfer was the first at the start of a new process.  The plant had been flushed with monochlorbenzene (MCB) during commissioning.  However, unknown to the operating company, one drum of the newly supplied (from Poland) MCB was significantly contaminated with water.The cause of the unexpected reaction (SDC/water) in the measure vessel was not evaluated during the HAZOP prior to start up as a reliance was placed on the supplier to provide MCB to specification.Establishment is a

1078,1106,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"Release of substances, explosion and subsequent fire at a refinery",2018-09-01 05:00:00,2018-09-01 05:00:00,"On 1 September 2018, at approximately 5:11, a large amount of flammable liquid (light cracked petrol (LCP), boiling range 20-140 °C) was released spontaneously at a refinery site.The cause of the release was a crack in the container wall.
At the time the event occurred, the installation was operating normally.The reactor’s internal pressure was approximately 24 bar, the internal temperature ranged from approximately 130 °C to approximately 148 °C and the flow rate of the feedstock LCP was approximately 32 t/h (immediately before the event, at approximately 5:05, the flow rate was increased from 30.8 t/h to 32 t/h). All in all, the reactor’s operating parameters immediately prior to the event do not show any anomalies, in particular any increase in pressure or temperature.
As the reactor is designed to have a pressure of 38 bar at 300 °C, the above-mentioned operating parameters at the time of the event do not indicate that the reactor was overloaded.
Due to the release temperature (130-148 °C, which is partially above the boiling point of components of the feedstock LCP), a large cloud of explosive vapours immediately formed. The solvent vapours were mixed with air by the horizontal air coolers in the area of release and blown upwards. The rising explosive vapour cloud was ignited at height, presumably on the uninsulated hot surface of one of the installation’s columns (outside of the hazardous area).An explosion occurred, causing the significant quantity of flammable liquid present on the ground to ignite into a large fire. Although the release of the petrol vapours was detected by the gas sensors in the processing plant, the vapour cloud explosion occurred immediately afterwards (rapid sequence of events).
As a result of the explosion and resulting fire, in a neighbouring installation (an ether installation) another reactor also ruptured and the product (mainly butylene) was consumed by fire (or by a smaller explosion).&nbsp;This installation is still closed off by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, so the cause has not yet been confirmed.&nbsp;
Presumably, the first explosion shifted/deformed an air cooler in the ether installation in such a way that pipes connected to it were deformed (a pipe with a safety valve or a flare line, as the case may be), the pressure safeguards were no longer sufficient and the reactor ‘burst’ due to excess pressure or heat as a result of the intense fire surrounding it.
The on-site fire brigade and other emergency and rescue services that were called to the scene fought the large fire resulting from the explosion and the release of a large amount of flammable liquid and prevented the fire from spreading to other refinery installations and storage tanks. The above-mentioned second (‘smaller’) explosion occurred shortly after the emergency services arrived on site.
As a result of the explosion and resulting fire, multiple installations were destroyed or seriously damaged and rendered unusable. Buildings on the refinery site (including a control room and a fire station) were also destroyed or seriously damaged. Damage to approximately 100&nbsp;buildings in the surrounding area was also reported. Due to the large amount of smoke produced, approximately 1800&nbsp;people were evacuated from the refinery’s surroundings.
In total, approximately 30&nbsp;people were on site at the time of the event.
Eighteen people were injured, six of whom had to be hospitalised. Several people were given psychological care.
The emergency services took immediate and effective action to prevent the fire from spreading.
The on-site fire brigade, which was first on the scene, immediately called on other emergency services from the surrounding area. Up to 600 emergency and rescue personnel were on site.
No additional emergency measures in response to the event were required. After the event, the accumulated firewater was assessed in accordance with VdS&nbsp;2557 and in line with the requirements of TRwS&nbsp;779.
Safety measure:

Gas detection system was triggered. An explosion then occurred, resulting in a fire. Emergency shutdown of the plant was triggered. Firefighting efforts by fire services.
Restoration of on-site fire brigade’s operational readiness.
Process plants close to border with other systems isolated (exception: flare system in operation).
Residual contents of the damaged installations were released to the flare system or emptied into the slop system.
Static testing of buildings was carried out.
Safety systems worked effectively with regard to the incident.

The release of the product from the reactor in this magnitude is a ‘Major incident despite preventative measures’, for which no further safety measures are expected. In this case, the emergency plan / security plan and the special civil protection plan were activated. The resulting measures were effective.","The cause of the failure of the container wall has not yet been established. Tests being carried out by the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing on container samples have not yet been completed, but should confirm whether material defects, corrosion or mechanical damage could have caused the incident. There are no indications that unauthorised operation of the installation, deficiencies in safety management, operating errors or lack of staff training were to blame.","Impact within the area of operation:Damage to process plants, buildings, infrastructure.&nbsp;Overall costs: EUR 779,000,000
Soil contamination, groundwater contamination.Overall costs: EUR 25,000,000
12 injured (outpatient) / 6 hospitalised
Impact outside the area of operation:Window panes, roller doors, garage doors (business; private individuals).Overall costs: EUR 4,900,000","Firefighting; Safety of persons and plant communication with the authorities.The measures were triggered as a result of the activation of the gas sensors. External support staff and the authorities were informed via the integrated control centre. The measures taken were effective.
Within the operational area, safety measures, clean-up operations and a damage assessment were carried out.Outside the operational area, damage to property was recorded, assessed and remedied.
To prevent water contamination, the firewater was collected and temporarily stored, and then processed via the waste water plant. A mobile firewater purification plant was put into operation.
Fire-fighting and security work; communication with the authorities; evacuation operations; measurements in the surrounding area.Population alerted; road closures.
Approximately 2,000 inhabitants of the surrounding area evacuated by voluntary fire brigades.","In order to better protect individuals during similar events, the procedure to be followed in the event of a gas alarm has been adapted. In future, the systems will be evacuated on a large scale and a remote diagnosis will be carried out to assess the event and take further measures.
In order to better understand the extent and magnitude of such events, the number of gas sensors in the relevant areas will be increased.
The operability of the on-site fire brigade’s control room and fire station will in future be organised in such a way that they remain fully operational even in the event of major damaging events.
Following the event, a procedural plan was developed in consultation with the competent authorities. This plan was set out in a decision and regulates the following issues:

Further securing of the systems in operation (e.g. tank storage, flare, utilities) by way of tests that allow them to continue to operate.
Securing of the process plants that were shut down during the event - Emptying of systems and testing before restart.

Testing on all systems was carried out in accordance with the legal requirements."

More than 2 million m3 of water was released from the tailings-pond. Treated water with less than 4 mg/L dissolved copper content was released into a tributary of the Kalix River. A small amount of inert tailings was also released.,"The suspected cause is that the filter within the dam wall did not have sufficient capacity to drain the pond. Other possible, or contributing, causes are still being investigated.","When the pond collapsed 2.28 million m3 of water was released into the return-water pond downstream. To decrease the pressure on the return-water pond 1.55 million m3 water was released with hardly any environmental effects.Area concerned - Remarks: The volume of water discharged to the Leipojoki River has been calculated as 1.26 M(m3), of which 0.036 M(m3) followed the southern diversion ditch. In addition, 0.3 M(m3) was discharged to the Sakajoki River via the re-circulation water channel. The content of copper in the water as a result of the accident was in the range 19-23 kg, of which 14-17 kg to Leipojoki river and 5-6 kg to Sakijoki river. The excessive flow through the spillways caused erosion along the outer toe of dam I-J.Area concerned - Illustration of effects: The effects of the dam failure are illustrated in the attached report ""Dam failure at the Aitik mine: Investigations, conclusions and measures taken"".Ecological Harm - Remarks:After the accident, consultations were held with Norrbotten county administrative board. It was agreed that extra water sampling was to be carried out at discharge points and sampling stations according to the regular monitoring programme. The samples have been analysed for several metals, suspended solids and turbidity.Material Loss - remarks:Immediately after the dam failure a new dam section was constructed. The construction took about three months.Discussion about Consequences:The investigation noted some sedimentation of solids (tailings, glacial till and natural sediments) as a consequence of the accident.&nbsp; The fraction of tailings in the Vassara River downstream of the confluence with the Leipojoki River was estimated as 3-6 %, based on analyses. The population density of trout and grayling did not differ from the results from previous investigations. For bullhead, the population density was higher than the pre-accident level.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","The Fire and Rescue Service and the County Administrative Board were informed of the accident. The decant tower in the return-water pond was opened and measures were taken to prevent erosion damage at the emergency outlets.Emergency measures - Remarks: Personnel from Norrbotten county admistrative board visited the Aitik mine immediatly after the dam failure.Official action taken - legal action: Norrbotten county administrative board has adjudged that Boliden violated their current permit according to the Environmental Code and the Water Law, which is why the company has been reported to the court on the following four points: (1) Overfilling the clarification pond. (2) Not following conditions stated in the given permits in the Water Law. (3) The characteristics of the dam had been changed without seeking permission for alterations. (4) For having unsanctioned steep embankment sides.","Measures to prevent recurrence: Boliden's manual for operation, supervision and maintenance of dams contains an emergency response plan. It has been verified that the routines in this plan worked well as regards both contacts and measures. One deficiency was noted, the possibility to set off the alarm for high water level in the clarification pond without any immediate follow up investigation. Therefore the routines have been changed so that alarms for both low and high water levels cannot be set off in the control room at the dressing plant, but have to be set off at the recirculation water gate.Useful references: Dam failure at the Aitik mine: Investigations, conclusions and measures taken."
1082,475,Major Accident,Plastic and rubber manufacture,Release of butadiene due to the rupture of a valve on a storage tank in a chemical factory,2000-12-04 18:30:00,2000-12-04 22:30:00,"In a chemical factory, the rupture of a valve on a storage tank caused a butadiene release which emptied the tank.

The amount of released substance exceeded 5% of the upper threshold limit. Therefore, the accident has to be notified according to the criteria of Annex 6.","The brittle failure of the&nbsp; valve in question was caused by spontaneous polymerisation. The valve acted as a by-pass for a remotely controlled valve on the pressure regulation circuit inside the butadiene storage tank. The formation of this polymer, called ""pop"", inside the valve's bonnet&nbsp; was caused by:- The stagnation of butadiene: the valve, which was shut at the time of the accident,created a dead end section, without any circulation of the substance;- The ambient temperature;- The absence of inhibitor (tert-butyl - cathecol): this storage tank does not contain any inhibitor because the butadiene comes from the re-condensation of a gaseous phase, and the inhibitor is eliminated during this process.The increase in volume during the polymerisation caused a considerable rise of the inner pressure, causing the brittle failure of the cast iron valve; the valve's bonnet was torn off.","Nobody was injured in this accident. Some inhabitants of the neighbouring city complained about the smell caused by the release, since butadiene can be smelled above 2 ppm, while the lower explosives limit (LEL) concentration  is 20000 ppm. According to the plant operator, the  explosimeters detection threshold, set at 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL), was not reached.","The internal contingency plan was put in action and the operator set up a&nbsp; central command post on the site. The production units were shut down, water curtains were set up around the storage tank. The external fire brigades arrived around 18:50. Road traffic was stopped South of the site at 19:10 and South East of the site at 19:35. The TGV high speed train line was closed at 20:00.Random explosivity measurements were carried out around the establishment from 19:10 on&nbsp; by the operator, and from 20:00, in a more organised way, by the external fire brigades and by the on site fire brigades.All emergency response measures ended around 22:30.On request by the Classified Installations Inspectorate, a study on the atmospheric dispersion of the butadiene cloud was carried out, in order to determine whether the cloud which dispersed towards the South / South-East could have generated an explosion off-site, and to evaluate whether the population exposed to the cloud's passage may have suffered irreversible health effects.This study highlighted the fact that the explosiveness areas did not cross the property limits. As to the irreversible health effects (IDHL) zone, it seems that it extends a little outside the property limits, however it does not reach any residential buildings outside the site.","In addition to the accident analysis, the Regional Directorate For Industry, Research and Environment (DRIRE -- Direction REgionale de l'Industrie, de la Recherche et de l'Environnement) which is responsible for the inspection of classified installations, has requested the company to present a plan for the prevention of similar accidents.The following measures have been taken:* Inventory of similar configurations for the complete U400 production unit, according to the following criteria:- Presence of dry or wet butadiene without inhibitor- Development of pop favoured by temperature- Development of pop favoured by the presence of a gas phase- Development of pop favoured if the output is low or nil (dead end section, upper taps of tanks in the gas phase, valves and fittings, etc.)- Cast iron valves and fittings* Analysis of the risks of the installations based on the following criteria:- Presence of dry or wet butadiene without inhibitor;- Development of pop favoured by temperature;- Development of pop favoured by the presence of a gas phase;- Development of pop favoured if the output is low or nil (dead end section, upper ttaps of tanks in the gas phase, valves and fittings, etc.);- Cast iron valves and fittings;* Analysis of the risks of the installations based on the following criteria:- Output conveyed;- Nominal diameter;- Line or tank pressure;- Volume involved in case of confinement;- Isolability: is there a means of insulating the critical point, is it accessible in the case of a leak?* Site inventory and analysis: machine checks, verification of the upstream/downstream pressure levels of identified points, manoeuvrability tests of valves and fittings at risk.- Similar configurations have either been removed for verification of the absence of pop, for cleaning where necessary and replacement in certain cases, or a functionality test has been carried out on the valves and fittings, allowing seizing or pop to be detected. In the case of a negative test, the valves/fittings have been removed and cleaned.- The [quarter-turn] valve in question has been replaced by a steel ball valve, pending a detailed study of the problem with the by-pass. Two other cast iron valves have been replaced.- The valve involved in the accident was not classified as critical. At the request of the DRIRE, a ""critical valves/fittings"" inspection plan has been completed on valves and taps which could present a risk of blocking by pop.Besides, the following additional preventive measures have been implemented:.- 2nd level measures realised by the company's inspection service;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .- Half-yearly functionality tests during operation;- Half-yearly dismantling for internal inspection during the 2 annual shutdowns.&nbsp; These last two measures are moved forward 3 months, in order to maximise the coverage of risk-relevant fittings- Replacement of the critical gate valves and of the cast iron fittings by steel fittings during the July 2001 plant shutdown;- Study of each dead end section in order to perform modifications during the July 2001 plant shutdown, in order to reduce ""pop""-related risk. Lesson learned: the uncontrolled and spontaneous butadiene polymerisation phenomenon is a reality which must be considered and its scenario must be analysed, especially in valves used as bypass.This accident has highlighted organisational and safety culture-related problems which are at present under assessment, which should lead to the issue of a complementary decree within the framework of the decree of 10 May 2000 (Seveso II), as lessons learned from:* The lack of action by personnel during the release,&nbsp; to close a manually operated valve placed between the storage tank and the valve involved in the accident, which could have greatly reduced the quantity of substance released into the atmosphere;*The lack of the analysis of this accident scenario in the risk assessment studies leading to an educational and training gap in the personnel and to the assumption of an explosion hazard in proximity of the site ( resulting in the closure of the TGV high speed train line).* The position of the central command post set up by the operators, which could have been reached by the butadiene cloud* The anxiety among certain members of the population, as a reaction to the butadiene smell, caused by a lack of information.* The ill-defined limit between internal and external emergency plan, depending on the drift of the gas under the influence of changing winds* The improvement of crisis management (decisions were made only after excessive delays)* The interfacing instructions with the national railway company SNCF."

1085,33,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Toxic leak in a Titanium Oxide installation caused by wrong maintenace procedure,2000-10-23 10:12:00,2000-10-23 13:25:00,"During the shut-down of the titanium oxide (TiO2) installation an inspection of the level measurement device of the titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) evaporator was carried out. On disconnecting the signal wiring of the level measurement device the proces computer responded to this signal as empty and opened the control valve to fill the evaporator. The evaporator wasn't isolated prior to the start of the work (ineffective work permit system), so the evaporator started to fill with TiCl4, without anyone noticing. Meanwhile the work continued and the level measurement device was removed. The workers observed excess vapors to continue their work and went to the control room to check the vacuum system. At this moment the evaporator overflowed releasing TiCl4 on the second and first level of the reactor building (open floor around the evaporator). TiCl4 produces HCl ant TiO2 on contact with water (including air humidity), so rapidly a thick toxic white cloud formed inside the reactor building. Two contractors that were working on the first floor didn't manage to locate an emergency ladder near their workplace and tried to evacuate to the stairs they used to enter the building. Both were new to the installation and due to the vicinity of the release to the stairs, they were trapped in an unknown installation with almost zero visibility (thick white cloud). Both were found dead by search parties afterwards.
Some of the emergency responders (company and community) were treated for minor chemical burns.","Defective work permit system - the installation was not isolated prior to the work.
Defective information system for contractor workers - victims didn't recieve safety information about the installation ( they didn't use the safe evacuation route).

No interlock system to prevent overflow of evaporator.
The high level alarm was silenced by the panel operator without action.","2 deaths
Several injured, including 2 firefighters

Roads surrounding the facility were closed and neighbouring inhabitants were sheltered in place.
Neighbouring plant was evacuated.","On-site emergency team started the search for the leak and the missing victims.
External firefighting service assisted in fighting the toxic cloud (16 persons).
Several police units blocked roads and alerted neighbouring inhabitants.Legal action: yes, still in progress","Measures to prevent recurrence: Work permit system has to be used strictly, adequate training and supervision necessary.
A difference between no signal and zero signal should be made in the process computer.
Prompt alert of external emergency services is necessary.
Contractors cannot be trusted to inform their personnel about the on-site safety information, a strict control system is necessary.
Many employees evacuate to the control room, which adds to the work load of panel operators.
A management crisis team is necessary to ensure communications with external emergency services.

The cleaned fuel gas is conveyed into the refinery's fuel gas network and the charged diisopropanolamine is regenerated for reuse. The hydrogen sulphide separated during regeneration is transformed into sulphur by the Claus-plants.When the event occurred the low-level shut-down system of the column triggered. Under normal conditions a control valve would have closed and the column level would have risen again. The control valve however was blocked in open position by metal parts (column internals) and the column level dropped to zero. The charged diisopropanolamine was diverted entirely to the regenerator and a gas break-through of H2S occurred over the diisopropanolamine-regenerators towards the Claus-plants.Both the Claus-plants and the downstream catalytic post-combustion unit were overcharged and the gas containing H2S was discharged over the 175m high chimney of the cracker without almost any conversion into sulphur dioxide. The gas-flow rate to the units was regulated to a fixed value and the excess gas was diverted to the H2S-flare In order to prevent the complete breakdown of the Claus-plants.A gas overpressure occurred in the flare system breaking through the hydraulic lock of the earth-tank connected the flare system. The path to the environment was opened, due to the fact that at the same time the sluice system was being prepared for a pressure test and that condensate was being flushed in the tank. This way the flushing medium containing minimal residual amounts of ADIP, fuel gas and H2S were released into the environment.The jammed valve was unblocked and the flare-line shut-off as soon the event dynamics were understood.","A control valve of the absorption column was blocked by metallic parts (column internals) in open position, and the column level dropped to zero.

Shortly after a high gas-yield was detected in the diisopropanolamine regenerator. Almost at the same time an air-compressor of the Claus-plant and a regenerator failed.The gas flow to the Claus-plants was reduced in order to avoid a complete failure of the plants and the remaining flow was diverted to the H2S flare system. Shortly after release of liquid was detected at the diisopropanolamine -sluice system. The staff was informed that this system had been flushed and sealed and that the regularly scheduled system testing was being performed. For this reason initially the spillage of liquid was not related to the occurrence.&nbsp; Due to the fact that the gas flow at he regenerator still was high, the load at the hydrocracker was reduced immediately by switching over to a a low sulphur crude oil. Further to that the load of the separator before the columns was reduced, in order to reduce the gas flow rate.By 10:28 hrs two gas detectors triggered alarm. Further gas alarms were triggered by 10:30 and 10:32. The shift-leader was informed. The fire department informed the onsite fire-brigade about complaints on odour nuisances in the neighbourhood of the plant. Meanwhile it was understood that the leakage of liquid and gas from the sluice system did not depend from the testing procedures but was related to the incident.The installations were immediately evacuated and inspected by staff members equipped with auto respirators. Following to that the fire brigade was requested to create a foam carpet on the pits of the sluice system in order to avoid further odour nuisances.

The explosion caused the failure of the furnace walls and its base, and subsequent fires at the base of the furnace as hydrocarbon continued to be released until the unit was shut down; there were no injuries and the incident appeared to be contained within the unit without any environmental impact. Whilst, there were no actual injuries, access was normally required both on and under the affected furnace, and therefore there was the potential for fatal injuries of one or more operators. Damage to the furnace has been estimated at a cost of £4 million pounds for the furnace demolition phase and £9 million for the furnace construction phase.","Flammable hydrocarbon material (Naphtha) was released into the vacuum column furnace on Crude Distillation Unit when it was shutdown &amp; subsequently ignited leading to an internal explosion within the Furnace. &nbsp;which caused the furnace walls to be pushed out and the floor of the furnace to collapse onto the working space beneath the furnace, which led to subsequent fires at the base of the furnace as hydrocarbon continued to be released until brought under control. Liquid Naphtha had overflowed from the column into the furnace, despite there being an overflow trip valve, because there was a bypass line and manual valve which bypassed the feed line on the column, and it had not been recognised that that this manual valve had to be in the shut position to ensure the column did not continue to fill, even when the high trip was activated. As a result liquid Naphtha was directed into the furnace rather than to the high level vent to atmosphere; the manual valve had also recently been replaced.","Crude Distillation Unit was written off; COMAH major accident reportable to the EU under schedule 7 of COMAH, as the incident led to more than 2 million Euros damage to property within the establishment.
There were no injuries or environmental loss as a result of the incident, however, access under the furnaces was routinely required during start-ups giving rise to the risk of severe or fatal injuries of up to three persons who were working on the unit.",The site has an on-site emergency response capability with its own fire &amp; rescue appliances; these attended the fire almost immediately and crews had extinguished the fire within 15 minutes; the local external emergency responders also attended the scene in support and they departed the site after approximately 2hrs.,"There were -

failings to ensure that when the manual by-pass valve had been replaced that the replacement valve was of the same specification as the valve replaced, or that it had the same failure modes – as a result the liquid Naphtha was able to be directed into the furnace rather than to the high level vent ;&nbsp;
failings to ensure when installing a high level trip and isolation to prevent overfilling column C206, that its management of change procedure (including HAZOP) would be sufficiently robust to identify the column bypass line and manual valve (which could defeat the overfill protection system);
failings to ensure control room operators were provided with suitable information, instruction and training to ensure they could recognise the pre-incident indicators - clear indications that the system was not operating as expected were ignored and the opportunity to investigate the cause was missed.

1092,144,Major Accident,"Waste storage, treatment and disposal",Fire in an intermediate storage facility for special waste,2011-05-22 23:15:00,2011-05-23 16:30:00,"Fire in an intermediate storage facility for special waste.On 22&nbsp;May 2011, at around 23.00, there was a fire in an intermediate storage facility for special waste. A warehouse of around 2&nbsp;600&nbsp;m² consisting of an unprotected steel structure was virtually destroyed, but did not collapse. As regards the spreading of the fire and destruction, it is worth noting that current evidence suggests that the fire started in a covered outdoor storage area, possibly in several places, and then spread to the special storage rooms inside the covered area, in spite of the rooms being separated for fire protection purposes.  The search for the cause of the fire is still ongoing.  Safety measures: - Triggering of the fire alarm system - Triggering of the CO2 extinguishing system - Fire watch",The Land Criminal Police Office assumes that it is a case of arson.,- Damage to buildings - Damage to stackers and shredders,- Fire watch - Surveillance by security firm - Clearing and cleaning of the intermediate storage facility - Controlled fire extinction - Measuring concentration of pollutants,"It should be noted that there were no mandatory standards for fire safety requirements to be met by large roofs at the time the warehouse was planned and built (the standard DIN 18 234-2, for example, was not made mandatory until 1995; guidelines on the construction of industrial buildings did not then contain any specific requirements for roofs).  In future, when planning reconstruction or restoration work, the specific risk situation in the case of fire should be taken into account in addition to the requirements which must in any case be complied with.  The following points should be considered: 1. The basic separation of storage rooms for fire protection purposes must be maintained and the rooms must continue to be fitted with automatic fire alarms and extinguishing systems. 2. Taking into account the potential damage/effects caused by a fire in the storage rooms, the storage rooms should be designed as fire compartments separate from the adjacent outdoor storage areas, even if the hall would be admissible as a fire compartment according to the guidelines on the construction of industrial buildings. The walls separating the storage rooms from the adjacent areas are to be designed as fire walls and must therefore be raised to 0.50&nbsp;m above the roof. 3. Regardless of whether the above recommendation on the formation of fire compartments is followed, the requirements of DIN 18 234 are to be implemented due to the particular risks involved in rebuilding the roof, even if the roof area is less than 2&nbsp;500&nbsp;m². Specific requirements for the construction of roofs only apply to roofs of more than 2&nbsp;500&nbsp;m² according to the guidelines on the construction of industrial buildings. This is important because, even if the storage room area is designed as a separate fire compartment, unless specific measures are taken when designing the roof, a fire in one of the storage rooms could spread to the other storage rooms via the roof. 4. Light domes and/or smoke and heat extraction systems in the storage rooms are to be checked in accordance with the specifications of automatic extinguishing systems. 5. Furthermore, the new warehouse must be planned in accordance with TRGS (Technical Rule for Hazardous Substances) 800 ‘Fire Protection Measures’, adopted in December 2010, the main purpose of which is to protect employees. 6. Although arson cannot always be avoided, checks should be carried out to see whether the covered, freely accessible areas on site can be protected against unauthorised access when the facility is not in operation.  With regard to fire safety requirements, a fire protection expert should be involved in planning the rebuilding of the warehouse."

The area of the neighbouring facility lies currently idle. Therefore, no technical or organisational measures can be formulated for this specific case.A consequence should, however, be that in case of a densely built-up area (here: estimated distance from industrial building to industrial building ca. 6m) the neighbouring facilities should be checked regarding the possibility of causing a domino effect. This also applies to facilities, that do not fall under the provisions of the Seveso Directive. Also here, possible interactions between plants should be examined and appropriate measures taken."
1095,223,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Accidental spill of crude oil followed by a fire and explosion on a beach near a refinery,1998-10-14 22:40:00,1998-10-14 23:45:00,"Accidental spill of crude oil over a rain water drain, followed by a fire and an explosion in the Beach of Aterro near the refinery.For the unloading operations of crude oil through the Ocean Terminal of Leixoes (OTL), operational instructions were issued and distributed on 13/10/1998.The assistant manager of the logistics department and the manager of the Product Handling department worked out a document, dated 14/10/98, with the title ""Procedure for Setting the Pipeline under Pressure with Crude Oil"", concerning the operations of purging the soft water contained in the pipeline connecting the buoy with the refinery of Porto. The contents of the document remained known only to them. The document contained the pumping flow rate (ca. 500 m#/h), the volume of water to be purged (2900m#), the time estimated for purging the pipeline (ca. 6h), the frequency of supervisions of the system (in the first three hours not less than three times an hour; starting from the fourth hour continuous monitoring until conclusion of the purging), the circumstances for which the sewage treatment plant of the refinery would have to be contacted as well as the conditions under which the pumping operations would have to be stopped.On 14/10/98 at about 20:30 h the deputy captain of the ship Enalios Tethis signed a discharge protocol, named ""Operation Agreement &amp; Sequence Agreement"", according to the parameters agreed upon with the Product Handling department, without making any reservation from the part of the tanker concerning the assurance of minimal flow-rate of 500 m#/h .Once the unloading started, the CLT informed the Product Handling control room that according to the information given by the ship, the pumping flow-rate corresponded to 300 m#/h.The assistant manager of the Logistics department requested around 21:05 from- CLT an increase of the flow rate to 500 m#/h. He again requested the control room to confirm jointly with the CLT the flow rate, because the level in the channel was already reaching half level.Around 21:15 the manager of the Product Handling Department communicated to the operator of the waste water treatment plant that the water which was being purged was clean, so that drain 25 (rainwater) could be diverted from the storm-water basin to the sea, an operation which was performed.Around 21:20 the ship informed CLT that pumping was being carried out with a flow rate of 500m#/h , information which was transmitted to the control room of the Product Handling department.Around 21:40 the assistant manager of the Logistics department requested an increase of the pumping flow rate of further 100 m3/h, having observed that in the purging zone (zona di spurgo) the water remained clean and that the level in the channel had increased to near to reach its maximum level; he also requested the CLT to confirm the flow rate. Around 21:45 the deputy captain of the ship informed that the pumping was being carried out at a flow rate of 650 m#/h. After having established that the channel could not contain a higher flow rate, the assistant manager of the logistics department requested not to increase the flow rate any more and, in case of any variation, to reduce it. Instructions were issued to the ship not to exceed a flow rate of 700 m#/h.During shift change at 22:00, the operation coordinator was informed about the situation and it was particularly recommended to him that ""if traces of oil appeared, to request U 7000 (on-site waste water treatment plant) to divert drain 25 to the storm water basins, and after 24:00 to divert the drain to the storm water basin in any case even if no oil spot appeared"".The operator of the waste water treatment plant declared that at 22:30 he saw traces of hydrocarbons in the water flowing in the outlet box of drain 25 towards the rainwater drain; he then went to the storm water basins to ascertain the situation. Around 22:40, he alerted by phone the control room of the Product Handling department and started the operations for diverting drain 25 from the rain water drain to the storm water basin of the waste water treatment plant. Meanwhile, the operator of the Security Service passing near the control room was requested to check what was occurring in drain 25.At 22:45 the release of crude oil by drainage system 25 occurred.In consideration of this situation, it was ordered to divert drain 25 towards the storm water basin and to contact CLT to stop the pumping from the ship.At approx. 22:50 the operator of the waste water treatment plant performed the diverting operation of drain 25 from the rain water drain towards then storm water basins, but due to the high flow rate a part of the effluent was still discharged to the sea. It has not been determined if the operator acted following a specific order from the control room of the Product Handling department or if he acted on his own independent initiative. The operator declared that he acted on his own initiative. The Product Handling department declared on its side that a specific request had been issued.Around 23:05, the Product Handling department requested CLT to interrupt the pumping, which was carried out. The Product Handling department informed CLT that the deputy captain had communicated that until 23:00 2900 m3 had been discharged.Around 23:15 general alarm was released while the fire which had deflagrated on the beach of Aterro propagated through the rain water outfall to the rain water outlet box inside, the refinery .The fire was declared extinguished at 23:45.","- The ship did not respect the pumping program of crude oil, previously agreed between the involved parties to start operations; the permitted flow rate was exceeded by ca. 2.4 times.- The operating procedures drawn up for the Porto refinery were not extensive enough to maintain control of disturbances such as the one that occurred.No risk assessment was performed for setting the pipeline -under pressure (110107)The process for setting the pipeline -under pressure is based on the unloading flow rate of the tanker, a variable which was not controlled by the refinery and was not measured directly and with precision by the tanker.

The local authorities were also alerted in order to activate the off-site emergency plan.Extinguishing foam was introduced in the rain water outfall to fight the fire at the beach of Aterro and, after the fire was extinguished, the feeding of foam was maintained in order to assure a complete covering with this extinguishing agent, so as to avoid the release of flammable vapours, which could re-ignite.During the extinguishing operations, approximately 50000 l of foaming agent were used to produce the extinguishing foam.The fire was declared extinguished at 23:45 h.Environmental damage caused by the spill of crude oil was not very serious, because of the amount spilled and the immediate start of operations to reduce the consequences and for restoration.Emergency measures - Remarks: The means involved in the fire fighting operations were the following :-- Human means- 6 members of the security service- 7 members of the emergency response team of the fire brigade- 5 members of the auxiliary group of the fire brigade-- Equipment- 4 fire fighting vehicles- 1 supply vehicle- 1 ambulance- 3 diesel engine generators (U-4501 A ,B, and C)- 1 electric pump (P-4508)- 48500 litres of extinguishing foam extract A3 SPThe chronology of the response operations was as follows:Around 23:05 on 14/10/1998, the Security Service operator appointed to the aromatic compound plant, contacted the shift manager of the Security Service informing him that crude oil was reaching U7000 through the rain water drain. The control room of the Product Handling department was immediately contacted. While the shift manager of the Security Service was going to inspect U7000, the Security Service operator who was already there, he informed the control room over radio that he saw a glimmer on the beach towards U7000.At 23:15, the general alarm of the refinery was released after confirmation of the occurrence by the shift manager of the Security Service.It was ordered to start the production of extinguishing foam with a fire fighting vehicle and to inject the foam in the rain water outfall through the corresponding&nbsp; outlet box .Meanwhile the shift manger of the Security Service instructed the Communication Centre of the Security Service to inform the fire brigade of Matasinhos-Leca as well as to activate the off-site emergency plan.The Security Service team and the members of the emergency response service (of the fire brigade) collaborated in the fire fighting operations, by introducing extinguishing foam into the rain water outfall and by taking preventive measures such as covering with foam the area surrounding the&nbsp; outlet box of that rain water outfall as well as the basins of U 7000 and also by creating water curtains. In order to protect the control room of U 7000 and assure a perfect coverage (protection) of the area of the beach and the sea affected by the spillage, the foam was introduced for a long time in the rain water outfall.At 23:45 the fire was declared extinguished and the situation was completely under control.Due to the continuation of the foam injection, the end of the emergency was formally declared at 01:45 of 15/10/1998.The seriously injured person was evacuated by the National Institute for Medical Emergencies to the Pedro Hispano Hospital and successively to the Unit for severe burns of the Coimbra University Hospital.The body of the deceased person was removed after the legal formalities had been performed in presence of a representative of the state attorney's office and a representative of the municipal health authority; an autopsy was successively carried out on the body at the Institute for Legal Medicine of Porto.The Northern Marine Department was in charge of assessing and controlling the pollution; operations started at 07:00 on 15/10/1998 with the identification of the spots and terminated at 12:00 of the same day by using the following boats: Barra de Leixoes, Barra de Viana, Leao dos Mares. Only one small spot, having an extension of 100 m, was observed near the shore; the spot was thin and not very large and looked like diesel oil. No other spots were detected between the estuary of the Douro river and the area in front of Cabo Mundo.Official action taken - legal action: Judicial investigation carried out by the state attorneyOfficial action taken - other official action: The General Direction of Energy withdrew the operation license of TOL (oil terminal)The Ministry of Economy created an investigation commission to define&nbsp; exhaustively the responsibilities related to the accident. The final recommendations of the related report were the following:Immediate actionsa) complete demolishing of the provisional drainage system up to 10"" gate valve connected to the 40"" diameter new pipeline.b) Setting up and approval of detailed operational procedures, including the procedures for discharging clean or emulsified water, and foreseeing future situations in which a new hydrostatic test may be requested.c) Development of more effective routines for verifying the technical capability of the tanker to control the pumping flow rates at any given time during discharge operations, if requested by the situation. d) Definition of adequate routines for the documentation of the entire process of working out and authorising operational procedures or working instructions, respective discussion and familiarisation of the workers directly involved (documenting the operation), particularly for exceptional tasks.e) Revoke the withdrawal of the operation license of the TOL (oil terminal), ordered in resolution No. 9/98 of Director General of Energy dated 15/10/1998, considering the necessity to operate TOL (the oil terminal) for supplying the refinery with raw materials; the analysis of the accident causes and all other elements collected during the investigation have clearly established that the operation of TOL (oil terminal) in normal condition does not represent any major risk (the successful unloading of the crude oil after the accident confirms it).Medium term actions:a) Planning of integrated measures for risk assessment inspections, carried out&nbsp; by independent and competent authorities with the goal of assessing the integrity of the existing transfer installation for the crude oil unloaded for the refinery and the respective storage systems, and more specifically with regard to the respective state of corrosion.b) Conclusion of the revision process of procedure DGRP 090.06/19994 - issue and approval&nbsp; of study requests and execution of studies concerning specifically the adoption of appropriate methodologies for the evaluation of operational risks.c) Realisation of an external safety audit of the procedures and processes of the Petrogal Refinery of Porto and publishing of the results.d) Study and revision of the&nbsp; framework for the initial and subsequent licensing procedures for similar installations, considering both the safety aspect and&nbsp; the legal aspect, which normally foresees the appointment of a legal party responsible for collecting all advice involved and the initial definition of all parties to be consulted.&nbsp;- Follow up and verification of the implementation of the actionsThe Investigation Commission proposed the setting up of a follow-up commission,&nbsp; with the participation of the Municipal&nbsp; Chamber of Montesinhos, with the goal of monitoring the implementation of the recommended actions, and in particular of guaranteeing the population the safety conditions which legitimately can be expected from an industrial installation of this type.Concerning the methodology to be adopted for the implementation, it was proposed to work out a report documenting the implementation of the recommended measures, directly under the responsibility of the Refinery Manager.This report will have to document all the measures taken to eliminate the risk of the occurrence of similar accidents and discuss the degree of effectiveness of such measures and the possibility of maintaining them over time.The report will have to contain at least:- A review of the main and secondary hazard sources- A review of all key factors or critical points identified, all preventive measures&nbsp; taken, the degree of effectiveness of such measures and the possibility of maintaining them over time..- A matrix listing the original recommendations, responsibilities for the implementation, and measures taken to comply with each recommendation.

1096,44,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Explosion and fire in a distillation unit due to unexpected accumulation of methyl hydroperoxide (MHP),2006-04-09 14:00:00,2006-04-09 15:30:00,"SUMMARYAt approximately 14.00 on Sunday 9th April there was an explosion followed by a fire at the Distillation Unit 1. The specific distillation column K23 was shut down at the time of the incident for scheduled maintenance when a heat exchanger exploded and the cumene ignited. The automatic systems for foaming were activated and the on-site emergency services were quickly on the scene. They were joined by the external emergency services. The fire was extinguished at 15.23. &nbsp;Two firemen were taken to hospital having come into contact with cumene, a mild irritant. They were released following check-up and have suffered no long-term effects. There was no environmental issue outside of the plant area and there was no risk to the local community. It was found that there was an unexpected accumulation of methyl hydroperoxide (MHP) in the upper part of column K23 during normal operation. During the shut down of the column, the MHP was enriched in the aqueous side draw. Because of specific circumstances parts of this water could flow into the hot heat exchanger, where a thermal explosion of the MHP containing liquid led to an over pressurization of the apparatus. The explosion tore off the feed and outlet pipes. Cumene mainly leaked from the long pipe towards a buffer tank and ignited. &nbsp;Cumene is a colorless, flammable liquid.INCIDENT DESCRIPTIONOn Sunday April 9th K23 was being shutdown in order to perform a regulatory inspection of the column reboiler.&nbsp; The shutdown of K23 was being conducted as outlined in the procedure. The first focus in shutting down K23 was stopping the feed and evacuating the bottom of the column. At 13.17, the feed to K23 from the Cumene Extraction Unit was stopped by closing a manual valve at the Cumene Extraction Unit.&nbsp; At approximately the same time, the level controller for the sump of K23 was placed in manual operation with a fixed valve position to allow K23 to be pumped empty to Tank 93. The level of K23's sump immediately began to decrease, reaching 10% by 13.19.&nbsp; The level remained stable at 10%, although material was continually pumped from K23.&nbsp; This is an indication that the level transmitter was not reporting correctly and that the actual level was below the lower nozzle of the level instrument.&nbsp; Based on calculations, it is estimated that approximately 1 m3 of material remained in K23 below the lower nozzle of its level instrument.&nbsp; At 13.25, K23's bottom pump began to cavitate, indicating that the column was nearly empty, and was shut down at 13.28.&nbsp; The bottoms product from K23 is cooled by the feed in a preheater (WBG2336).&nbsp; Having already shut off the feed to K23, there was no cooling of the bottoms product as indicated by a temperature rise on the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93. This temperature indicator reached a maximum temperature of 128 °C at 13.24, which is the same time that K23 was empty.The second focus in shutting down K23 was preventing low boiling components from entering the bottom of the column. To ensure that the low boiling components remained in the overheads of the column, the steam flow controller was placed in manual operation at 13.19 and steam input was reduced over a three-minute period.&nbsp; At 13.25 the steam condensate temperature increased indicating that heat transfer was no longer taking place due to K23's sump being empty.&nbsp; At 13.29, the steam flow was stopped by placing the controller at 0% output.&nbsp; The interface level in BBG2305 began increasing at 13.25, indicating the accumulation of additional water in this vessel.&nbsp; This level increase was a combined result of shutting off the steam flow to K23 and continuing to reflux material from BBG2303 to the top of K23.&nbsp; At 13.39, the reflux flow controller was placed in manual operation at 0% output.&nbsp; At 13.54, BBG2305's level controller was placed in manual control at a fixed valve position of 10%.&nbsp; The outlet flow from BBG2305 was estimated to be 25 liter/min and resulted in a continuous decrease of the aqueous level in BBG2305.&nbsp; At 13.58, the aqueous level in BBG2305 went to 0%, indicating that organic material was then being pumped from BBG2305 to Tank 93.At approximately 14.00 an explosion occurred at WBG2336, which resulted in a fire in the South West corner of Distillation Unit 1. The sprinkler and foam systems for Distillation Unit 1 were immediately activated. The site emergency response team quickly responded to the incident and was later joined by outside emergency services. The fire could not be extinguished until 15.23 due to being unable to successfully isolate fuel sources from the fire.","FAILURE ANALYSISThe explosion occurred at WBG2336, which is a spiral heat exchanger that is used to heat up the feed to K23 by cooling down the bottom product.&nbsp; During normal operation the feed is heated and the bottoms product is cooled from 145 °C.&nbsp; The feed to K23 enters WBG2336 at the side and exits at the top (cold side of the heat exchanger). The bottom product from K23 enters WBG2336 at the bottom and exits at the side (hot side of the heat exchanger).&nbsp; During the modified operation the aqueous side draw from BBG2305 was added to the exit of this stream. Based on the inspection of WBG2336, it was determined that the failure resulted from the over pressurization in the hot side of the heat exchanger. The spiral failed at a pressure between 10 and 15 barg. Such a pressure could be reached by for example a gas explosion. Four scenarios were identified during the incident investigation as possible causes of the over pressurization. The scenarios are as follows:""&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thermal Expansion occurring during a blocked in condition""&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CHP spontaneously decomposing within the exchanger""&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MHP slowly decomposing to form hydrogen and oxygen thereby creating an atmosphere which at only low activation energy could lead to an explosion ""&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MHP spontaneously decomposing within the exchanger.Thermal ExpansionDuring the shut down of the column there were several manual valves closed in order to isolate K23 from other processes. Therefore, the possibility for a blocked in condition of WBG2336 needed to be evaluated. The feed to WBG2336 was stopped by closing a manual valve (V1) in the Cumene Extraction Unit. After K23 had been emptied and the bottom pump was stopped, the manual valve (V2) at the discharge of the pump was closed. This isolated WBG2336 from the bottom of K23, but allowed for an opening at the outlet from WBG2336 to Tank 93.&nbsp; At this same time, the manual valve (V3) at the outlet of WBG2336 to K23 was also shut. Shortly after that, approximately 9 minutes, the operator realized that he had closed the wrong valve. At this point the operator opened the manual valve (V3) at the outlet of WBG2336 to K23 and closed the manual valve (V4) at the cold side inlet to WBG2336.&nbsp; A spike in the flow meter (FR82331) on the feed line to K23 provides an indication of this valve manipulation. Based on the short period of time of the blocked in condition and short duration of the associated flow spike, the pressure buildup was determined to be insufficient to cause damage to WBG2336. It was also determined that the severity of the damage to WBG2336 could not have been caused by thermal expansion.&nbsp; Therefore, this scenario was eliminated as a possible cause for the over pressurization of WBG2336.Spontaneous Decomposition of CHPDuring normal operation of K23, there is approximately 2% CHP in the feed to and bottom product from the column. Due to the highly reactive nature of CHP, the possibility of spontaneous decomposition needed to be evaluated. An analysis of the material from the bottom of K23 at 10.00 on April 9th showed that the CHP content was 1.43%, which was in line with expected values. An analysis of a sample from the feed line to WBG2336 following the incident indicated that the CHP content was 0.92%, which was slightly below the expected value.&nbsp; Based on testing it is known that even at a temperature of 140 °C, no instantaneous decomposition of 2% CHP would occur. In a weak acid system, pH &gt; 2, CHP would decompose mainly to DMPC and ACP through thermal decomposition. It would also decompose partially to phenol and acetone through acid catalyzed decomposition. Based on this information the spontaneous decomposition of CHP was eliminated as a possible scenario for the over pressurization of WBG2336.MHP Decomposition to Hydrogen and OxygenDuring normal operation, there was approximately 0.2% MHP in the feed, 0.1% in the bottom product, and below 3% in the aqueous phase of K23's side draw.&nbsp; A partial decomposition of MHP to methanol and hydrogen was expected in K23 based on operating experience.&nbsp; However, samples taken from the side draw receiver (BBG2305) and the overhead receiver (BBG2303) following the incident showed increased levels of MHP in both vessels.&nbsp; After the incident the MHP concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 were determined to be 28 and 8 % respectively. The pH figures of both liquids were below 3. Although it was known that the feed to column K23 contained only small amounts of MHP, it was not known that MHP could be concentrated in localized areas. A literature review on this topic identified only one case where increased MHP concentrations were linked to an explosion in a process for making surfactants. Due to the lack of physical properties for MHP, this condition is difficult to model. However, after making certain assumptions, a simulation for the operation of K23 could be performed. The simulation indicated that MHP could be concentrated in the upper section of the column in the aqueous phase and remain there during normal operation with a peak of around 7%.&nbsp; Obviously, as shown by the analysis of material in BBG2305 after the incident, the MHP was concentrated up to a much higher concentration. This was probably caused during specific shut down conditions at relatively high reflux ratios. The identified location of the MHP peak was between the top tray, where reflux is added to the column, and just above the side draw. Thus, the temperature profile and outlet configuration could allow for K23 to reach equilibrium with an area of localized high concentration of MHP in the top section and low concentrations in all of the outlet streams. K23 is designed so that all liquid contained above the side draw is directed to BBG2305. Therefore, when K23 is shut down and its contents are allowed to flow into the bottom, the concentrated MHP would flow into BBG2305 where it would be separated with the aqueous phase and be pumped to Tank 93. This condition is supported by the sample analysis from material in BBG2305 following the incident, which indicated MHP concentrations that were much higher than expected during normal operation. In addition to MHP the simulation showed a much lower peak for hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which was in the feed to the column, too. With a concentration of 20 wppm in the feed the estimated peak was 100 wppm besides the 7 % MHP. The H2O2 concentration in BBG2305 after the incident was determined to be 385 wppm besides 28 % MHP. As well as for MHP the calculated maximal concentration for H2O2 is lower than the analyzed figure, due to a probably higher accumulation during the shut down procedure. Normally, the cumene at the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93 is at a temperature of 35 °C.&nbsp; However, after the feed to K23 was stopped, the temperature of WBG2336 increased to at least 128 °C. This is indicated on the temperature indicator at the outlet of WBG2336 to Tank 93. A review of the piping configuration indicated that in addition to being exposed to the hot cumene exiting WBG2336, the aqueous phase, due to a difference in density, could also migrate into the hot side of the heat exchanger. The bottom section of WBG2336's hot side could be filled with aqueous material by displacement of the hot cumene. This displacement is indicated by a temperature increase from 109 °C to 134 °C on temperature indicator TR82374. Similarly, the top section of WBG2336's hot side could accumulate a vapor phase that could be generated through the decomposition of MHP. Since the hot side of WBG2336 was not equipped with a vent line, this vapor phase would accumulate down to the side outlet of the heat exchanger from where it would then begin to flow into the transfer line to Tank 93.&nbsp; Based on mechanical drawings, it is estimated that the maximum volume of vapor that would accumulate in WBG2336 would be 175 liters.&nbsp; Following a discussion with specialists in the field of explosion testing, it is now known that vapor phases containing hydrogen concentrations in the range of 16% to 90%, with the remainder being composed of oxygen, could be ignited with minimal energy input and a detonation would occur.&nbsp; Under these conditions, even small explosive gas volumes could result in excessive localized pressure upon ignition. Due to the elevated level of MHP in the system, the formation of an explosive atmosphere with hydrogen and oxygen, resulting from the decomposition of MHP, needed to be evaluated, as the review of the system indicated no path for oxygen to enter the system from the atmosphere. The Limiting Oxygen Concentration (LOC) for hydrogen is 4.3 Vol% at normal conditions. Taking into account the higher temperature in the heat exchanger, the LOC was around 3.8 Vol%. A hydrogen containing gas atmosphere with more than 4 Vol % of hydrogen is only explosive if at the same time the oxygen concentration is above the LOC.Based on a few former investigations, it was known that MHP decomposes to hydrogen. The reaction is relatively fast at a high pH and low at a pH below 7. The reaction is enhanced by adding formaldehyde to the MHP containing solution, but again only hydrogen is formed. Oxygen could only be formed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which is present in the aqueous stream (2) from BBD0020. The concentration of&nbsp; H2O2 in the cumene stream (1), which was the feed to K23, was analyzed to be below 20 wppm. The H2O2 concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 were determined to be 385 and 50 wppm respectively, besides the much higher MHP concentrations of 28 % and 8 % respectively. Based on this a simultaneous formation of significant amounts of oxygen from H2O2 besides hydrogen formation from MHP was very unlikely. To verify the mechanism of hydrogen formation from MHP and to exclude a simultaneous formation of critical amounts of oxygen at low pH, several decomposition tests were made. The tests were made with the MHP and H2O2 containing stream (2), as well as with the liquid from BBG2305, taken after the incident. The tests were made in a special adiabatic calorimeter (Vent Sizing Package calorimeter VSP). Around 65 ml were filled in a 110 ml vessel, which was then closed and set under a slight vacuum. The vessel was heated until the thermal decomposition occurred and the content heated up itself under adiabatic conditions. The vessel was cooled down to around ambient temperature and a gas sample was taken. The analyzed gas concentrations were corrected to take into account preliminary air content from slight vacuum. At each test a double gas analysis was made. No peroxides could be analyzed from the remaining liquid, thus there was always a total decomposition. In addition to the gas analysis, such calorimetric tests deliver information about reaction heat and reaction dynamics, see chapter 4.4. In case of a very violent reaction (runaway) the VSP vessel bursts and the content is released to a secondary compartment, which is filled with nitrogen. Ten tests (run 1 to 10) were made.Runs 1 to 6 were made with the MHP and H2O2 containing stream (2) from the process, at different pH. In general, mainly hydrogen is formed in an amount of 25 to 35&nbsp; mol% of the initial amount of MHP. That fits very well to the operational experience of Thermi I. The amount of oxygen varies with the pH. At a low pH, only 20 mol% in maximum of the H2O2 are converted to oxygen. That is not surprising, because in the presence of MHP, formaldehyde is formed which reacts with H2O2 to form hydrogen, too. In contrast, the formation of oxygen from H2O2 is around 100 % at a pH of 7. At a higher pH the formation of oxygen from H2O2 is again reduced. From these test runs a reaction heat of around 340 kJ per mol MHP could be determined. The activation energy of the decomposition reaction is around 120 kJ/mol. These figures indicate that the decomposition reaction is highly exothermic and increases rapidly with increasing temperature. The gas formation is around 12.4 ln (standard norm liter) per mol MHP. Runs 7 to 10 were made with the MHP containing stream from BBG2305. As already mentioned above, only small amounts of H2O2 (385 wppm) were in this stream. Run 7 was made with a diluted sample to be able to get gas samples. Unfortunately the gas analysis failed, but from the exothermic reaction a similar reaction heat was found, as in the tests before. Run 8 was made with a higher concentrated MHP solution of 15.8 %. The reaction behaviour of a solution with such a higher MHP concentration is also described in a Japanese paper. As expected, the calorimeter burst and the content was released into the secondary compartment. A gas sample could not be taken. The results from this test about reaction dynamics of such a higher concentrated MHP solution will be discussed in chapter 4.4. Runs 9 and 10 were made again with a lower concentrated solution to get reliable gas concentrations from the decomposition. Again it could be shown that mainly hydrogen is formed besides small and uncritical amounts of oxygen.For all tests an analyzed concentration of lower than 0.5 Vol% oxygen should be considered as an inaccuracy of taking and analyzing the gas samples. Significant higher concentrations could only be found from decomposition of solutions with significant amounts of H2O2, see runs 1 to 6. As only small amounts of H2O2 were present in the side stream from K23 besides a high concentration of MHP, the decomposition could only lead to low concentrations of oxygen, see runs 9 to 10. The decomposition of such a solution could not lead to an explosive gas atmosphere. The oxygen concentration would have been always below the Limiting Oxygen Concentration of 3.8 Vol%. Based on these results, the formation of an explosive gas atmosphere and a successive ignition was eliminated as a possible scenario for the over pressurisation of WBG2336. Nevertheless it will be recommended to develop guidelines for proper handling of liquids containing MHP and/or H2O2 to prevent any accumulation of flammable atmosphere.Spontaneous Decomposition of MHPAs stated in the previous section, normal MHP concentrations are relatively low throughout the system and a partial decomposition of MHP to methanol and hydrogen was expected in K23 based on operating experience. Samples taken from the system, following the incident indicated MHP concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 as 28 and 8 % respectively.&nbsp; Due to the elevated level of MHP in the system, the spontaneous decomposition of MHP, leading to a thermal explosion, needed to be evaluated.&nbsp; A thermal explosion of a reactive liquid, what is also called a runaway reaction, leads to a temperature and pressure increase due to the heat and gas formation, all effects increasing exponentially with increasing temperature. As already described in the previous section, the MHP concentration in the column could be concentrated in the upper section of the column in the aqueous phase and remain there during normal operations. Therefore, when K23 was shut down, the concentrated MHP could flow into BBG2305 where it was separated with the aqueous phase and pumped to Tank 93. As described in the previous section, this aqueous material could migrate to WBG2336 and filled the bottom section of the exchanger's hot side after stopping the pump PBG2300. Based on the temperature indication at the outlet of the hot side, it is known that this area was at a temperature of at least 128 °C.&nbsp; At this temperature, it was known that MHP will thermally decompose.&nbsp; However, both the decomposition velocity, nor the amount of energy that would be generated by this elevated concentration of MHP, were not known yet. The test run 8, was made with a solution of 15.8 % MHP and took place under adiabatic conditions. The test showed a continuous increase of temperature up to 180°C and an increase of pressure because of gas formation. At this temperature, the pressure was around 20 bar and the vessel burst. From this test the kinetics of the MHP decomposition could be evaluated, which allows to calculate the temperature and pressure increase over time for adiabatic conditions and various conditions regarding MHP concentration and starting temperature. Based on the reaction heat of 340 kJ/mol, an aqueous solution would heat up with around 17°C per one percent decomposed MHP under adiabatic conditions. The Japanese paper, presents some results from decomposition tests of MHP solutions up to 16.3 %. A reaction heat of 341 kJ/mol MHP was found, what is very similar to the results from the own investigations. For the 16.3 % MHP solution a maximal heat rate of around 20°C per second is reported in the Japanese paper, what was the maximal detection rate in that test apparatus. From the experiment at Degussa with a 15.8% MHP solution a heat rate of 30°C per second was detected, just before the vessel burst at 180°C. Thus, for the same MHP concentration the decomposition rate of the side draw from K23 was similar or even higher than reported in the Japanese paper. &nbsp;It is now very likely, that the following scenario happened: At around 13.28, when K23's bottom pump was stopped, the aqueous phase could flow into WBG2336 by displacing hot cumene. The aqueous phase from K23's side draw vessel BBG2305 had a temperature of around 70°C. Hot cumene was displaced and flowed to Tank 93, As already mentioned, this was indicated by the temperature increase from 109 °C to 134 °C by the indicator TR82374. After reaching this maximum at 13.39, the temperature dropped down to finally 106 °C at 14.00. In maximum, the lower part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger could be filled up with the aqueous phase, what was around 155 liters. By initial gas formation from MHP decomposition, hydrogen could accumulate in the upper part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger. The aqueous phase could heat up in contact with the hot cumene and the hot steel from the heat exchanger, as well as by MHP decomposition, until it started to boil. The pressure in the heat exchanger was around 0.7 barg, coming from the backpressure of Tank 93. The boiling point of pure water at this pressure is 115°C. But as the aqueous phase contained light boilers like MHP, acetone and methanol, the boiling point was lower, probably around 106°C, which was finally indicated by TR82374. First the vapor could accumulate, besides hydrogen, in the upper part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger and then had to release to the line towards Tank 93. The initial MHP concentration in the aqueous phase from BBG2305 was probably below 3 %, as it was from normal operation of K23. After the incident the MHP concentration in BBG2305 was 28 %. It is assumed, that the mean concentration in the heat exchanger was finally 15 %, what is approximately the average of these two figures. By evaporating, the heat from MHP decomposition could initially be discharged, until the thermal explosion occurred. Due to heat removal by evaporation at the beginning, the effective MHP concentration, which finally caused a thermal explosion, was lower. Nevertheless, the gas formation from 6 % MHP is already sufficient to exceed a pressure of 15 barg, what caused the failure of the heat exchanger. Form the kinetics a runaway of a 15 % MHP solution occurs within 100 seconds, starting at 106°C. At a temperature of more than 115°C, the pressure increase over time from gas formation is higher than 10 bars per second. Such a high pressure gradient could not be compensated by a release of the gas towards Tank 93, because the inertia of the liquid in the long pipe was too high.&nbsp; Consequently the heat exchanger burst, as it could not withstand a pressure of more than 15 barg. Based on these investigations, a thermal explosion (runaway) of a higher concentrated MHP solution is the cause for the over pressurisation of the spiral heat exchanger WBG2336.",Material LossAffected Area: Affected Area: installationAffected Area: Affected Area: establishment,"EMERGENCY RESPONSE CRITIQUE
During the incident the overall response by the internal intervention
team was adequate. Sprinklers were activated instantaneously. The foam
system was activated 2 minutes after the event and after blocking the
sprinkler system. The pool fire was fed on a continuous basis by back
flow of cumene. The external fire brigade was warned at 14.02.
Arrival external fire brigade at 14.24. 
The intervention team and the external fire brigade managed to separate an area of 10 by 10m by installing a water curtain. 
The overflow of the bund created a supplementary problem. The fire was
spread over a larger area which enabled more damage to electrical cable
trenches.&nbsp; Additionally minor soil contamination was introduced by the
overflow. 
The overflow was&nbsp; a direct consequence of&nbsp; a loss of the power supply
of sump pumps and the absence of an additional emergency overflow
The duration of the event was prolonged by the lack of effective means
to stop the back flow of cumene on short notice. At 15.20 the back flow
was stopped, leading to total control of the situation at 15.25.
During the whole event foam and water supply proved to be sufficient at al times.
The emergency response team acted conform internal procedure, except
for the external communications to neighbouring companies and one local
authority, that had only been informed indirectly.
The first official information in writing was provided rather late (2hr after start event).
At a later stage (approx 18.00) the competent authorities were de-briefed and informed adequately.&nbsp; ",Operational Avoid the fractional distillation of any liquid containing MHP as an intermediate boiling liquid.Develop guidelines for proper venting on systems containing MHP with/without H2O2 to prevent the accumulation of flammable atmosphere.Based on the results of laboratory experiments perform new PHA (Process Hazard Analysis) for units containing MHP with/without H2O2.Emergency ResponseEvaluate the need for critical valves at the battery limits with a specific focus on isolating large volumes of flammable material from incident areas.Ensure better drainage of process containment area to prevent overflow of flammable material that expands the incident area and might result in environmental damage. Consider dividing larger process containment areas into smaller sections to minimize the spread of flammable materials throughout large process areas.Consider a short version of the emergency procedure in order to support the individual responsible for external communication to focus on all obliged information to local authorities. Consider alternative routing of instrument and power cables for critical equipment in new designed areas to prevent them from being exposed to a fire within a process unit.Modify existing response plans to include detailed information regarding the actions to be taken during an incident within specific units.

The released liquid, having got in contact with the water in the ground, has caused a primary exothermal reaction forming a hydrochloric acid cloud and secondary reactions forming flammable products and the consequent ignition of such products. The response action for extinguishing the fire with water and foam has caused the formation of hydrochloric acid in significant quantities and the further increase of the hydrochloric acid cloud which moved towards the municipality of Sermoneta, but did not reach it because it dissolved approx. 2 km distance from the installation.The accident occurred at 15:30 of 16 September 1998. The emergency response teams of the establishment extinguished the fires and stopped the leakage of trichloride from the tank in 4 minutes. The HCl cloud which had formed was completely dissolved after an hour. The interruption on the adjacent railway line, which was realised immediately lasted for 40 minutes.

1101,951,Major Accident,Processing of metals using electrolytic or chemical processes,Hydrogen explosion in hydrochloric acid tank,2014-01-23 09:54:00,2014-01-23 10:00:00,"Two workers were asked to change the piping and support of a feed line into an intermediate storage vessel for hydrochloric acid. The line was opened, and as they started grinding on the line support, an explosion occurred. The flame propagated back into the tank, causing a second explosion inside. The tank ripped open and was catapulted into the air, killing both victims in the process. The explosion was caused by the unexpected presence of a considerable amount of hydrogen in the tank. The hydrogen was formed in a reaction of traces of metal powder and the hydrochloric acid, and must have accumulated over a period of two months. The traces of metal powder were present in the acid feed to the storage tank. This was the result of an incomplete reduction reaction in an upstream reactor. In that reactor, the metal powder was used to remove traces of metaloxides from the acid. Since 2009, the reactor was being operated at a lower temperature than the process was designed for, resulting in a lower reaction rate. Due to the lower reaction rate, traces of unreacted metal powder were present in the feed sent from the reactor to the intermediate storage vessel. In the storage vessel, the reaction continued, producing small amounts of hydrogen, which accumulated in the top. When the piping on top was opened, some hydrogen escaped and was ignited by the sparks of the grinding. The reactor has a ventilation system, designed to remove the hydrogen generated in the reduction reaction. The storage vessel did not. The possibility of hydrogen formation or presence in the intermediate storage vessel was never identified during risk assessment studies of the installation. The influence of the operating temperature on the reaction process was never documented, and no safe operating window for the reactor temperature was determined. Even though Management of Change procedures were in place, no risk assessment was made for the change in operating temperature of the reactor in 2009. A work permit was granted for the execution of the piping modification. Since no flammable vapours were expected, no explosion prevention measures were taken.
","The operating temperature of the reactor was lowered in 2009, but the impact of this change on the process was never analysed. Management of change procedures were in place, but not followed.
A risk analysis and assessment was made of this installation, using the HAZOP methodology, but the possibility of hydrogen formation in the storage vessel was never identified. The risk assessment team did not focus sufficiently on the chemical process aspects of the installation.
The safe operating window for the process parameters in the reactor was not determined.",Two workers were killed by the explosion.,Both victims died instantly and there was no fire.The direct emergency response was limited to neutralising the hydrochloric acid.,"Risk assessment must be thorough, assessment methodologies (such as HAZOP) must be followed in detail. Risk assessment should be conducted by a multidisciplinary team who have a thorough knowledge of both chemical process and mechanical installation. Management of Change procedures must also be applied to process changes, such as changes in operating temperature. The safe operating window of process parameters (pressure, temperature, flow rate...) must be determined and documented."

During the startup there was an immediate rise of pressure, resulting in increased tension of container walls, resulting to the rupture of the weld.The sharp increase of pressure in the container,containing tar oil at 135 degrees Celsius, was caused by pumping a certain amount of water that has been condensed in the pipe line. During maintenance, pipeline is cleaning by blowing  of steam.

Reportable as the incident involved the accidental loss of more than 5% of the qualifying amount laid down in the COMAH regulations.At approximately 15.30 hours on Wednesday 21 July 1999, a maintenance supervisor noticed wetness around the berm of tank 713. It was concluded that sodium cyanide was leaking from tank 713. At 16.50, following checks for suitability and cleanliness, the transfer of the tank contents to tank 402 commenced. A pump was also set up to collect product pooling in the bunded area. The atmosphere surrounding the tank was checked for cyanide vapour. None was detectable at any height above 5cm from the wet bunded area floor.Meteorolgical conditions at the time of the incident were not significant, except in so much as the leak was detected initially by a visual sighting by an operator of the leak against an otherwise dry tank berm. It may be conjectured that it would have been significantly more difficult to observe this leak had the berm already been wet from precipitation.","&nbsp;It seems likely that the cause of the leak was a weld slag inclusion from the original fabrication of the tank in 1977. The weld slag inclusion is at the stop start of the run of the weld. It is believed that water penetrated between the inclusion and the parent weld during water jetting operations. This then produced rust and in turn pressure capable of dislodging the inclusion and forming the leak path.

No adverse effects on river life were noted. A pump was set up to recover material pooling within the bunded area to a waiting road tanker. This recovered 4.260 tonnes of solution, reducing the quantity lost to the river to 12.301 tonnes.Official action taken - other official action: A COMAH prohibition notice was issued by the competent authority, prohibiting use of the tank until repair was made to the satisfaction of the competent authority.","Measures to prevent recurrence: A COMAH prohibition notice was issued by the competent authority, prohibiting use of the tank until repair was made to the satisfaction of the competent authority.

The slide valves are designed to retain extinguishing water and not to retain&nbsp; leaked products in accordance to the requirements of the fire department. In any case the sliding valves could not have retained the leakage of the rinsing liquid containing chrome trioxide into the sewage system, due to the fact that until now failures of the plant could only be detected through the regular inspections rounds, because there was no direct emergency communication system between the plant with the SPS control system of the continuously manned central galvanisation line.

For safety reasons, water was sprayed onto the roof of the building to precipitate escaping vapours.As the safety valve of the affected reactor (on the roof) had tripped, any release of hydrogen cyanide via the roof had to be controlled. This made it possible to prevent a hazard for the surrounding area.
The site fire brigade then triggered a broader alarm and raised the alert state from level 1 to level 3. As a result, the operator’s staff organisation and the municipal fire service of Grenzach-Wyhlen were alerted.The fire detector was triggered by the release of reaction mass from a container. In the production area, high concentrations of hydrogen cyanide in the ambient air were detected in the immediate vicinity of the release (beyond the measuring range of the portable 100 ppm detectors).In other parts of the building (other floors and the measuring station), the measurements remained in the lower range from 1 to 3 ppm.
At 07:54, the situation in the production area was under control. The containers concerned were not pressurised and the escaped reaction mass was distributed in the production area.At 08:00, a D2 message was sent to the Operations and Situation Centre and to the Freiburg regional government office, which was also informed by telephone.At the same time, a press release was issued to the local press.
The industrial measurements team measured hydrogen cyanide at various measuring points around the site. At all measuring points, zero was measured, including on the site of a neighbouring company, where a person claimed to have noticed a bitter almond smell shortly beforehand.
The police arrived at 08:24 and conducted interviews as appropriate. In consultation with the divisional police commander, it was confirmed that there was no need to alert the population.A conversation was held with the municipality at 08:50 to ensure that information was flowing as it should.
At 08:35, the D2 final notification was given. A final press release was issued at 09:05.The main part of the building concerned was released by the fire brigade at 09:07. Part of the staff organisation continued to work from that time until 18:00.Until then, further information on the state of play was sent to the Freiburg Regional Government Office.From 18:00, the plant was brought into safe condition, following a prior risk analysis, and then switched off. The contaminated roof with a gravel layer was covered with a tarpaulin so that rain would not wash the contamination into the rainwater system.
Cause/sequence of eventsThe oxazolamide in quinoline solution was supplied at a temperature of 146 °C (as in normal operation).As intended, it was then cooled to 90 °C. 1,375 kg of phosphorus pentoxide was added as intended from a steel container via a charging hopper.
During the dosing process there was an exceptionally exothermic reaction in the stirrer container with a temperature above 203 °C and pressure rise of more than 0.5 bar.This led to the release of reaction mass via the feed line into the production site and the scrubber system.The safety valve on the roof also tripped.
A quantity of approximately 500 to a maximum of 900 litres (conservatively estimated) of reaction mixture was released. This consists of: approx. 45% quinoline, 40% oxazolnitril/oxazolamide, 15% phosphoric acid / phosphorus pentoxide. Traces of hydrogen cyanide are also present in this mixture.
Safety measures:After the phosphorus pentoxide was introduced into the stirrer tank, the shut-off valve (gate) of the stirring tank closed. A safety valve tripped due to the further pressure build-up in the stirrer tank.The fire alarm was triggered by the release of the reaction mass in the production area. The fire brigade used water to precipitate vapours around the safety valve.","The investigation into the root cause or analysis of the event follows various sources of error and cause. The possible causes are:

problems with the quality of raw materials (phosphorus pentoxide, quinoline);
a different composition of the intermediate product and thus the composition of the reaction mixture in the reactor involved;
water as a trigger for the violent reaction with phosphorus pentoxide;
operational errors in the operation of the installation in question.

These possible issues give rise to different hypotheses, of which any one or several in combination may be the cause of the event. The facts and results have been analysed in a cause map.
The most likely cause of the event is the abnormal composition of the intermediate stage (excessive residual water moisture) in combination with the reduced drying due to the incorrect indication on the pressure gauge. This means that sufficient water was still available to react vigorously with the phosphorus pentoxide and possibly also with the oxazolnitril that had already formed.
Combination of technical failure (pressure indicator) with previous abnormalities in the process.","As a precaution, one person was sent to the occupational health service and observed there. No health impairment was found.
Contamination of the inside of the building.Costs: EUR 100,000","Fire brigade alerted and emergency response activated. Evacuation of the building, cordoning off and securing, fire brigade's firefighting water retained. Municipal fire brigade alerted. Measurements by industrial measurement teams of pollutants inside and outside the operational area.
Support with staff wearing respirators and liaison with the municipality.","A number of measures to make the process safer have been identified. Measures will also be implemented that do not affect the actual, most likely cause, but also further minimise all other possible and conceivable risks due to technical defects and operator errors. This will further reduce the residual risk.
An analytical control of the approach to oxazolnitril (in-process control) for the water content immediately prior to the addition of phosphorus pentoxide is important here. If water in this process can be sufficiently excluded by analysis, an uncontrolled reaction of water with phosphorus pentoxide cannot occur.The sampling point will be selected in an appropriate manner and the method of analysis will be qualified according to the current standard.
In addition, various additional level measurements will be installed in the installation and piping system to indicate the presence of water from cooling backflows, etc. and to alert staff promptly."

As a consequence of the extinguishing operations a white precipitate (extinguishing foam with traces of Ludigol) deposited in the neighbouring residential area.Approximately 90 minutes before the explosion occurred the&nbsp; gas operation of the&nbsp; spray nozzles in the dryer was switched over from nitrogen to ambient air. A few minutes before the explosion occurred the smell of sulphur dioxide was noticed:Brown smoke (nitric gas) was released by the roof exhaust of the dryer.The bursting plate ruptured a few seconds before the dryer shell burst.Approximately 200 empty 200 litre polyethylene drums caught fire due to the explosion. ,"Causes : Sokalan ( a cross-linked Polyvinylpyrrolidone - PVP) ignited in a heat exchanger due to atmospheric air feed. Approximately 90 minutes elapsed after the change from nitrogen to atmospheric air before Sokalan ignited, due to the fact that the dryer temperature on the cold side of the heat-exchanger was below 160°C.&nbsp; At low ambient temperatures Sokalan starts oxidising slowly, so that a certain amount of time elapses before ignition.Burning Sokalan was then transported by the gas stream into the dryer. The substance was first redirected&nbsp; by the so-called "" Chinese hat"" collector to the bottom part of the dryer.&nbsp; Up to 40 kg Ludigol (m-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt CAS-Nr.: 127-68-4) dust from the closed loop dryer gas had deposited in that space. The burning sokalan met the ludigol dust&nbsp; inducing it's decomposition. The ludigol fire expanded over the dust layer towards the fluidised bed where another 40-50 kg ludigol decomposed. The fast accelerating uncontrolled decomposition reaction increased the pressure, despite the gas&nbsp; release through the rupture disk, causing the dryer shell to burst at a internal pressure of approximately 1.5 bar.","Onsite material losses: destruction of the dryer, damage by the resulting fire;
off-site material losses: cars damaged, loss of revenue in the local food industry, exposed fruits and vegetables, cleaning of dwellings.
",Protective measures: arrival of the on-site fire brigade and start of fire extinguishing operations.,"Measures  to prevent recurrence: Different substances can be dried in a closed loop gas dryer  only if:
- possible product residues / deposits cannot cause hazardous conditions or
- the dryer has to be built in such a manner that  complete cleaning can be guaranteed.

1113,1085,Near Miss,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,H2s Exposure of personnel,2016-10-12 16:05:00,2016-10-12 17:05:00,"Wednesday&nbsp;12.10.2016 at&nbsp;16:05 the control room in the plant was informed about an accident in the terminal in connection with work on an H2S-reactor&nbsp;in the water purification unit.
Since monday 10th there had been operational problems with the H2S-reactor, sludge had accumulated at the bottom of the reactor, and this was being removed by blowing pressurized air to the bottom of the reactor.
Two morning shift operators discovered that H2S values on top of the reactor were too high, and communicated this to their colleagues in the shift, but failed to register the information in the shift log, and also forgot to inform about this at the shift handover.
The&nbsp;afternoon shift was undermanned, the shift leader was off duty and was replaced with a coordinator from another shift. This coordinator also had other duties on this shift, which was not allowed according to internal procedures, and a third person took over his role, but this was not communicated to the shift. They were als two operators short, and two students who were on a placement program also followed the shift. There was also an operator trainee on the shift. One of the regular operators (operator 1) had been working for many years at a neighbouring plant, but had his second day at work&nbsp;in this plant.&nbsp;
At the start of the afternoon shift, the daily tasks were discussed with the coordinator. Blowing the H2S reactor with&nbsp;pressurized air was one of the tasks, and the new operator was given information on how to perform this job. He took with him the trainee and the two placement students to do the job, and was followed by a trained operator (operator 2). The two operators climbed to the top of the reactor, and the trainee and the students were told to wait at ground level, but this was misunderstood and they also climbed to the top of the tank. Entering the top of the tank the two operators felt a strong smell of H2S, but as they had not been told about the high H2S-values during shift handover, they did not bring with them protective equipment. Seconds after the trainee and students had entered the top, one of the students fainted. The new operator reported this to the control room. The control room alarmed both the internal and external rescue services, and the shift coordinator&nbsp;took&nbsp;lead of the internal rescue team. Internal personnel equipped with chemical-diving equipment arrived at the location, and&nbsp;by then the trainee and the second student had managed to climb down from the reactor. Operator 1 had also started to feel bad and climbed dow. He fainted on the way down and landed on a&nbsp;platform, gained consciousness a llittle later and managed to climb down. Operator 2 also felt ill,&nbsp;lost consiousness for a couple of minutes and woke up again on top of the unconsious student. The internal rescue team discovered upon arrival that they had brought one breathing device that did not function, grabbed some spare parts from a first aid kit and climbed to the top of the reactor. One of them had to climb down fairly quickly due to an empty&nbsp;oxygen bottle. It was a hectic situation, with a lot of things going wrong, until the local rescue services arrived at 16:25&nbsp;
People from the internal emergency response team and from the local fire rescue services managed to get the student down, and he was transported by helicopter to the&nbsp;hospital. The four others were sent by ambulance to the hospital.&nbsp;","The cause of the operational problems in the water purification unit&nbsp;is not important here. The authorities investigation looked at how this situation with 5 people being exposed could occure, and concluded the following:

lack of internal control regarding activities, rescources, process and competency.&nbsp;
insufficient manning and competency&nbsp;in the new shift
insufficient shift handover, important information was not handed over
operational management of emergency&nbsp;organisation
insufficient training in the use of emergency equipment
insufficient&nbsp;planning on how to rescue personell from&nbsp;tall structures
Non functioning radio communication
","In total five people were sent to hospital. Four of them were discharged after 24 hours, the placement student stayed in hospital for 3 days.
Since H2S is a very poisonous substance&nbsp;it was pure luck that nobody died, and very&nbsp;fortunate that none of them so far have experienced delayed negative health effects. High exposure can cause damages to the nervous system, and damages to lungs.
No economical, operational or environmental consequences.","There were a lot of problems with the emergency response. Inadequate&nbsp;operational management of the emergency&nbsp;organisation,&nbsp;insufficient training in the use of emergency equipment,&nbsp;insufficient&nbsp;planning on how to rescue people from&nbsp;tall structures, non functioning radio communication.","
Activities, rescources, process and competency must be managed in a way that secures safe working conditions.&nbsp;
Sufficient manning and competency of&nbsp;all shifts&nbsp;is necessary in order&nbsp;to ensure safe operation.
Important information must always be logged in the shift protocol and mentioned in the shift hand over. Had this been done, the operators would not have climbed to the top of the reactor without bringing the necessary protective equipment.&nbsp;
In&nbsp;the handling of the emergency situation it is important that:

the organisation and responsibilities are clearly defined
necessary training in the use of emergency equipment is performed
necessary planning on how to rescue personell from&nbsp;tall structures is performed and described
well functioning radio communication

1114,1087,Major Accident,Chemical installations - ammonia,Syngas compressor oil tank explosion,2017-04-24 02:40:00,2017-04-24 07:00:00,"On the 24th of April 2017, at 2.43 am, a trip occurred in&nbsp;an ammonia plant due to an&nbsp;external power supply fluctuation. The dip lasted 0,4 seconds. This fluctuation caused automatic&nbsp;shutdown of the plant, a normal shut-down operation was&nbsp;performed, and flammable content&nbsp;flared off. After having stabilized the process, the production shift were preparing the plant&nbsp;for&nbsp;restart. All seemed to be normal, restart procedures are followed,&nbsp;but at&nbsp;03:15 an explosion occurs, followed by an intense oil&nbsp;fire in the compressor hall. Two operators are present, and evacuate without&nbsp;physical injuries.&nbsp;Internal and external fireservices are on site shortly&nbsp;after, and 45 minutes later the fire is extinguished, and they can see that the main syngas oiltank&nbsp;(lubricant oil) has «torn» and that the fire can be localized to&nbsp;this tank.&nbsp;
Immediate consequence on people&nbsp;was limited to psychological impact (one&nbsp;employee in a long sick leave). In terms of environment there was a limited oil&nbsp;release to the fjord that&nbsp;was rapidly taken care of. Extensive damages have been observed in the electrical/instrumentation systems and in the compressor hall.&nbsp;","The initial power fluctuation did not cause the accident, but&nbsp;initiated the shut down.
The direct cause is the generation of an explosive and highly sensitive atmosphere in&nbsp;the vapour phase of the main oil tank, because&nbsp;Oxygen enriched air came into the nitrogen purging system from&nbsp;the Air Separation Unit.
The main root cause:&nbsp;an uncontrolled Management Of Change on the air&nbsp;separation unit trip system that allowed enriched air to be sent in the nitrogen grid. The nitrogen grid was supposed to be a safety barrier in the syngas compressor oil tank explosion scenario.– a low suction pressure trip had been removed some years back (2011), but was still mentioned in both P&amp;ID and standard operating&nbsp;procedure.&nbsp;
Contributing factors:– Lack of Process Hazard Analysis that generated inadequate standard operating&nbsp;procedure and inadequate training.– Lack of proper alarm management program and poor human machine&nbsp;interface
&nbsp;","Immediate consequence on people are limited to psychological impact (one&nbsp;employee in a long sick leave). In terms of environment there&nbsp;was a limited oil&nbsp;release to the fjord that&nbsp;was rapidly cleaned. For the asset part,&nbsp;extensive damages have been observed in the electrical/instrumentation systems.&nbsp;Large fire damages on building, no damages caused by overpressure. The oil tank is to be reconstructed. Main compressor train was effectively protected&nbsp;by the water mist system. The cost estimate is around 165 MNOK, and the&nbsp;reconstruction period was 4 months. Reputational impact&nbsp;was limited.
&nbsp;","Emergency response was adequate both from the operating shift who rapidly&nbsp;stopped the process and activated the mitigation systems and from the emergency&nbsp;response team who safely and promptly extinguished the fire in the compressor&nbsp;building.&nbsp;
The on site water mist system worked. Due to an open door, foam leaked out from the building.
&nbsp;","An uncontrolled MOC and a lack of process hazard analysis in connection with a change, generated&nbsp;inadequate standard operating procedures and inadequate training. a lack of a propaer alarm management program and a poor human machine interface."
1115,85,Near Miss,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Release of orthodichlorobenzene (ODCB) in a toluene diisocyanate (TDI) production plant,2013-04-24 07:00:00,2013-04-24 00:00:00,"On 24&nbsp;April 2013, there was a release of orthodichlorobenzene (ODCB) from an ODCB cold system after fixing screws failed and a cover plate was torn from a manual locking valve.
The ODCB released was collected in a basin and pumped into a special emergency tank via a waste water pit.There was no outgassing of the ODCB (low temperature and water cover in the waste water pit).
- The malfunction was detected when a volume alarm was activated in the ODCB cold system.- The ODCB released was drained into the basin in a controlled manner and then pumped to the special emergency tank.- As a precaution, the plant fire service was deployed to precipitate any aerosols.- An air pollution measuring vehicle was deployed at the plant boundary downwind from the leak.","The release of the orthodichlorobenzene (ODCB) was caused by broken cover screws on a manual valve in the ODCB cold system due to chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking.The local concentration of the damage is due to the partially restricted, critical corrosion conditions resulting from high local chloride contamination and a low pH value (TDI residue dust, sea air containing chloride, nearby hydrochloric acid electrolysis plant) in connection with prolonged humidification (rainwater, cleaning water and temperature of the ODCB cold system), which prevents rapid drying.
According to the above description of the causes, both the operating conditions and the environmental conditions were responsible for causing the incident.","Manual valve, waste ODCB","- The production plant was shut down to make it safe.- As a precaution, the plant fire service was deployed to precipitate any liquid aerosol.As a precaution, a warning was issued in the areas downwind from the leak (own production areas and neighbouring companies).- A D1 signal was transmitted to the district control centre.- An air pollution measuring vehicle was deployed at the plant boundary downwind from the leak.- The leaked ODCB was pumped into the special emergency tank.
The manual valve was replaced, as was the ODCB which had leaked out.Members of the plant fire service and plant staff who had replaced the manual valve were decontaminated in the basin.A pipe section with traces of the ODCB was rinsed and the rinse water was disposed of in the biological waste water treatment plant.","
Installation of a filter at the point of discharge of the TDI residue to minimise possible chloride contamination through TDI residue dust.


Replacement of (similar) cover screws on all valves of the ODCB cold system.Using screws made of a different material was considered but deliberately ruled out, since, on the one hand, there is a high potential for corrosion on contact with the higher-alloy casing material when screws made of non-alloy and low-alloy material are used and, on the other, there is a high risk of confusion during maintenance when higher-alloy materials are used, in particular in the case of standard components such as screws, due to their very similar appearance.


Proper functioning of the cover screws will in future be ensured by periodically inspecting the screws on the valves of the ODCB cold system in the relevant part of the plant, in accordance with an inspection schedule agreed with the authority.The nature and scope of the inspection programme will be periodically assessed in close coordination with the authority on the basis of the results obtained, and will be improved if necessary.


In other areas of the TDI plant, a representative sample of valves of the same design, distributed over the entire system, was selected to identify any damage to cover screws.


A representative sample of valves of the same design, distributed over the entire system, was selected to identify any damage to flange screws.


Furthermore, the company group instigated an inspection of cover screws on selected valves in other establishments on the site and in other TDI plants worldwide.


The operator was also kept informed of the examination of the case, the causes identified of the damage and the corrective measures taken.

In the present case, the consequences were limited to the basin and no additional measures were necessary."
1116,626,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire affecting the heavy fuel purification plant of a refinery,2005-09-01 21:40:00,2005-09-02 01:45:00,"On 1/09/2005 at 21:40 a fire broke out affecting the heavy fuel purification plant of the refinery.The company made following statements concerning the accident.The shift personnel present testified that a strong hiss was heard lasting a few seconds which was followed with the ignition of the released product and that there had not been any noticeable pressure changes (like pressure waves etc.). The shift personnel present onsite and in particular the shift foreman who was staying on the main access ramp to the atmospheric distillation plants, testified that he saw the jet-fire ignite from the top and propagate down (from approx 18m above ground down to approx 14m in the area comprised between the exchangers E1718 A/B/C and the reactor R1702). Immediately the shift foreman activated the onsite emergency plan and informed the gate guard in order to alert the fire brigade. At 21:40 the fire brigade was alerted. The jet fire affected the quench-line with the 3"" hydrogen pipe, which ruptured after 6 min. exposure with the consequent ignition of the hydrogen. The fire took a cylindrical form from the bottom to the top starting at 14 m height affecting above located plant parts, comprising under other the pre-heater of the diathermic oil. Approx 30 minutes after the fire ignited a 8"" fuel pipe of the diathermic oil system ruptured and subsequent ignition of the product. The fire was kept under control and evolved without noticeable changes until consumption of the fuel once the pipes were shut off according to the emergency response plan which had been activated. The fire was extinguished at 1:20 h on 02/09/2005 (3 hours and 40 minutes after the fire initiated) and the state of emergency was called off by the fire brigade at 1:45 h.No damages to persons has been reported consequent to the accident.According to damage evaluations performed, there has not been any environmental damage, this evaluation has been confirmed also by an environmental indicators assessment performed by ARPA of Genoa.","Following the results of the investigation performed by the company and the analysis of an amateur video, the company has formulated following assumptions concerning the accident.The accident, considering the products processed, could have originated by the failure of one of the following plant components.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pipes leading to the pressure gauges of reactor R-1702-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recycled gas pipe at the bottom of the reactor R-1702 having a quench function-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diathermic oil pipe (hot oil) entering or exiting the exchanger-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flanged joints exchanger E-1718, E-1709 and connection linesThe company excludes a release from the hot oil circuit as triggering factor of the fire, basing on the evidence gathered from the records on the pressure in the circuit which demonstrate the failure 30 min after fire start. Also the video confirms ù the pipe rupture 30 min after fire begin.For the same reason a release from the hydrogen pipes it is not considered likely, the records demonstrate that the hydrogen pipe failed 7 min after fire begin.Concerning the flange joints of exchangers E-1718, E-1719 experts requested the dismounting of the exchanger flanged joints, the joint gaskets resulted to be not damaged.For this reason the company considers the failure of a pipe from the pressure measurement gauges of reactor R-1702 as the most likely accident triggering factor, this assumption is supported by the following facts:1: this part is located in the area corresponding to the epicentre of the fire2: the area corresponds to the area visually identified by the witnesses3 the product release (hydrogen an fuel oil) from one of this pipes can cause a 6 m long jet flame as occurred.4. the product supposedly released would have had a high enough temperature and pressure to self-self-ignite or ignite against a hot spot of the plant like the hot oil circuit.5: the damages recorded are caused by overheating (flame exposition) and were not caused by overpressure or explosion-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pressure measurement records confirm significant pressure changes at the beginning of the event.The company does not have any element allowing to identify the failure cause of that pipe.","The fire has caused damage to the structures of the unit and has not affected other units of the refinery.There have not been any damages to persons or the environment reported.Material damage has been estimated in 5 million Euro for the structures and 7.6 million Euro for the reconstruction, the remediation measures, materials and other related costs.Ecological Harm - Remarks:In the area around the establishment there are measuring stations controlled by IPLOM which is controlled by local authorities (province)The analysis of data gathered by the measuring stations downwind of the release point did not indicate any relevant environmental damage.The company refers, that the analysis of environmental indicators performed by ARPAL of Genoa document that there has not been any relevant environmental consequence.Community Disruption - Remarks:Train circulation between Genoa and Arquata was stopped by the railway company although the this measure had not been requested by the authorities inn charge with the emergency response.The interruption of the highway Genoa-Milan at the height of Genova-Bolzaneto and the pay toll Ronco Scrivia was requested by the competent authorities as precautionary measure in order to facilitate the access and circulation of emergency response vehicles.The event did not have any off-site consequences, but had a large resonance in the media principally in local media also due to a large diffusion of the news and an parliamentary interrogation.Affected Area: installation","The onsite emergency response service of that shift was composed by six persons having following functions:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shift manager in charge with the emergency management2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gate guard responsible for the external communication3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st&nbsp; product transfer operator in charge with fire fighting4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2nd product transfer operator with fire fighting5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd distillation plant worker in charge with fire fighting 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5th processing plant worker in charge with fire fightingAll the team assisted by the other shift personnel forming the operative team, participated from the beginning of the event in implementing the&nbsp; emergency response.The operative team of the shift was constituted by 8 workers with the following functions.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shift foreman coordinator responsible for securing the installations.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distillation plant Q1 control-room operator responsible for securing the plant from the control-room3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Processing plants Q2 control-room operator responsible for securing the plant from the control-room4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st&nbsp; distillation worker responsible for securing the installation equipment5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd services operator responsible for securing the installation equipment6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Processing plant operator responsible for securing the installation equipment7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shift foreman in charge with product transfer responsible for the securing of the storage facilities.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd product transfer operator responsible for securing the Boccarda storageAfter approx. 3 minutes from beginning of the event the fire brigade of Bussalla (a team with 6 fire fighters) arrived on-site, subsequently arrived fire brigades from Bolzaneto, Genoa and Novi Ligure with a total of 50 fire fighters.Seveso II duties  - remarks: The off-site emergency plan in

Official action taken - legal action: An investigation on the accident and a judicial procedure were under way at the time this report was issuedThe main measures taken were-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seizure of the plant section involved in the accident on 02/09/2005 (confirmed on 03/09/2005-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nomination of an expert group and start of the accident investigation-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seizure withdrawal of the plant section involved in the accident on 21/10/2005At the time of this report the results of the investigation were not available and no further judicial measures were taken.","Immediate lessons learned  - Description: The operator decided to rebuilt the plant with a new executive project , in consideration of the damage caused to the plant, maintaining the same production layout.The new executive project foresees essentially:- the complete separation of the light fuel oil section and the heavy fuel section such to avoid for example the possibility of domino effects- lowering the maximum height for the installation of exchangers from 25 m to 15 such to facilitate fire extinguishing operations- reconstruction of the plant in compliance with the PED directive (CE n° 97/23) - rotionalising the piping system to minimise adjacencies, relocate valves on the hydrogen quench line in R1072 to maintain the line depressurised, reduce the number of measurement gauges and insertion of valves in a safe area for depressurising the hot oil circuit."
1117,870,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Loss of containement of 100 kg of piperidine,2011-05-24 01:30:00,2011-05-24 17:00:00,"The accident took place on 24/05/2011 around 1:30 in the transhipment hall. Workers were busy loading a truck trailer via a loading kay. The first pallet on which was a 170 kg drum with piperidine was placed on the bottom of the trailer: the drum was placed on a pallet, a second pallet was placed vertically behind the barrel, the whole was wrapped together to immobilize the drum on the pallet. The worker had to place the next pallet with a forklift in front of the pallet on which stood the drum with piperidine. The forks of the forklift pierced the drum with piperidine at a height of 40 cm (55 cm above the floor level of the trailer). The storekeeper warned his colleague who entered the trailer and found the leak and a strong odor. ","When loading the truck, the storekeeper moved with his forklift with the forks positioned about 55 cm above ground level. Since the truck was positioned at a loading kay which allowed level acces there was no need to raise the forks for this opertation.He therefore did not comply with the safety rule for mobile vehicles that says to ""run empty and loaded with forks 15 cm from the ground."" This rule, however, is well reflected in the warehouse manual that he should have received and signed to confrim he took knowledge of it.The warehouse worker was a temporary worker. He had been directly employed to the post of storekeeper in the night shift (17:00- 1:30). It was also his first day of work on the site. In addition, the colleague was not an experienced worker, he was also a new worker, in function only for a month and a half as storekeeper.","Loss of containment of just over 100 kg of piperidine, flammable and toxic by inhalation and contact: leak contained and removed by dilution and removal of the mixture and absorption with sand. Seven workers were hospitalized preventively for 36 h, they remained under observation because there is a risk of developing pulmonary oedema with this substance. Finally, there is no lesion seen for these seven people.These workers were:- the 2 operators loading the truck who were exposed when the drum was pierced.- 3 people of the internal intervention team who explored the situation whithout resperatory protection - 2 people who were in the neighbourhoodEvacuation of the whole site and a security perimeter was set up by police around the site.","Orally, the team leaders evacuated the transhipment hall. A team leader entered the trailer of the truck to check the damage. The team leaders then fitted mask cartridges and boots in order to intervene in the truck. These internal intervention team entered the truck, placed the damaged drum in a oversized drum, took it out of the truck and scattered sand on the spill in the truck. The oversized drum was closed and placed at the entrance hall outside. Some of the liquid was found in the drain beneath the loading docks, the drain is connected to the retention basin.The prevention advisor then arrived on the spot. The intervention team proceeded then to the identification of the product in the drum: it was a drum in transit (arrived on 23/05/2011, stored temporarily in the hall and departure on 24/05/2011), the only information available on the product was those listed on the CMR (but the CMR was not directly available) and on the label on the drum itself. The product name, piperidine, was then spotted on the barrel itself. The prevention advisor then searched the MSDS in the computer system via a computer in the administrative office of the transhipment hall, but without success and then via internet, but without success also because Internet access was not possible . He then went into the main administrative offices located at the other end of the site. He returned with the MSDS of the product found on the Internet.In consultation with the internal intervention team, it was decided not to continue the intervention (dilution and removal of the remaining product with water to the fire retention pond), but to call to the external fire departement.A security perimeter was internally created (notably to prevent truck access to the site).The prevention advisor welcomed the firefighters and provided the link with the emergency services. Firefighters then established their command post.The chemical intervention cell was deployed by the fire departement and an intervention strategy was put in place: two firemen equipped with chemical proof overalls and breathing apparatus was then sent into the truck in reconnaissance, before setting up the actual response : cleaning the truck, rinsing and dilution.A security perimeter was set up by police around the site during these operations.It remained necessary to remove the diluted product that was collected in the retention pond: there was a consultation with the client on residual risks of the product diluted with water and finally a test was performed on a sample of the mixture water + product to determine if the mixture was still flammable. As this was not the case, the mixture could be pumped into a tanker truck and then be removed.","More consistent formation of temporary workersNo more temporary workers put the first day to work during night shiftsBetter access on safety information about the products in transit: all goods in transit warehouses are not accompanied by an MSDS. Only security Tremcards are available. These include very general safety instructions and not always accompany the goods (Tremcards are stored in the cabin of the vehicle). This finding is similar for all goods in transit through the territory. Therefore, in case of intervention, research on the internet (very common product in this case) of the MSDS seems like a good solution.More consistant training module for all the staff presenting the hazards of chemicals and including a detailed explanation of personal protective equipment needed in case of intervention and an explanation of the methods of dressing upMore specific training module for intervention crew, including detailed explanation of the MSDS and consultation of MSDS via the stock program and detailed explanations of response procedures"

The only damage was caused by the water, which reached a height of 10 cm, and in places up to 1.5 m.",Flooding of the Seine following heavy rains.,"The site was shut down: utilities (gas, electricity) were cut off, and the effluent treatment plant (STEP) was shut down, IT equipment was moved to higher ground, sensitive stock and trucks awaiting deliveries were evacuated...
Despite this, the following fixed equipment was affected: pumps, motors and transformers. The material damage and production losses amounted to EUR 2 million. Roads exposed to the flood waters were also eroded by the current, empty drums were caught up in the flood waters and tore out sections of fence, the plant's electrical facilities were overflowed by more than 10 cm of water, fixed pumps and motors that became submerged had to be repaired or replaced, and the network for transmitting safety information from the storage areas to the control room became unusable (fire detection, measurement of the level in the site's 20 tanks and a nitrogen inerting device).
","The site was shut down before the flood waters arrived.
Access to the site was restricted during the flooding.
","The site was well prepared and had been shut down by the time the flood waters arrived, making it possible to minimise damage.
The flooding also revealed problems with leak-resistance in the oldest retention areas, where 3 to 15 cm of water were found at the foot of the tanks despite the presence of low retaining walls. See also ARIA N° 43784

1120,936,Major Accident,Production and storage of fireworks,"Esplosione massiva presso uno stabilimento di produzione e stoccaggio di fuochi d'artificio, in area deposito prodotti finiti",2013-07-25 10:15:00,2013-08-02 20:00:00,"At 10.15 a.m. on the morning of 25&nbsp;July 2013, a series of explosions occurred in the finished products storage area of a fireworks factory. The initial explosions - three explosions in short succession according to calls from members of the public to the fire service [VVF] - presumably occurred in the vicinity of sheds No&nbsp;4 and 5, which were used to store finished products (fireworks), classified as category&nbsp;IV and V under the National legislation regulating explosive factories and warehouses. Observations of the effects indicate that the sheds probably exploded en masse, i.e. involving all the material contents of the sheds simultaneously. The fire service's findings suggest that, at the time of the explosion, several factory employees - including the manager and two employees related to him, who were killed instantaneously - were loading products from the storage sheds onto vehicles parked nearby. Ignition presumably occurred during the handling of the explosives. It seems that the products being loaded were to be transferred onwards onto vans parked in the yard in front of the entrance gates for shipment to the venues where they would be used, since the vans had been partially loaded but still had to be fully loaded. In the days preceding the accident, the factory had been particularly busy preparing and shipping products for many planned fireworks displays; in particular, a fireworks display for a local festival was planned for the following day. At 10.55 a.m. there was a fourth explosion, in a delayed domino effect, in shed No&nbsp;8, which was used to store up to 9600&nbsp;kg of category IV and V explosive material. The shed, already damaged by the shock wave from the initial explosions, was probably struck by burning debris thrown out by ongoing minor secondary blasts, and it too probably exploded en masse together with all the contents. This last explosion caused the death of a fourth employee (the son of the manager), who was hit by section of the roof of shed No&nbsp;8, and caused serious injuries to a fire-fighter working at the scene, who later died from the injuries. In total, the event caused the death of 4&nbsp;factory employees, serious injuries to a fire-fighter, who died in hospital approximately three months later, and injuries to 3&nbsp;employees and 5&nbsp;fire-fighters, who were all hospitalised and subsequently recovered. The accident caused extensive material damage, with the factory's sheds destroyed almost completely, damage to civilian facilities adjacent to the factory perimeter and related to the factory, and damage to external civilian buildings within a radius of up to 1&nbsp;km. Debris of various sizes from the sheds which exploded was found within a radius of up to 1&nbsp;km. Lastly, the explosions caused environmental damage as they set off a series of large-scale forest fires in the surrounding natural and rural area within a radius of 500&nbsp;m which were later extinguished by the fire service and the State Forestry Corps, deploying two aircraft. The main local authorities (including the Prefecture, the Carabinieri, the police department, the judiciary [judicial inspection] and the local health authority) intervened at the scene. No action was apparently taken by the Regional Planning and Environment Office to measure soil contamination due to chemicals dispersed as a result of the explosions.","In tandem with the MARS inspection, the incident is currently being investigated by the local Public Prosecutor’s Office, and the official expert [CTU] appointed by the Public Prosecutor is drawing up the official expert report. As part of the judicial investigation, the area of the factory was sealed off and the company documentation on the premises at the time of the event was seized. As a result, although MARS inspectors were able to enter the sealed area (subject to prior authorisation from the PM at the request of the fire service), they have not been able to access the company's documentation. Given the above circumstances, it is only possible to formulate hypotheses on the causes of the accident, based on the information collected and measurements taken after the event by the inspection committee in the course of its inspection and making use of the data provided by several of the public authorities involved in post-accident operations, chiefly the local fire service and the Commander of the Carabinieri. Additional hypotheses have been put forward on the basis of information drawn from the interview with the manager's representative, the appointed expert [CTP], it being impossible to consult either the manager or his employees/family members (who were killed by the explosion). Some surviving relatives are still in a state of shock and receiving psychiatric treatment. The hypothetical conclusions based on post-accident data collected by the fire service and the Carabinieri are set out below. In the process of securing the location after the accident, primed explosive products (already fitted with electric fuses but not connected to a power supply) were found in the factory yard in front of the factory entrance and in the tool shed used as a garage for vans. It was not possible to identify the kind of primers and, consequently, if they were allowed or not inside the plant according with the national regulations. In general, under the national regulations fireworks must never be pre-armed inside the establishment. Considering the material damage sustained by the internal structures, in particular by the sheds with load-bearing walls made from reinforced concrete, and the containment walls, with evidence of disintegration and crushing, the probability is that there was a sympathetic detonation of the explosive material or an instantaneous explosion involving the entire quantity of material due to mechanical stress: this can be compatible with the potential presence in the area of the explosions of quantities of explosive products already, it is assumed, unlawfully primed. It should be added that, according to the statement of the Commander of the Carabinieri, explosive material, including primed material, was also found in the area belonging to the manager's residence and, specifically, in the vans parked in the tool shed and, lastly, fireworks were found in the basement of the tool shed. Considering the above hypotheses, it is possible to suppose that the operating procedures deployed by the company were unsafe, as also supported by the conclusions of a previous SMS inspection conducted by local Authority in 2012, which pointed out the absence of adequate operative procedures and instructions for managing the explosives production in safe conditions, in each stage of process. This aspect goes beyond the lack of information and training provided to operators who, as experts in the field may be deemed to be well aware of the dangers of handling primed materials; it suggests, rather, an excessive level of ‘confidence’ gained over time and perhaps overfamiliarity with work involving materials that in fact entail a high level of intrinsic risk. To this may be added the probable situation of working under pressure, subject to constraints of time and space, in the days immediately preceding the event on account of the many orders for firework displays which the operators themselves were called upon to carry out by virtue of their acknowledged reputation in the sector. Furthermore, given the extent of the material damage sustained by external structures impacted by debris from the disintegration of the sheds and protective walls, and based on a damage assessment by applying the TNT equivalent method to the case in point, considering the maximum quantity authorised within a shed, it may be hypothesised that the quantity of explosive in the stores at the time of the event exceeded the quantity permitted by the competent authority. Applying the above method with a highly conservative approximation of the case leads to the conclusion that the structural damage due to the pressure wave compatible with that observed on the outside buildings damaged ought to lie within a radius of less than 107&nbsp;m; however, damage of this kind (lifting of the building's wooden roof, cornerstone movement, curtain wall damage, partition wall damage) were found at a radius of between 100&nbsp;m and 500&nbsp;m from the craters made by the explosions. Furthermore, on the subject of the quantity of explosives in stock, according to information reported by the Commander of the Carabinieri approximately 20&nbsp;days after the event (13&nbsp;August) some 0.2 tonnes of black powder were found stored in five drums in an abandoned hut outside the factory adjacent to the southern perimeter. There were no labels on the drums. This amount, together with the 0.43 tons found in shed No&nbsp;2 following the explosion, would exceed the authorised limit of 0.5 tonnes for black powder. Lastly, we should stress the domino effect of the initial explosions upon shed No&nbsp;8, first hit by the shock wave and then ignited, presumably by burning debris. In theory, compliance with National Regulations with regard to the distances between sheds should have prevented a domino effect of this kind but only if the authorised maximum quantities and types of explosives were also respected. These considerations again point to the root cause being the breach of safety requirements in terms of the quantity and type of explosive material authorised and/or stored and processed in the establishment. This is supported by the conclusions of the incident report drawn up by the local fire service, which managed the emergency response to the event. On the basis of information obtained from interviews with surviving relatives not currently in a psychological condition to have dealings with the inspection committee, the appointed expert [CTP] representing the manager reports that the operator was regularly asked to store (Authority request) quantities of explosive material entrusted to its legal custody after being confiscated by the police. This material,may be, in general, not well identified and consequently with an unknown (and potentially dangerous) behaviour, was stored in the sheds together with explosive products manufactured by the company. In particular, at the time of the accident, the appointed expert [CTP] reports that the stores held a quantity of confiscated explosive material roughly equivalent to 6 or 7&nbsp;tons, in storage sheds No&nbsp;4 and No&nbsp;5 (where the initial series of explosions was found to have occurred). So the appointed expert [CTP] declares that the origin of explosions is probably attributable to the chemical decomposition of explosive material delivered into the company's legal custody by the police, stored in sheds No&nbsp;4 and No&nbsp;5 together with the company's own finished products. He therefore highlights the critical significance of the storage of unidentified confiscated explosive material which, as it loses chemical stability over time, presents an increased risk of explosive decomposition.","The accident caused extensive human, property and environmental damage: Human damages occurred within the establishment, comprising the instant death of 3&nbsp;members of staff (including the manager) hit by the first series of explosions, the instantaneous death of a fourth member of staff (the manager's son) who had returned to to the establishment to look for his missing father and was struck by debris ejected from the fourth explosion, serious injuries suffered by a fire-fighter hit by the fourth explosion who died in hospital three months later, and injuries sustained by 3&nbsp;employees and 5&nbsp;fire-fighters participating in the emergency response. Material damage occurred both inside and outside the factory premises, comprising, internally, the total destruction of almost all the sheds and damage to civilian structures related to the factory and, externally, damage to certain civilian structures (residences, church, cemetery, farm tourism structures) caused by the pressure wave up to a radius of 500&nbsp;m and by the ejection of debris up to a radius of 1&nbsp;km. Environmental damage occurred outside the factory premises, comprising the destruction of forested and agricultural areas up to a radius of approximately 500&nbsp;m from the establishment, extending to a total area of approximately 70&nbsp;hectares as a result of fires ignited by the explosions. In addition, again downstream of the explosions, chemical products (flammable and oxidising) used for mixes that had been kept in sheds No 6 and No 7 were dispersed over an area of outside land adjacent to the enclosure on the south and east sides. Immediately after the last explosion, a mushroom cloud of combustion gases approximately 50&nbsp;m high was observed.","Considering the dynamics of the accident, the effects, and the information provided by the firefighters teams involved in the emergency procedure, it is possible to say that the internal emergency plan was not really activated, and the external emergency was not adequately and quickly requested by the company. Firefighters were called first only by the citizens of surrounding towns, after seeing and hearing explosion effects. In fact, the local firefighters chief reported that it received one call from a survivor component of the company only after 8 calls of citizens. Moreover, after the first explosions, the missing evacuation of the surviving operators inside the plant led to increase the damages.","On the basis of information collected and the reconstruction of the hypothetical chain of events , even though the judicial investigation into the accident is still under way, it is possible to point out the following shortcomings in management: it is possible to suppose that the operating procedures deployed by the company were unsafe, as also supported by the conclusions of a previous SMS inspection conducted by local Authority in 2012, which pointed out the absence of adequate operative procedures and instructions for managing the explosives production in safe conditions, in each stage of process; beyond the lack of information and training provided to operators, who as experts in the field may be deemed to be well aware of the dangers of handling primed materials, an excessive level of ‘confidence’, gained over time and perhaps overfamiliarity with work, involving high level of intrinsic risk materials, came out; given the extent of the material damage sustained by external structures impacted by debris from the disintegration of the sheds and protective walls, and based on a damage assessment by applying the TNT equivalent method to the case in point, it may be hypothesized that the quantity of explosive in the stores at the time of the event exceeded the quantity permitted by the competent authorities. This leads to the hypothesis of a breach of safety requirements with regard to the maximum quantities of dangerous substances kept in store and processed; it should be stressed that the safety distances laid down in the National regulations are valid and upheld only if obligations stemming from them and from safety requirements and safety procedures are also systematically complied with; attention should be drawn to the company's deficient in-house management of the emergency, including its failure to call in the emergency services in good time and failure to detect situations requiring the immediate evacuation of the premises: the failure to evacuate staff from the premises after the initial explosions aggravated the damage caused; as for the damage caused by the ejection of debris, attention should be drawn to the lethal effect of the pieces produced by the break up of the roof of shed No&nbsp;8 which, thanks to their strong but thin metal structure (sandwich panels), when ejected at high speed following the shock wave acted like sharp blades, thus causing the death of one employee. Consequently, the technical issue of the construction features of the roofs on the sheds, also raised in discussions with a police bomb expert, should be noted: although this type of roof is adequate in terms of providing protection and a preferential vent for a shed containing explosive material, it may aggravate the effects of an explosion in the shed in which it is broken into fragments; with regard to the difficulty of emergency service and fire service action during the explosions, it is noted that the presence of a second access route to the works, on the opposite side to the first access route, would have facilitated the positioning of fire-fighting equipment and the management of the emergency response and would significantly have reduced the fire-fighting team's risk of exposure to the shock wave and material debris during the operation. In this connection, the effective coordination of the team, with the fire-fighting units positioned and arranged in such a way as to take advantage the protection offered by the variations in altitude of the terrain on which the sheds were located, and the team's use of PPE (safety helmets, etc.) undoubtedly prevented the situation becoming more costly in terms of damage suffered by the fire-fighters."

The decontamination of plant started.Emergency measures - Remarks: On site fire team and plant personnel extinguished fire and shut off fuel supply to fire (refinery treat gas).Discussion about response: The incident occurred during the activation of a platinum catalyst using refinery treat gas and had several causes. 1. Catalyst activation was not taken into account during the reactor design. 2. A high temperature trip device was not provided. 3. The original risk assessment did not consider the catalyst activation stage and dismissed the possibility of a runaway exothermic reaction.4. During initial plant start-up in 1991 and catalyst activation at 400 degrees Celsius an exotherm was experienced, the cause was identified as hydro cracking of parafins in the treat gas but no further action was taken. 5. In 1994 during a preliminary hot de-waxed treatment at 430 degrees Celsius, temperature indicators were seen to be out of range. No investigation was made. The settings of the temperature indicators was 410 and 450 Celsius although the instruments had a potential maximum of 1000 Celsius. All alarms were set at 405 Celsius. 6. The reactor installation was provided with an emergency shut-down control which was manually activated and required operators to respond correctly to the situation. 7. In May 1994 a new catalyst was to be activated. Temperature 430 Celsius was planned, there was no risk assessment on this change in operating conditions. The first activation was done at 400 Celsius. Refinery change procedures called for a review if there were significant changes in operating conditions but no review was carried out. 8. During the activation stage 3 people went out onto the reactor ladders and platforms at various times, if they had been present when the reactor ruptured they would have been caught by the fire. 9. The causes of the incident can be summed up as follows: &nbsp; (1) Failure to understand the processes occurring in the reactor and the effect of an increase in temperature on the rate of exothermic reactions. &nbsp; (2) Inadequate cooling facilities. &nbsp; (3) An inadequate control system and the absence of a high temperature trip device. &nbsp; (4) Inadequate operational procedures and training of managers, engineers and operators.","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the plant was shut-down and the reactor purged. Its contents was removed and the reactor was prepared to open it to allow an internal examination.

It was found that the temperature indicators on reactor had maximum readings below expected temperatures. Besides, no high temperature trips were fitted.Useful references: very little published information on runaway exotherm in continuous reactors.

The stainless steel treatment vessel was connected to a cast iron holding receiver by both top and bottom connections. The liquid was transferred by the bottom connection and any foam generated during the treatment vented back to the receiver using the top connection. When the treatment method was first adopted, foam had escaped out of the open man lid in the treatment vessel. The man lid was therefore sealed. The foam then passed up the vent system and contaminated the scrubber system. Hence the modification to vent the foam into the receiver. The treatment method for the effluent was provided by the firm's parent company which was specialized in hydrogen peroxide chemistry. The method used was first to add hydrogen peroxide (35%) and then caustic soda solution (25%) to bring the pH up to approximately 9. On some occasions foaming occurred. Management did not fully investigate these incidents; some of the operators were aware of a pressure rise in the treatment vessel if the caustic solution was added too quickly. On a cold Saturday morning in March an explosion occurred within the plant. The lid of the stainless steel vessel was blown off whilst the cast iron receiver was blown to pieces. A process operator nearby at the time was killed. A fire, producing an acidic smoke, then very rapidly spread through the entire building.Research followed the accident showed that the foaming was caused by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, catalyzed by the sulphur compounds in the effluent. The decomposition reaction is also pH-dependent. At about pH=7.5, a rapid exothermic decomposition takes place. The heat produced is capable of vaporizing the various aliphatic alcohols also present in the effluent, producing a potential explosive mixture. This mixture would have filled the head space in the treatment vessel and then spilled into the empty receiver. The source ignition was not fully identified though static or spontaneous ignition could be involved. The bursting discs failed in relief vent lines but from the Original Report it is not fully clear if was a component malfunction or a wrong design. After the accident occurred, the factory had to be demolished.","INITIATING EVENTS AND CONSEQUENCES:An ignition in vessel caused an explosion followed by a serious fire. Ignition was caused by either (a) static discharge in relief vent line or (b) auto ignition of alcohols vapours-hydrogen peroxide in vessel-receiver.&nbsp;&nbsp; CAUSES:The management did not fully investigate the formation of foaming. Researches following the accident showed that the foaming was caused by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. This decomposition was catalysed by sulphur compounds in the effluent and was also pH dependent. At about 7.5 pH a rapid exothermic decomposition takes place. This reaction was not identified during the process analysis of the
deodorization of aqueous organic chemical effluent. The management did not fully investigate the formation of foaming.  The heat produced is capable of vaporizing the various aliphatic alcohols also present in the effluent. This produced a potentially explosive mixture. This mixture would have filled the head space in the treatment vessel and then spilled into the empty receiver. When the Original Report was prepared, the ignition source was not fully identified though static or spontaneous ignition could be involved. The bursting discs failed in relief the vent lines.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:1 person (a process operator nearby the deodorization unit) within the establishment was killed by the explosion.MATERIAL LOSS:The effects of the explosion were contained within the building. The building, containing a multipurpose plant (with reactors, receivers, filters, tanks and assorted services) was engulfed by the fire following the explosion. No data are available about the cost of the damage.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:Local residents were warned to close the doors and the windows because of the acidic smoke produced by the fire.The explosion effects were contained within the building. Though local residents were warned to close doors and windows because of acidic smoke produced by the fire, in the Original Report there is no evidence of significant effects outside the establishment.Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Evacuation of site personnel.

Local residents were warned to close doors and windows because of acidic smoke produced by the fire.No emergency measured are still required, neither on-site nor off-site.","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- the unit to be demolished;
2- process producing the chemical effluent containing strong-smelling sulphur compounds transferred to another factory;
3- a new process for effluent treatment not using hydrogen peroxide to be introduced."

During milling of apertures in the piping, the encircling enclosure that is a gas sealing joint which should guarantee to the atmosphere was milled too. The works on the pipe had the task to interrupt it before the radiator to put it out service for repair. These borings and lockings of under pressure tubes are called HOT-TAPPING and are executed by specialised companies. By milling of the security enclosure and by these apertures the pressure released from this part of the plant through the pentane columns, air-cooler reflown vessel and the involved piping system. During this action  the hydrocarbons (C1-C5) and H2S escaped, in total a quantity of 14.45 kg. For a  sulphur content of 1.5 ma% in the hydro-cracker unit in the quantity which was gone out 1.385 kg H2S. By the outlet three collaborators of external companies which made the works were injured,  one of them fatally. Immediately after the gas escape the plant was shut down. The application of the plant fire brigade prevented a larger distribution of the gas cloud. The neighbourhood was not in danger.",The testing of the employed bore-machine showed that the cause of the perturbance was the discordance between the actual advance value and the advance value indication. The bore movement was exactly the double the required and displayed. By this the fitting was destroyed. It is presumed that the false indication is a consequence of a construction error which was from the beginning in the bore-machine and was not observed.,By the outlet three collaborators of external companies which made the works have been injured one of them deathly.,Immediately after the gas outburst the plant was shut down. The intervention of the fire brigade prevented a larger spreading of the gas cloud.,Creation of a maintenance instruction for the application of the HOT-TAPPING-methods.

With the activation of the ""evacuation-push-button"" all material transport operations and therefore also the pump which transfers the raw aldehyde (unrefined - not distilled acetaldehyde) in the distillation unit were shut down (closed). Due to the fact that the pipe rupture occurred in flow direction the distillation column was isolated.

During the discharge of liquid chlorine from a road tanker to a storage tank the vent valve on the transfer line was opened allowing liquid chlorine into the main vent. There was flash vapourisation of liquid chlorine and the pressure surge resulted in damages to caustic absorption, bleach and hydrogen chloride columns. The damages and also the failure of liquid loop seals resulted in a leak of gas (mainly chlorine) within the chlorination plant building and in a localized area immediately adjacent to the plant. Some hydrogen chloride may have been emitted for a short time as a result of the failure of the hydrogen chloride column and column loop seals before automatic isolation took place. The leak was isolated and water sprays were used to minimize the effects of residual fumes.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
During unloading, vent valve on transfer line was opened when it should have been closed allowing liquid chlorine into the vent main. Flash vapourisation of liquid chlorine caused the observed damages and emission to atmosphere.

CAUSES:
The accident was caused by the error of an experienced operator (in leaving the vent valve opened during unloading) together with a wrong system design which made it possible to vent with open storage tanks.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 6 people were hospitalized and 2 received first aid due to the toxic release.MATERIAL LOSS:The pressure surge caused by the flash vapourization of liquid chlorine resulted in damages to caustic absorption, bleach and hydrogen chloride columns in the vent system.

The sound operation of this system has been incorporated into a check procedure prior to discharge;3- correctly sized orifice plates to be fitted into the vent lines to prevent the over-pressurization of the absorption columns should the vent valves be wrongly open or opened.When the Original Report was prepared also the following actions were to be evaluated:4- the provision of a liquid gas separator on the vent line (a suggestion from the recommendation contained in draft ""Safety advice for bulk chlorine installations""). The separator is to be fitted with a temperature alarm which could then be connected to an automatic isolation valve;5- the provision of a logic interlock system to automatically control the complete discharge (this system built in fail-safe devices in the event of failure).The company decided to engage Courtaulds Engineering ltd bringing forward their hazard operability study for their ""safety case"" and the whole of the plant had to be thoroughly investigated."

1132,1181,Near Miss,"Power generation, supply and distribution ",Release of hydrogen sulfide from a biogas plant,2019-04-03 17:20:00,2019-04-03 17:20:00,"Only maize silage is used as a substrate in the biogas production plant concerned. No slurry or other co-substrates are used. Experience suggests that no critical H2S concentrations are to be expected in such a biogas production plant.Nevertheless, a dangerous release of hydrogen sulfide occurred.
The causes of the hydrogen sulfide formation are related to the trial operation of a digestate thickening plant operated at the operator’s premises by an equipment supplier in trial mode. The plant had not yet been handed over to the operator. As part of this trial operation, the equipment supplier tried to achieve the agreed process parameters. As this did not work, the operator did not continue the procedure. The plant was shut down by the supplier and subsequently dismantled. The substances produced during the trial and introduced into the existing digestate storage facility remained behind.
An expert concluded that microbial processes could be a possible cause of the hydrogen sulfide formation. From the Baden-Württemberg State Office for the Environment, Land Surveys and Nature Protection’s point of view, hydrogen sulfide could also have been formed as a result of a pH reduction by the sulfuric-acid process chemistry combined with the accumulation of sulfur-containing components in the digestate storage facility.
The supplier of the plant could no longer be involved in the investigation of the event. Operational data on the trial operation, in particular on the composition and quantities of substances produced in the digestate storage containers, were no longer available. There was no longer any technical communication with the plant supplier.
Lean gas, which is used to produce heat in a catalytic afterburner, is stored in the gas storage tank of the digestate storage tank concerned. It is connected to gas analysis apparatus. This showed no noticeable H2S values before the event. The operator had no indication of possible dangers from the stored digestate. Consequently, a hazard analysis, which would have revealed increased hydrogen sulfide formation, was not carried out.
It was planned to spread the digestate on the agricultural land in the surrounding area during the upcoming season. The event occurred at the filling plant.
During the filling of liquid digestate at a filling station, hydrogen sulfide escaped in dangerous concentrations, the driver of the collection wagon lost control, became unconscious and fell from the slurry container.
The driver needs to hold the switch at the top of the container down for the pump to run (dead man’s switch). He was supposed to stand at the top to prevent the container from overflowing.
The accident occurred during a normal filling process. The plant was operational.
Safety measures:Filling process interrupted by dead man’s switch – no further filling planned.","The event is linked to a digestate thickening process. The process equipment in question was no longer in operation at the time of the event. It had been dismantled during the commissioning or testing phase. The processed liquid digestate from this process equipment was stored in the digestate storage facility concerned. There was no documentation of the substances, data and quantities introduced in the course of commissioning.
The significant H2S formation was observed only on digestate that had undergone a separate thickening process. That part of the digestate flow which was not subjected to the thickening process did not show excessive H2S formation. The cause of the H2S formation should therefore be sought in the thickening process.
In the thickening process, the fermented substrate (digestate) is separated in a separator into solid and liquid phases. The solid phase is excluded from the further process and sold as solid fertiliser. In the liquid phase (filtrate), a vacuum distillation system separates the filtrate into thick sludge and ammonia-rich water vapour.To recover the evaporated ammonia, the steam is condensed and sulfuric acid added to the condensate. A diluted ammonium sulfate solution is produced. In a subsequent reverse osmosis, the ammonium sulfate is further concentrated and the filtered water is evaporated.
In the digestate storage facility, only thick sludge from vacuum evaporation was collected. According to expert opinion, the boiling of digestate under vacuum may burst the cell membranes of all the micro-organisms still present in the liquid digestate. As a result, new biological substance is made available in the fermented material. At the same time, the increase in temperature sanitises the material and stops fermentation.If the nitrogen sludge obtained in vacuum evaporation is then transferred to a non-sterile digestate store, the thick sludge is metabolised there by the active anaerobic biotic community still present in the substrate store. This means that biological gas formation activity recurs in the digestate store in material that should already to a large extent have been completely rotted.As the substrate store is only stirred extensively, intensive release of gas by the shearing and cavitation forces occurs during pumping only when filling the container.As the digestive thickening equipment has already been dismantled and, due to a lack of documentation, it is no longer possible to clearly understand which substances and what procedural steps can be decisive in causing the significant formation of hydrogen sulfide, it is not possible to come to a conclusive explanation of the causes.
The out-of-spec formation of hydrogen sulfide is undoubtedly the cause of the personal injury that occurred. The root-cause analysis for the large-scale formation of H2S does not lead to a clear conclusion. The description set out under ‘Causes’ is based on the views of the expert consulted. Other considerations, such as the possibility of a temporary drop in the pH value in the digestate stored, could not be pursued due to insufficiently documented operational data on digestate evaporation.",Two injured persons.,"After the event, the filling station was closed by the supervisory authority. Around 200 m³ of the substrate in question were still stored there. Ways of disposing of it safely were examined.Oxygen (through an air separation plant, 95% purity) was introduced into the pressure chamber of the filling station to continue biological desulfurization. The existing gas was burned off using a special flare. During combustion, the remaining substrate was stirred.The flare was operated until H2S could no longer be measured in the crude gas.
A risk analysis was carried out by an external engineering firm for the filling and unloading of the filling station and an operating instruction was drawn up. A safety distance was set during the filling process, which was monitored metrologically. Filling was carried out with at least two persons. Despite safety precautions, a further accident occurred with one injured person (short-term loss of consciousness) during the third filling process. In the cab of the towing vehicle, H2S gas was drawn into the foot well and entered the driver’s cab through the cab ventilation system, which was running.Escape was not possible as the windows of the driver’s cab were closed. In terms of metrology, only the filling area was initially monitored. When the door was opened, the gas flowed towards the driver and led to a short period of unconsciousness. The other person supervising immediately alerted rescuers.Before it was spread, the remaining substrate was first examined from the point of view of soil compatibility. The analysis showed that from the point of view of soil chemistry, there was no obstacle to it being applied to fields. In agreement with the Agricultural Office, the application was carried out by means of injection technology in remote fields.","The relevant substrate thickening process is no longer used at the site. A different process from another manufacturer is used.Accessible platforms with railings were installed at the filling stations. This avoids the need to climb on the tanker. In addition, a mirror has been installed on the outlet pipe so that the fill level of the tank can be ascertained from the ground.Each tanker must register and then de-register after a specified period of time.Otherwise, an alarm will be triggered in the control room. The alarm is directed to the mobile phone of the members of staff on duty.The entire filling area is under video surveillance.
Findings from the Baden-Württemberg State Office for the Environment:

Risks from hydrogen sulfide formation can also arise under certain conditions in biogas plants using only renewable raw materials and where additional processing facilities, such as digestate thickening plants, are operated.
The operator is responsible for safety throughout the operational area.&nbsp;They must ensure that extensions and additions to the plant originally operated are checked for safety and that dangerous interactions are avoided. To this end, a systematic hazard analysis should be used.
The systematic hazard analysis must also cover trial operation.&nbsp;Defects and deviations from biological and chemical process parameters must be taken into account.
The safety management system must cover changes to the installation and the activities of third parties (e.g. suppliers / plant manufacturers). This includes requirements to document trial operation and regular review and assessment of the documentation.

1133,43,Near Miss,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Operators burnt after wrong manual operation on naphta cracker oven,2005-05-04 20:00:00,2005-05-04 00:00:00,"On Wednesday May 4th around 20.00h, a short but intensive fire took place at the naphtha cracking unit of the Total Refinery Antwerp.Ten ovens are part of the naphtha cracking unit. In these ovens the feed stream naphtha is cracked into smaller molecules. Periodically these ovens need to be decoked to assure an optimal cracking of the molecules. When the accident took place the oven B20 had to be decoked.&nbsp; To start the decoking procedure, the feed to the oven must be closed. Next the oven must be flushed with steam. Afterwards an air flow is sent into the oven to burn the carbon, which is deposed at the inner walls of the cracking tubes, in a controlled manner. Around 19.15h the naphtha feed to the oven B20 was stopped by closing a automatic valve. The 4 control valves (not at the entrance of the oven were also closed. The operator in the control room performed these actions. After performing these remote actions, some manual operations had to take place in the neighbourhood of the ovens.&nbsp;The manual actions that had to be performed were the following ones:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First a manual valve placed just before the automatic valve on the naphtha feed had to be closed. In a report figure, this manual valve is situated left from the automatic valve;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next the naphtha feed line had to be flushed with steam for a short period (called short steam flush). To do so the automatic valve had to be opened manually;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards the drain situated between the manual valve and the automatic valve had to be opened to let the steam escape. By doing so the remaining naphtha in the feed pipe between the manual and automatic valve could be removed;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the remaining naphtha was removed, a blind plate had to be placed under the manual valve, in order to guarantee that during the decoking of the ovens it is impossible to send naphtha to the oven (by mistake).-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally the oven had to be flushed with steam during 30 minutes (called long steam flush).Just before the accident happened the two victims were situated in the neighbourhood of the valves that had to be manipulated. Other operators who were working 30 to 40 m away from that place suddenly heard a thud explosion followed by an intensive fire.Because sprinklers were situated above the valves, a water curtain was available in the immediate surroundings of the valves and monitors were available to the north and south of the place of the fire, the fire was extinguished after a few minutes.After the fire was extinguished it was established that the drain situated right from the automatic valve was opened and the plug, which is usually used to guarantee that no fluid is leaking out of the drain (if the drain valve leaks a little bit), was found on the floor. This drain was another one than the one described in the list of manual actions that had to be performed before the oven could be decoked.","Chronology of the accidentThe two victims, who were still following the training program to become operators, went to the place where the valves should be manipulated before starting the decoking of oven B20. The operator, who had the function of ""oven operator"" in that shift, had the intention to follow them (after he found his helmet).One of the operators in training has opened the drain right from the automatic valve. A lot of naphtha came out of the drain. The amount of naphtha that was released was much more than he expected and much more than the amount that came free the other times he performed this task. The amount of naphtha that came free must have been 300 to 400l, this is the contents of the line between the automatic valve and the inlet of the oven. Once he noticed that a lot of naphtha that was released, he wanted to close the drain valve, but it was already too late. He saw the cloud of naphtha was ignited by the hot walls of the nearby oven. The description of the actions the operator in training performed was in line with the situation in which the installation was found after the fire. The operator in training claimed that he did not perform the actions in another way than he normally did to decoke an oven. Although he was still following the training program to become ""oven operator"" he performed this task already several times (but he did not know how many times).Direct causesOne of the most important causes of this accident is the fact that two operators who were still following the training program to become ""oven operator"" were performing tasks without any supervision.The day the accident happened there were enough operators available in the evening shift to fulfil all necessary functions. In the shift it was decided that the manual tasks before decoking oven B20 should be performed by the two victims. The operators in the shift believed that the two victims had already enough knowledge and experience to perform these actions correctly. One hour before they had to perform these tasks, the operator with the function ""oven operator"" explained to them that they were going to decoke oven B20 and what they had to do. Unfortunately this was not put into a report. The moment the operator in the control room announced that the automatic valve on the naphtha feed was closed, the two victims got the instruction to perform the manual tasks. The operator who had the function of ""oven operator"" had the intention to follow them after he found his helmet. The moment the operator left the building the fire already started.In the shift there was a lot of confidence in the knowledge of the two operators in training. Their training file contained already personal notes with the answer on the question which actions they had to perform for the decoking of an oven. The answer of the second victim was correct, but it described the tasks more generally. The answer of the first victim contained all the details of the manual actions that had to be taken before the oven can be decoked. The operators in training answered that question as a preparation of the examination that they had to pass to become a certified operator to perform the function of ""oven operator"".During the investigation of the accident it was found that the two victims had followed an operator performing the manual tasks before the decoking of an oven several times. The ovens in the naphtha cracking unit are installed by two. Therefore the configuration of the naphtha feed and the corresponding valves of the odd ovens is the mirror image of the configurations of the even ovens. Because the two operators in training assisted the manual actions on several ovens, they where aware of the fact that there are two ""mirror image"" configurations. Although it could be demonstrated that both victims followed the manual tasks several times, it is not recorded how many times they just looked how the ""oven operator"" did it and how many times they did it themselves.Indirect causesAs mentioned above the second victim was convinced that the day of the accident he did not do anything different than what he had learned the past months. If this fact was true, it was possible that an operator gave him the wrong instructions during the training period. It is always possible that in order to save some time someone did not perform the short steam flush correctly, but would open the drain directly to release the naphtha between the manual and automatic valve (2 to 3 l naphtha) before performing the long steam flush. If on the day of the accident the second victim would perform the manual tasks in this way and made a mistake between the drain left and right from the automatic valve, this could explain what went wrong the evening of the accident.To exclude that the performing of the manual tasks before decoking an oven had been instructed in the wrong manner, the records stored in the computer system of the decoking actions during the last few months have been printed out. During the short steam flush the automatic valve must be lifted manually. This action is detected on the computer system. If someone would release the naphtha by opening the drain, without a short steam flush, then the automatic valve is not lifted. This difference can be detected by the computer system. The printed files indicated that the past months the ovens were 60 times decoked. The analysis of the printed files also showed that in more than 90% of the cases, it is absolutely sure that the short steam flush was performed correctly. For the other 10 % it was noticed that in some cases it was sure that the actions were not performed correctly, but for some cases it could not be detected if the actions were performed right of wrong. The data stored in the computer system only gives information about the signals that took more than 30 seconds. The short steam flush mostly takes a few minutes, but is more efficiently not to open the automatic valve during two minutes, but to flush several times during a shorter period (to achieve a pumping effect). This means that if an operator lifts the automatic valve 5 times during 20 seconds, these actions are not stored in the computer system, because each period is less than 30 seconds. In the cases where it was sure that the actions were wrong it appeared that these actions could not be related to one shift or one person. Based on these print outs it can be concluded that the manual actions before decoking an oven are not systematically performed wrongly.","The two victims had very serious burns.&nbsp; The first victim had burns in his face, arms and legs. Almost 60 % of his body was very seriously burned and his life was at risk for several weeks. The second victim, had burns on his face and one of his arms. His situation was not critical.Four months after the accident the second victim could resume his job and the first victim had left the hospital.Affected Area: Affected Area: installation","

1134,665,Major Accident,"Ceramics (bricks, pottery, glass, cement, etc.)",Natural gas explosion and subsequent fires occurred in the tunnel furnace of a brick yard,1995-04-04 00:00:00,1995-04-04 00:00:00,"Description of the circumstances of the major accident: In the tunnel furnace of a brick yard, a natural gas explosion and subsequent fires occurred. The damages to the plant and to buildings are large. The preliminary investigation of the state criminal investigation agency could not identify the cause of the explosion. For this reason an expert agency was engaged. A clear cause could not be identified even through the experts, only a most probable cause could be determined. According to that, the explosion was caused by the release of gas from a ruptured hosepipe or a loose plug-in fitting. Hosepipes and plug-in fittings showed evidence of serious pre-existing damages. It can be assumed that either a porous hosepipe ruptured or that a plug in fitting got loose. As a report of the company proves, in particular the smaller and the older hoses were in a very bad condition. The internal rubber hose was porous and the external wire mesh in part defective. The same applied to the plug in fittings. The internal part of the plug in fittings was very dirty with a fatty grease, which in part was even encrusted (degraded component). This could have allowed a plug in fitting to get loose. The typology of the damages corresponds to the assumed cause of damage. It can be assumed that the explosion did occur in the firing chamber but instead in the intermediate roof (cooling channel). Furthermore, it is likely that the released gas was aspirated through the grid of the air intakes in the roof of the tunnel furnace and from there pulled backwards through the intermediate roof, were it mixed with air and formed thus the explosive mixture. The temperature in the cooling channel was of 127 degrees Celsius, which was not high enough for the ignition of the air/gas mixture. However the mixture could ignite in the range of the metal holders of the suspended roof or also be ignited by air pouring through leaks (cracks) in the suspended roof. The amount of released gas, the amount of the aspirated air and the degree of mixture could not be determined.","technical error, failure of equipment (devices / fittings). Failure probably due to dirt / crusting / grease (failure of supervision).","Large material loss on-site, 3 injuries on-site.",Immediately after the explosion the supply of natural gas was shut down (automatic shut down system). The accident site was closed and secured. Two employees and one member of the response team had to be treated externally.,Regular safety assessment of the plant by the operator and by experts (risk assessment).
1135,563,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Accidental discharge from a flange gasket for overpressure in an inadequately isolated section of crude oil feed pipework,2008-05-07 13:33:00,2008-05-07 16:00:00,"Accidental discharge of a dangerous substance exceeding 5% of the qualifying quantity. See Annex VI, paragraph 1 of the Seveso II Directive and Schedule 7, Part 1, criteria 1(a) of the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999 (as amended).","On 3rd May 2008, during recommissioning of the refinery, the CDU2 feed line was isolated at the production end with a block valve, but not at the feed end. Crude oil was therefore able to flow into the feed line through a non-return valve.&nbsp; Recognising that the line had no thermal expansion relief, the company implemented an ad-hoc system to manually drain oil trapped between the block valve and non-return valve using a high pressure alarm as a prompt to drain off oil.&nbsp; However, with no block valve at the feed end of the pipework, crude oil was able to continue to flow towards the production end each time a quantity of oil was drained off, causing pressure to repeatedly build in the line and requiring frequent draining operations. This system of work was not risk assessed or proceduralised.On 7th May 2008, the informal system of work was not communicated to the day shift technicians. Therefore, when the high pressure alarm and then high high pressure alarm sounded at 09:14 and 09:20 respectively, the panel technician failed to appreciate their significance and no action was taken to drain oil from the line.&nbsp; At 13:33 a 12 inch flange gasket ruptured on the line due to over-pressurisation from thermal expansion.&nbsp; The leak was discovered at approximately 13:40 by a technician. 11.7 cubic metres of extremely flammable crude oil was lost to grade.&nbsp; ","Loss of 11.7 cubic metres of crude oil to grade.


",The suction and discharge valves were closed at the feed end of the line to prevent the leak being fed by storage tanks. The company initiated their own on-site emergency response and clean-up.  The area around the leak was sandbagged and the leaking crude oil recovered by four gully suckers.,The company are developing a formalised safe system of work to manage thermal expansion in crude oil feed lines and also assessing the need for thermal relief on crude oil and other feed lines.
1136,302,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire in a lubricating oil plant started in a heat exchanger,1997-06-19 02:20:00,1997-06-19 05:00:00,"Fire in a lubricating oil plant which started in a heat exchanger. 
The accident was reported to ATRIG, the same day, by phone, luckily there was never the risk that the accident scenario could evolve by involving  other process units of the installation or that it could reach outside the Refinery.wind intensity higher than normal for that period of the year, causing the dispersion of the product originating from the leak (release), towards the interior of the unit.Discussion about occurrence:Durig the shift which started at 22:00 h of the 18/06/97 and which finished at 6:00 h of the 19/06/97, Unit 2000 of the lubricating oil plant was in start-up phase (condition), after having been shut-down for scheduled maintenance work.The accident started (originated) in the heat exchanger E 2007 B, when that unit in which the heat exchanger is integrated was very near to reach normal operating conditions. It was foreseen that at the end of that shift the unit would have reached normal operating conditions.When the accident occurred, at&nbsp; 02:20 h of 19/06/1997,&nbsp; unit 2000 was at the final start-up stage, it remained&nbsp; only to introduce rectification vapour in column T 2002, raise the temperature to normal operating values in furnaces H 2001 and H 2002,&nbsp; the feed (charge) of crude oil was of 90 m3/h (cubic metres an hour), the crude oil exiting from H 2001 had a temperature of 320°C and the residues exiting from H 2002 had approx.the same temperature. Distillation products were collected already in both columns and were to be deviated through slops until information on the quality of the product was obtained.Until the accident everything had been going on normally. Attention must be drawn to the fact, that after the shut-down of the unit and the performance of major maintenance operations it is normal that minor leaks (releases) occur in equipment, the leaks are eliminated by tightening the fastening (fixing) elements. This is the reason why&nbsp; in those circumstances the start-up of the units is performed slower in order to allow the detection of possible (eventual) anomalies (disturbances), avoiding that these present a significant risk.In fact the start up was to be slow, for the reasons indicated above, moreover there had been&nbsp; a certain delay due to a leak which occurred in heat exchanger E 2001, which led to the reduction of the discharge. The introduction of the pipes of the heat exchangers in the respective (corresponding) bodies was made with the help of cradles in order to&nbsp; avoid forcing or deforming the equipment, and thus to damage it.The inspection services made a hydrostatic test on the heat exchanger (at a pressure of 37 kg on the body and 24 kg on the pipes, during one hour) after it had been assembled; according to the results of the acceptance test there had been no need of re-tightening.An operator of&nbsp; Unit 2000 detected the leak (release) which was at the origin of the accident; while he was putting into operation one burner of the furnace H 2002 he saw a very large cloud inside that unit, originating in the upper part (top) of one of the connection joints between the body and the primary chamber (antechamber) of the heat exchanger E 2007B, on the north side. The release assumed the form of a fan and pushed by the wind, which was blowing strongly, it moved towards column T 2005. The detection of the leak (release) occurred between 02:15 h and 02:20 h and was immediately communicated to the control room. At 02:20 the product originating from the leak (release) ignited (took fire) in the area corresponding to the pumps P 2008&nbsp; A and B. The fire expanded rapidly in direction of column T 2005, reaching the base of D 2002.","The fire started in the heat exchanger E 2007 B, when the unit in which it is integrated (part of)  was reaching (very near to reach) normal operation conditions, after that maintenance work had been performed during a scheduled shut-down.
A leak (release) of product occurred through one of the joint seals (gaskets)  linking (connecting)  the body to the primary chamber (antechamber), the released product (ignited) took fire.","Material losses were limited to a small area of one of the two units of the lubricating oil plant,  losses are quantified at approx. 1,1 million Euros including reconstruction and recovery.Affected Area: installation","The Onsite Emergency Plan was activated, the operations were also supported by four voluntary fire brigades of the region.During the extinguishing operations fire hoses, fix monitors (mounted extinguishers), water curtains with sprinklers, and fire-fighting vehicles were used, employing as extinguishing agents foam and powder&nbsp; and water as cooling agent in order to avoid the risk of re-ignition, after having extinguished the fire.Apart from measures directly linked to the extinguishing operations some water curtains were set-up (created, put into place) in order to avoid as far as possible the diffusion (expansion) of the fire.The fire was considered as extinguished at 05:00:00.Emergency measures - Remarks: The shift leader gave the alarm by activating a alarm button, located on road M.The signal ""emergency in the lubricant oil plant"", reached the Security Communication Centre immediately after a phone call which signalled a leak (release) in E 2007 B.Immediately an operator of the security service, which was responsible fo communications, activated the general alarm and communicated, by radio, to all members of the Security Service, that there was an emergency in Unit 2000. After the beginning of the fire the operator at he control panel shut down the furnaces and separated (isolated) the loading (charging) FICVs (2002 A/B and 2002 A/B) of those two furnaces. The control panel operator moved to the Battery Limits of units 2000 and 2100, where he succeeded in shutting (cutting, closing)&nbsp; the crude oil charging valve&nbsp; of the unit. Afterwards he closed (shut, cut) in the Battery Limits the valves of Unit 6100 and of the the slops.An operator of Unit 2000 moved to to the Battery Limits with the goal to close the gas valve and all other valves, in order to isolate the unit.A fix monitor (mounted extinguisher) placed in the room was put into service in order to protect the accumulator D 2004.Approx. 3 or 4 minutes after the fire started, the shift electrician closed down the electric supply in the corresponding substation.Meanwhile all other units of the lubricating oil plant were shut down.When the Communication Control Room received information on ""emergency in Unit 2000"" , the general alarm and the onsite emergency plan were activated.When the emergency response vehicles reached the place, immediately the emergency response co-ordinator (shift leader of the security service) started with the strategic disposition of human and material emergency response resources, integrating in the emergency response team also all the personnel of the unit&nbsp; not needed for emergency process control measures.The collaboration of the voluntary fire-brigade of Matosinhos-Leça was also requested through the direct telephone line, which has been set up between the Communication Control Room and their headquarters. The intervention of the voluntary fire-brigade, which responded to the request for support, was coordinated by the emergency response coordinator and can be summarised essentially in measures for cooling the equipment located in the area involved by the fire with the goal to avoid possible ruptures (failures) due to heat radiation of ( the heat emitted by) the fire.During the extinguishing operations fire hoses, fix monitors (mounted extinguishers), water curtains with sprinklers, and fire-fighting vehicles were used, employing as extinguishing agents foam and powder&nbsp; and water as cooling agent in order to avoid the risk of re-ignition, after having extinguished the fire.Apart from measures directly linked to the extinguishing operations some water curtains were set-up (created, put into place) in order to avoid as far as possible the diffusion (expansion) of the fire.The fire was considered as extinguished at 05:00:00. The cooling operations of the equipment were maintained until the emergency response coordinator ordered to send the signal of the end of the emergency , after having inspected the entire area of the accident.All products, in liquid phase, deriving from the fire fighting measures, were collected by the drainage system for oily waters, and were conducted through it towards the waste water treatment plant of the refinery.",Measures to prevent recurrence: installation of vapour rings in correspondence of the joints of the equipment containing products at high pressure and at temperatures higher than the respective self-ignition point.

The site was decontaminated. The liquids collected were disposed of by a specialist disposal company, as were the contaminated electrolytes. The entire hall was cleaned by a specialist company. The waste was disposed of properly.","The following changes have been made:
- The voltage applied is measured. If the maximum voltage is exceeded, electroplating is discontinued and a rectifier alarm is triggered.- When selectively cleaning the nickel strike electrolyte, the contacts are measured using an IR&nbsp;sensor.- Level monitors have been installed in the electrolytes.- The fire alarm system has been extended so that the hall is now also monitored.- In case of fire, the exhaust fans switch off.- The electrolyte heating units have been equipped with rod temperature limiters which switch the units off if the set temperature is exceeded.
The measures put in place served to prevent greater damage."

Sand for absorbing, sodium hypochlorite for destroying and a perfume (GM-1135) for masking the odour were applied&nbsp; in the area involved in the odorizing spreading. They were able to recover about one third (about 200 kg) of the whole amount of released odorizing agent (the others two third, about 600 kg, were collected in the basin located under the plant). Contacts with the local fire brigade and police were made for distributing information on the accident to the public. The odorizing agent release resulted only in an asphalt impregnation in the area nearby the odorization plant. This kind of accident has been the first in this plant (and in similar ones) managed for a long time by ITALGAS. The gasket rupture was caused by the malfunction of the obturator of the pressure regulator that allowed a gas flow which resulted in an overpressure in the storage vessel containing THT. This resulted in the rupture of the gasket (made in Viton) of the filter in the measuring device placed on the flow line to the pumps. The pressure regulator was installed in November 1988 and was inspected regularly as follows:- visual inspections 3-4 times a week;- functional control during filling of the vessels containing odorizers (average twice a week).","CAUSES:

It has not yet been possible to determine the origin and exact location of the fire. A judicial investigation and an administrative inquiry are still under way to determine, in particular, where the fire started: whether at the Seveso site or at a neighbouring storage company. Two neighbouring industrial sites suffered damage (a waste treatment plant and a warehousing company). A total of 9,511 tonnes of products were burned in the fire (5,253 tonnes of products on the Seveso site and 4,258 tonnes in neighbouring warehouses). A significant plume of smoke outside the site (22 km long and 6 km wide) travelled as far as the Rouen city centre, the north of France and was observed in Belgium and the Netherlands. Local residents experienced a nauseating stench, with some of them reporting throat irritation, a headaches and vomiting. The operator was unable to contain all of the extinguishing water and combustion products, part of which ended up in the River Seine, despite the installation of floating barriers.",The starting point and origin of the fire are not yet known. A judicial investigation and an administrative inquiry are under way.,"There were no deaths or direct injuries. It was not possible to contain all of the extinguishing water on the site. The floating barriers placed in the canal adjacent to the River Seine limited the pollution to a great extent (supernatant surface of approximately 2,000 m&sup2;). A plume of black fumes 22 km long and 6 km wide, led to ash falling at distances of more than 100 km along with strong odours. During the first two days, 237 schools in 12 municipalities downwind of the establishment were closed and there were 254 hospital emergency presentations and 9 hospital admissions linked to the fire, though no-one was seriously injured. Restrictions were imposed on the consumption of agricultural products from 215 municipalities and lifted in full on 18 October.Starting on the morning when the fire broke out, samples (air, ash/deposits) were taken by the fire brigade, the approved observatory for air-quality monitoring and information and private laboratories designated by the State. The samples were supplemented by analyses of the various matrices (air, surface water, supply of drinking water, soil and vegetation, food matrices) to ensure their compatibility with current and medium-term use. The results at this stage do not reveal any contraindications with regard to the uses analysed.","The fire brigade was alerted by a third-party company that noticed flames in the direction of the two sites. The fire grew very quickly. In order to avoid secondary incidents, the Seveso establishment staff, with the help of the fire brigade, removed containers of phosphorus pentasulphide (a flammable product, reacting violently with water, generating hydrogen sulphide and phosphoric acid) to a safe distance. As the situation progressed, large bulk containers stored outdoors started melting and firemen had to deal with the release of liquid fuels. After 2 hours of use, the site’s fire water reservoir (1,860 m³) was empty. It took 5 hours to arrange for water to be pumped directly from the River Seine. The prefect of the department triggered the special intervention plan at around 5.30 a.m. and ordered the confinement of an area within a 500-metre perimeter. The fire, which spread over approximately 3.7 hectares, was brought under control after an intervention of 13 hours.

1145,1117,Near Miss,Production of basic organic chemicals,Release of vinylchloride monomer due to movement of connected railcars,2018-11-23 12:30:00,2018-11-23 13:30:00,"The railcar loading station for vinylchloride monomer (VCM) of the plant consists of eight railcar connections (loading arms). Only four of these can be used at the same time.
The normal loading procedure is to fill eight railcars (first four, then the other four) and afterwards all eight railcars are moved out of the loading area in one movement with a locomotive.
Due to a defect of the plants locomotive, it was temporarily replaced with a rented smaller locomotive, which was unable to pull eight full railcars at once.
The loading station is safeguarded with a derailing device, that is interlocked to ensure it is in place during loading. This should prevent entering the loading station with the locomotive during loading activities. This interlock was bypassed by the operators, so that after the first four railcars were full, these could be moved (with the smaller locomotive), while the other four railcars were being filled.
Due to a miscommunication between the operators on November 23, 2018, the first and last four railcars were not uncoupled from each other, when the locomotive was used to pull away the first four filled railcars. So the locomotive moved the four full railcars and the four remaining railcars that were being filled over a distance of several meters.
As a result, the loading arms of two of the four connected railcars broke, releasing a big cloud of vinylchloride monomer, that was being pumped through the loading arms. The bottom valves on the railcars closed automatically as a result of the railhooks being pulled loose.
The vapour cloud triggered the gas detection in the storage bund next to the loading station, which automatically shut the bottom valves of all VCM storage spheres, preventing the further release of VCM. The time of the release was about 90 seconds, the estimated amount of VCM released is between 1.6 and 2.8 tonnes.","Bypass of interlock on derailing device

Use of water cannons and water curtains by the intervention team","Gas detection should be located strategically around the loading area. The existing gas detection at the storage area managed to stop the leak successfully in a short time. However, the activation of this detection depended on the wind direction, which was in this case favorable.
Emergency shutdown buttons should be available on all escape routes.
The existing railhooks managed to close off the railcars succesfully. It would be better if these railhooks were equipped with detection (for example pneumatically), interlocked to the loading operation.
Safety interlocks (such as the derailing hook) should be constructed in a way that bypassing them is only possible with specialised tools.
Provisions must be taken to allow for easy cooling of railcars with flammable liquified gasses on all sides. It is advisable to implement a fixed water spray system (""deluge"").
Management of change procedures should also include changes of the used equipment and the procedures."

1148,513,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Fire in the pre-heating oven of the gas-oil hydrodesulphuration unit of a refinery,2004-06-26 16:38:00,2004-06-26 00:00:00,"There was a fire in the pre-heating oven of the gas-oil hydrodesulphuration unit for the of the refinery.

The accident is classified at level 4 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Comity of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive (level 3 for the evacuation of 600 persons; level 2 for the quantities of substances released by the accident and level 4 for the resulting costs).
The accident:On 26 June 2004 at 16.38, a fire broke out on oven 42F201. Large flames enveloped the oven (the metal of the convection part became red-hot) and gave off black smoke. The fire does not appear to have been preceded by an explosion, but by a suspicious noise, described by witnesses as a whistling noise (as of a valve) growing more and more intense, and then a ""mechanical"" noise.Staff working on a neighbouring unit quickly released alarm and had already manually activated part of the water curtains by the time the safety teams intervened. The operator then cut off supplies to the unit (load and hydrogen) and started decompression to the flare, which was successful in rapidly reducing the combustion. The structures supporting the oven and subjected to intense heat flow were cooled.The external fire was brought under control in 30 minutes using the onsite emergency response services of the refinery. The external emergency response services dispatched to the scene did not need to intervene. The combustion of the products from the reactor loop (reactor 42R202) continued at a high level of intensity for several hours in the convection chambers of the oven and the flues at the outlet of the latter.The output of the common chimney collecting the emissions to the atmosphere of the HDS units, atmospheric distillation no. 2 (DA2) and extraction of aromatics (hydrogen treatment section no.&nbsp; 2 - HDT2) was seen to produce flames intermittently for several minutes accompanied by a considerable plume of smoke.None of the detectors of ambient H2S on the unit triggered an alarm. In contrast, it is probable that a certain quantity of&nbsp; H2S was released at the flare.Among the pollutants monitored continuously by the detectors in the neighbourhood of the refinery (air quality measurement network of the Lyon conurbation), sulphur dioxide and in particulates suspension are likely to register peaks in cases of incidents of this nature. The concentrations measured showed no significant increase (they remained below the threshold of information and recommendations for sensitive persons).","Inspection plan of the oven:The inspection plan of the oven in force at the time of the accident allows intervals for periodic inspections of 6 years and intervals for periodic requalification of 12 years according to a amendment granted by the DRIRE on 8 November 2001, when setting out regulations applicable to pressurized equipment.With this in view, the inspection department of the refinery drew up the inspection plans of the pressurized equipment of this unit according to the method known as RBI (Risk Based Inspection) in conformity with the professional guidelines of the UFIP (Union Française des Industries Pétrolières) of February 2000, recognized by the administration by DM-T/P no.&nbsp; 31 538 of 20 October 2000.The application of the RBI method is based on a software program used in the Group, named ""RBeye"", which automates the search for types of deterioration as a function of data relating to the fluid and materials of the equipment, pressures and temperature. The oven has been subjected to periodic inspections from the start, with inspections every three years until 1997, and tests every ten years. The last periodic requalification with testing took place in April 2002, and was successful. It had thus been in service subsequently for 27 months at the time of the fire.The HDS unit was inspected at the time of the general shut-down in 2002 (""metal"" shutdown) and was stopped in 2003 for a simple change of catalyst.The non-destructive tests performed since the start have consisted in measurement of thickness by ultrasound and dimensional inspections to check the absence of creep, all conducted on the radiation part, as the inspection department held that this was the most vulnerable. Since 1993, metallographic replica tests have been carried out on the radiation tubes and showed the beginnings of sensitization of the stainless steel (beginnings of corrosion which could lead to modification of the mechanical characteristics), but this was judged acceptable by the inspection department, in the absence of loss of cohesion or microfissures.On the convection part, only measurements of thickness of the peripheral elbows were made (see photo below), no anomaly being recorded. The inspection report of the periodic requalification performed in 2002 shows that, on the convection part, the visual inspection carried out on the lower layer, according to the inspection department, revealed no anomalies. In this connection, the history of the thickness measurements on the radiation tubes and convection elbows since 1993 shows no abnormal reduction of thickness.For obvious design reasons, it is impossible to inspect the interior of the tubes.The periodic requalification was accompanied by a hydraulic test carried out a pressure of 85.5 bars.Before the fire, the HDS had been operating since the previous day in ""domestic heating oil"" mode, a rate of operation considered as moderate. It was fed with a mixture of light distillate from vacuum distillation unit no. 2 and LCO (light gas-oil rich in cyclics) from the catalytic cracker unit. The sulphur content of the load was estimated at 1.16%. It should be noted that before being introduced into oven 42F201, this received an addition of hydrogen contributing to the desulphuration reaction. According to the records, the skin temperature of oven 42F201 was stable in the region of 373°C, the maximum permissible temperature being 392°C (set point).Origin of the fire:The tubes constituting the lower convection layer were found not to have melted, having seemingly been supplied to the end by the load and thus ""cooled"". Among these, one tube found to have burst (a clean break of 500 mm), has since been thought to have been the origin of the fire.Expert examinations performed:Two expert examinations were carried out, one by an external expert, the other by the Group's research centre.Expert examination by the external expert:This was carried out on 2 tubes (the burst tube and a neighbouring tube) on the basis of a geometrical, fractographic and metallurgical analysis of the burst tube and of mechanical tests and analyses by X-ray diffraction.This revealed that the rupture was caused by four types of deterioration, the effects of which had cumulatively led to a reduction of thickness to a point below that at which the tube could withstand operating pressure.These types of deterioration are as follows:- aggression supposedly due to exposure to polythionic acids: these acids form when the sulphurised constituents of the load are in contact with oxygen. This situation cannot occur in normal operation, as the load contains no oxygen. It is encountered during shutdowns or hydraulic tests. To avoid this phenomenon, a passivation operation is performed during the shutdown process (a procedure formalized since 1985). This aggression is thought to be old, as passivation has been performed since 1980. It results in the localized formation of grooves in the inside of the tubes of the oven.- reduction of thickness by oxidation/sulphuration: in the grooves formed by the polythionic acid aggression, the material (austenitic stainless steel) had lost its unoxidizable character, leading to a reduction of thickness by corrosion.- the presence of sigma phase (an intermetallic compound causing very marked fragility of the metal) in a low proportion, which may have facilitated the development and penetration of the intergranular attack.- loss of intergranular cohesion entailing slow creep which, in its turn, generates fissuring in the outer skin of the tubes: this phenomenon could be explained by poor heat exchange, due to a deposit of coke on the inside of the tube. This external deterioration of the tube was not visible to the naked eye.Expert examination by the Group's research centre:This examination conducted on another neighbouring tube revealed none of the characteristic appearance of internal intergranular corrosion found on the burst tube. However, on the outside, loss of cohesion due to creep, and on the inside, the presence of a considerable density of sigma phase were observed. The examination came to the conclusion that there were localized defects..","Human consequences:Two operators were slightly injured during fire extinguishing operations (falls due to irregularities in the paving of the HDS unit hidden in foam).According to the public emergency reponse services, 600 persons were temporarily evacuated from an urban zone of Feyzin (including the swimming pool and the stadium). By way of precaution and in the absence of accurate information from the refinery, the Police Authorities temporarily closed the A7.Material consequences:The detailed assessment of the damage to the pressurized equipment affected by the incident was carried out according to the API 579 method, which consists in determining the temperature levels attained during the fire, the spatial classification of the 6 zones and the definition of a criterion of acceptance or replacement according to the zone concerned. The most significant damage was to the oven:&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total destruction of the convection bundle (melting of the upper convection layers; only the lower layer showed unmelted tubes including a burst tube) (see photo below),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melting and vitrification of the refractory on the convection part (see photo below), o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overheating of the radiation bundle, o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage or deformation of elements of walls and roof structure in convection and radiation,o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage to supporting columns, o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deformation of the bottom section of the flue. The incinerator adjacent to the oven at fault suffered damage to its supporting columns (damage to fire-resistant concrete). According to the operator, this damage is due to aging of the heat insulation. Supporting documentation was requested on this point. Other equipment was damaged by the incident: pipework mainly supplying combustibles and utilities to the oven, electric cables and measurement systems, three water curtain systems on other ovens, certain gas detectors, the loading lines and transfer lines of the oven situated in zone 5, together with all the pipework on the east rack and on the ground were not metallurgically affected by the fire because of their heat-insulation protection, the metal ladder of the oven is twisted, the support wall (concrete) of the flue linking the HDS unit to the chimney common to the HDS, DA2 and HDT2 units was damaged, flames were observed for several minutes at the outlet of the chimney common to units HDS, DA2 and HDT2, leading to the supposition of damage to this structure (the refractory in particular).&nbsp;At the monitoring platform for emissions from this chimney, a temperature peak of at least 500°C (the upper limit of detection) was recorded, the remainder of the recording being unusable due to damage to the sensor. Environmental consequences:A description and assessment of the consequences environmental consequences were carried out with respect to: o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the nature, quantities, composition and toxicity of the atmospheric emissions (H2S, SO2, dust),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the nature and quantities of the waste and polluted water, and the channels of disposal adopted.The data are given in detail in chapter 2.Economic consequences:The economic consequences are estimated at a total sum of about 28 million Euros, in particular:o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 250 000 Euros/day of loss of earnings (the production tool being out of action for 3 months),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 million Euros devoted to the repair of the unit, including 2 million Euros for rebuilding the oven as new.","The DRIRE launched an immediate administrative inquiry on 26 June 2004. Numerous contacts were made and meetings and dialogues organized by the departments in charge of the regulation of pressurized systems and those in charge of environmental questions, both local and regional.With a view to identifying the causes of this accident and taking the steps for restarting the HDS unit without risk, a Prefectoral order prescribing emergency measures, dated 30 June 2004, was communicated to the operator at the instigation of the DRIRE.Analysis of failures and causes:An examination of the chronology of the event (recordings of the alarm, of sensors, movements of valves, etc.), a description of possible advance indications and the list of special operations carried out in the course of the day were presented. Essentially, the following points emerge:- no irregularity in the process parameters before the accident and no warning sign is revealed by the analysis of the operation parameters of the HDS unit,- no malfunction in the automatic control and safety devices (independent systems) was identified.The failures and causes analysis was carried out by a multidisciplinary internal working group. The work session was steered by an expert guaranteeing the correct application of the fault-tree model, and who had not been involved in the management of the accident in question.Plant:- Checks and inspections were carried out on the equipment of the reactor loop downstream from the oven (reactor 42R202, exchangers 42E201 and 42E202A/B) which suffered abrupt decompression when the tube of the oven ruptured, although normal operation provides for the application of a very gradual depressurization procedure. Because of this, the internal cladding coatings (an internal cladding skin applied to the welding seams) or stainless steel double skins could have suffered a phenomenon of adhesion failure (disbonding by the hydrogen). No such anomaly was revealed.- the chimney, which had flames issuing from its top for several minutes, was subjected to thermographic checks, visual inspections of the crown by telescope and verification of verticality. It results that the concrete structure and its internal cladding (refractory brick) are in satisfactory condition and in conformity with construction specifications.- 34 lines were checked: o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pipework in zones 5 and 6, mainly the combustible and utility supplies to the oven, were replaced or eliminated (the new oven changed over to fuel gas only),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the loading and transfer lines of the oven situated in zone 5, together with all the pipework on the eastern rack and on the ground were not metallurgically affected by the fire because of their heat-insulation protection. The remedial work consisted of replacement of the bolting, joints, heat insulation and its protective metal sheeting, and the spring supports, - all the electrical cabling and measurement systems were completely overhauled, with replacement of damaged components,- all the valves and pumps were overhauled,- the water curtain systems of ovens 42F201 and 42F501 were entirely rebuilt, - the gas detectors were overhauled and replaced where necessary.- In view of the extent of the damage to the oven, the decision was taken to rebuild it new together with the associated civil engineering works (concrete support columns, first section of the flue). The reconstruction was almost identical to the original, though the following improvements were incorporated: o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 burners fitted instead of 4, enabling better distribution of the heat flow,o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remote ignition device for the burners included,o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; temperature sensors fitted on the outer skins of the tubes at two levels in the radiation part, and similarly on the lower layer of the convection part, for the purpose of monitoring any abnormal temperature increases that might be caused by build-up of coke in the inside,o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inclusion of supplementary man holes.Inspection plan:The inspection plan of the oven was revised to take into account the initial conclusions drawn from the expert examination, and provides for the following additional checks, made possible by the new design of the equipment: On the convection part:o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; replica tests and radiography of the convection tubes once per cycle, o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the next major shut-down in 2007 (after 25 000 h of operation): measurements of thickness of the tubes of the lower layer and 20 % of the peripheral elbows, geometrical calibration of the tubes (to look for creep), radiography (to look for internal corrosion and the presence of coke),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continuous monitoring of the skin temperature of the tubes.On the radiation part:o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checks of thickness on 20% of the tubes and elbows at each annual shut-down (replacement of the reactor catalyst),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the next major shut-down in 2007: measurements of thickness of the tubes and elbows, geometrical calibration of the tubes (to look for creep), metallographic replica tests on tubes at two different heights (to look for sensitization of the stainless steel),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continuous monitoring of the skin temperature of the tubes at two heights.The inspections and periodic requalifications will be accompanied by verification of the safety accessories and the requalification of a hydraulic test.Passivation procedure:An internal working group was set up to re-examine the passivation procedure and the equipment likely to be concerned.Feedback from experience on other equipment or other units:There are no other desulphuration ovens on the site that could display this type of corrosion.According to the operator, the aggression by polythionic acids could also occur on the catalytic reformer, as also in unit HDT2 (hydrogen treatment) where, as a consequence of the geometrical constraints, passivation is not feasible. The DRIRE has nevertheless asked the operator to conduct more intensive investigations of these units to look for the possible&nbsp; presence of this phenomenon of corrosion.Examination of the accident case histories involving ovens in refineries (ARIA database compiled by BARPI) did not identify any similar accident (June 2005).","The accident is a reminder of the importance of certain problems relating to such aspects as detection, response (Onsite Emergency Response Plan), external communication and the limitations of the inspection plan of the installations.Detection and response:In the absence of fire detection on the HDS unit, staff who were present working on a neighbouring were able to raise the alarm very quickly and activate means of decompression and cooling of the in the next 5 minutes. This favourable circumstance must not be allowed to obscure the crucial importance of rapid detection of such an event, which conditions the time lag before the response of staff and the activation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan. Thus, in view of the reduction in numbers of staff in the immediate proximity of the installations for obvious safety raisons (a programme of construction of new control rooms remote from the units is in progress), the detection of accidental occurrences in the production units (detection of fire, gas, etc.) and the visual and auditory surveillance of the installations must be re-examined, without prejudice to the monitoring of the operating parameters.A study group was set up to clarify the modes of activation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan. The occurrence of 26 June 2004 has indeed raised questions regarding the formal implementation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan.It is also worth asking certain questions regarding the balance between the staff allocated to the production units and those needed for emergency response operations in case of an accident occurring. This aspect takes on particular importance outside working hours.In view of the human consequences of the fire of 26 June 2004, the decision was taken, at the request of the CHSCT, to repair the paving of the HDS unit. It would seem desirable to extend this measure to the whole of the plant.Inspection plan:The rupture of the tube that started the fire was a consequence of certain types of deterioration (coke deposit, attack by polythionic acids), which were not identified when the inspection plan was drawn up with the aid of the RBeye software program used by the Group.Further development of this tool would thus seem necessary so that it includes the modes of deterioration mentioned above and to take the age of the equipment into account in the criticality calculations. Deterioration of the tubes may also become apparent during hydraulic strength tests, provided the equipment is subjected to greater stresses than those occurring in normal service. If the initial strength test applied to the oven newly rebuilt in accordance with the decree of 13 December 1999 is suitable for addressing this concern, steps should be taken to ensure that this condition applies for similar ageing equipment.To verify the relevance of these measures, it might be interesting to make a comparison of the inspection plans for these units currently implemented in French refineries.External communication:During the crisis management operations, the information given by the operator concerning the gravity and the potential consequences of the accident, were considered as to be inadequate by the offsite services (Town Hall, Police, Emergency Response Services, Director of Sports Infrastructures, etc.).The operator, on the other hand, considers that the measures taken by the Authorities where exaggerated with regards to the nature of the occurrence. In terms of communication, a press conference was held by the director of the site on 26 June 2004 , the day of the accident, at 18.30.These diverging evaluations were examined after the event in a debriefing meeting at the Prefecture of the Rhône, which concluded that there was a need: - to improve the organization of crisis management between the Town Hall of Feyzin, the Police Authorities and the refinery,- for the operator, to formalize in his alert procedures the notion of ""events visible from the outside"", comprising a fast, systematic means of informing the Authorities, even in cases where the Onsite Emergency Plan is not activated."

The accident occurred during the plant start-up and was caused by the wrong diversion of chlorine to the main degassing manifold. As one of the two valves installed on the manifold broke, liquid chlorine was admitted to the degassing header.

The substances involved in the accident, according to the information so far retrieved, are primarily bitumen and secondarily heavy distillates of refinery (vacuum distilled, named hot-oil), present in a closed loop and used in the reservoir identified as the accident source, as well as in other equipment as heating fluid; as in Directive 96/82/CE bitumen is not classified as a dangerous substance and therefore removed from its field of application, while the vacuum distillate is classified as dangerous substance for the environment with phrases risk R51/53. The most meaningful damage occurred has been concerning the human health, because of the involvement of some tanker drivers in the fire of the hot oil or due to contact with the 170°C hot bitumen; a spreading of bitumen has also been found in the sea water, whose amount ranges from 6 to 30 m3 according to the estimates of the theoretical spread quantity done by the ARPAM, regional Agency for the environmental protection, through a partially buried ditch present in the area of the Refinery affected by the event.The event occurred on the day September 8th 2004 is therefore qualified as a major accident, having a dangerous substance (hot oil) been involved in quantities above the limits established by the Annex VI and having been damages for the human health following fire or contact with high temperature products with one casualty.","As of today, based on a preliminary analysis performed by the operations management, 2 possible different scenarios have been identified; these must be verified by means of further checks: 1) TK-145 reservoir inner overpressure originated by explosion of mixtures of light flammable substances present in the reservoir. 2) overpressure produced by rapid expansion of water introduced in the reservoir. Both scenarios can be brought back to either instrumental or equipment breakdowns or to human error/action. Particularly it is believed as possible by the operations management the introduction of light mixtures or water through the bitumen overload unloading system of the tankers, used for the reintroduction in the reservoir of an eventual excess of bitumen loaded by the tankers to the platforms. The initiation causes are still under characterization; based on the technical elements so far collected by the firm, the overpressure that has lead to the explosion and the projection of the TK-145 bitumen reservoir may have been triggered by the inlet of water, with consequent rapid phase transition to the 170°C hot temperature of the bitumen reservoir, higher than the boiling temperature, or by the introduction of light compounds with formation of an explosive mixture and blast, originated by the bitumen overload unloading system of the tankers; the validity of such an hypothesis depends upon the results of summarizing all the operations performed in the morning of the accident. "," One casualty and three injured among the drivers of the tankers involved in the fire or invested by the released bitumen; two were hospitalized and only one cured and then dismissed.
Release in sea waters through the Rigatta ditch of a theoretical quantity of bitumen, esteemed by the Authorities of environmental control, equal to 7-34 Tons. Smoke column produced by the fire with effects evaluated to be of low impact by the ARPAM. People - Remarks: Four drivers present in the bitumen loading area had been involved in the event: 1 was run over by the bitumen and pushed inside a containment basin, where the body was recovered 3 hours after the fire had been extinguished. Three more drivers reported different levels of injures due to the contact with the hot bitumen; two had been hospitalized in hospital and one more had been released from hospital after medication. Ecological Harm - Remarks: The bitumen search and collection operations in the seabed are in progress, being performed by the ICRAM (Institute Central scientific and technological Search Applied to the Sea), as well as the performance, made by the health Authorities, of specific analysis on the seaclams destined to human feeding. According to an initial rough estimation, the costs pointed out by the firm are quantified as follows: - structural loss: three millions euros (residual value of the equipment and destroyed structures) - costs for the emergency half a million euros - costs of pollution recovery operations three millions euros - cost for the renovation and modernization plant 31 millions of euros The amount of 25 millions euros must be added to the above mentioned costs; it is related to one year (time foreseen to re-establish bitumen production operations) missed production. Community Disruption: The nearby Ancona-Falconara airport has suffered a temporary limitation of operations related to the dispatch of airfield fire engines of the national fire brigades sent to the refinery to help managing the emergency operations. Affected Area: installation Affected Area: establishment Affected Area: off-site: local ","Internal emergency activation Plan with installation of the Emergency Monitoring Center with classification of the event in category II out of 3 foreseen in the plan of external emergency, that is a situation for which are not assumed harmful effects for the population and the infrastructures located outside of the site perimeter but triggering anyway immediate alarm of the fire brigades station, since the local dedicated resources of the factory could not to be able to face alone the emergency event. Immediate participation of the site fire fighting team with 6 men and 2 fire engines. Subsequently the head quarter of the national fire brigade system sends 2 fire engines first, and after around 30 minutes with 15 vehicles and 35 fire fighters. The external emergency Plan prearranged by the Prefettura has been activated for event classified of II category with: - block of the railway path, since a part of the railroad crosses the establishment; - block of the circulation on the roads surrounding the refinery; - limitation of several operations in the near airport of Falconara, without practical consequences; - interruption of the power supply of the 132 Kv line running along the railroad; - activation of the center of joint advanced coordination; - activation of the procedures of information to the population. The fire has been attacked with water and foam coming from fire brigade equipment VVFs (among which two hydrofoam AIS-tankers of the airport type) and from the fixed networks of the factory, while they devoted the efforts to cool the reservoirs and tankers located near the area affected by the event. After around 2 hours from the beginning of the fire the hotbed was under control and the railway circulation had been reactivated. After around 3 hours complete flames extinguishing had been reached. The operations are concluded with the restoration of the safety conditions of the plant as in the respect of the directives released by the judicial authority, which has set the whole area under sequestration Official action taken - legal action: The judicial trial, still in progress, had started immediately after the incident; the area of the firm involved in the accident is so far still under sequestration. Official action taken - other official action: The CTR (Technical Expert) Marche, tasked of the legal preliminary inquiry of the safety report, right after the event has instructed the operations manager to: - prearrange the detailed technical incident report, including the engineering features about bitumen handling operations in similar firms - revise the safety report - requesting the MATT of a new verification inspection on the SGS - short/medium range adoption of the following preventive/mitigative measures: - loading platform tankers relocation away from the storage area, within the framework of the renovation project of the portion of the plant involved in the accident - verification of the safety conditions of the entire hot oil circuit in the refinery - improving the inside Emergency Plan, with particular reference to the response times of the internal and external personnel located in the factory as well as to the interface and communications between the local rescue and national domestic fire brigade teams Discussion about response: Here below follows the chronological summary of the management of the emergency based on: - recordings and reports of the General Coordinator of the Emergency (CGE) - information collected by the gatehouse personnel on duty - information picked up by the field operational personnel involved in the management of the emergency - printouts of the internal and external recording of the telephone traffic Particularly: ~ 07,25 - alarm message, received by the field, is released from the gatehouse through the emergency telephone system (222) ~ 07.27 - the Emergency Control Room Center (CCE) is opened by the Emergency General Coordinator (CGE). ~ 07.27 - National fire Brigade (VVF) call the Refinery, through a dedicated fixed line, to ask whether an emergency is in progress; the gatehouse responds affirmatively ~ 07.27 - the CGE communicates his installation as the field emergency coordinator (CEC) who answers providing the category of the accident (2°) and reporting there are injured people; the gatehouse alerts the internal medical facility, requesting the operation of the local ambulance operation as well as the national emergency telephone number 118 ~07.28 - the CGE requests the emergency routes to be opened by the gatehouse ~ 07.28 - the CGE requests the gatehouse to activate the foreseen communications in the PEI for a category 2 accident; the gatehouse activates all the calls foreseen, except the National Fire Brigade (VVF), already called.

For safety assurance standard regular controls the area have been arranged by the fire brigade personnel.Seveso II duties - remarks: The essential components of the
outside emergency plan have been examined during the verification
performed by the inspectors on the safety management system (June
2001). The technical information for the implementation of the law
related to the monitoring of the new building operations (industrial
and civil urbanization) have been prearranged by the operational
management and forwarded to the CTR in December 2002 for examination.
The RdS (safety report, ndr) has been revised in June 2004 before the
five years expiration foreseen by law, and is still in the evaluation
phase. In the RdS it has been assumed the hot oil release in the
affected unit and the following fire, but without bitumen involvement
since it is a substance not listed in the attachment I of the Directive
96/82.
As far as point c is concerned, it is not possible to point out a
correlation among the organizational and managerial elements with the
accident since the causes are not been identified yet.
","Immediate lessons:Kept into account that the plant is still as of today empty and inoperative, within the revamping project the following features have been assessed as the most important typologies of operations:- relocation of the tankers loading platforms away from the storage area and relevant equipment- supply of adequate systems of tankers overloading control and consequent discharge of the excess in the reservoirs- removal of the interconnections or possible interferences with water / vapour networks-verification of the safety conditions of the whole hot oil circuit in the refinery- upgrade of the internal Emergency plan, with particular reference to the survey of the accident-related personnel and to the operational procedures of the internal emergency teams prior to the presence of the national fire brigade teamsMeasures to prevent recurrence:- Putting into practice bitumen temperature control systems in the reservoirs with interlock of the bitumen heating and feeding system from the upstream facilities - Putting into practice an interlock system applied to the upstream plants: either in case of loss of vacuum level in the Vacuum-1 plant or low temperatures in the visbreaking plant - Putting into practice an interlock system of the hot-oil line to the serpentines to the bitumen reservoirs for hot oil high temperatures - Putting into practice a hot oil throughput interlock system in case of discrepancies of the values between the leaving and feedback amounts - putting into practice automatic loading tankers systems to avoid or reduce overloads, endowed with weighting devices to predetermined values, overflow sensors, ""present man"" systems and further traffic  control measures of the inlet/outlet tankers with compulsory traffic paths directed by indications and signs, bright panels and red lights - putting into practice a monitoring system for the presence of possible explosive atmospheres inside the bitumen reservoirs- putting into practice managerial and engineering measures to prevent water inlet in the bitumen reservoirs, as elimination of sampling recovery minitanks and excluding the water / steam heat exchanger from the heating device - increase of the refinery personnel in the bitumen handling area - prohibiting the direct unloading of the overloads (excesses) in bitumen reservoirs - putting into practice an ex-unloading tankers smokes and areosol collecting system with treatment - installation of bitumen loading arms with overflow control system - putting into practice multiple stop systems to arrest bitumen loading pumps either in the control room and in the local area - putting into practice a verification system to check the issuing of a reclamation and washing certificate of the tankers - putting into practice dedicated systems and loops being able to handle the different typologies of bitumen - centralization in the control room of the indications of the levels of the bitumen reservoirsResponce - Lessons Learned - measures to mitigate consequences: - positioning the loading devices in areas located away from the reservoirs - installation of frangible joints and anti-explosion doors/windows in the bitumen atmospheric reservoirs"

1159,753,Major Accident,Plastic and rubber manufacture,Gas explosion and fire  at a pilot plant for the production of raw plastic materials,1999-08-31 16:30:00,1999-08-31 00:00:00,"A gas explosion followed by a fire occurred at a pilot plant of a factory producing raw materials of plastics. The accident occurred while two operators were removing a reactor outlet valve which was jammed. The reactor contained propane that was discharged and caught fire. The flames caused severe burns to two maintenance operators. One of them died a few days later.On the day of the accident the reactor in question was shut down because of sudden build up of pressure. This was caused by a clogged outlet valve in the reactor. Two operators had prepared for maintenance work by flushing the reactor with nitrogen gas. When this had been completed twice and the reactor was considered to be free of pressure, it was decided to open the clogged valve. The accident occurred during opening. The reactor contained propane which was then discharged and caught fire. The resulting flames caused severe burns to two nearby operators. One of the operators who was severely injured died as a result and the other was injured.","Following investigation of the accident, several causative factors became apparent as the reason for this accident: 1) Because the product tank was full it caused the clogging of the reactor outlet valve. 2) The two manual valves, opened in the flushing of a gasket of the reactor circulation pump, were left open and thus caused a flow of propane into the reactor. In an emergency shut down situation, the automation of the system closes all propane inlet valves and opens a dump valve which leads to a flare.","One operator died and another was injured due to serious burns. Material losses were mostly burned cables, insulation materials and instrument lockers.Affected Area: installation",The fire was extinguished by the local rescue services. A medical helicopter and an ambulance were called out for the transportation of the injured operators.Official action taken - legal action: None based on the Seveso legislation.Official action taken - other official action: Some prerequisites are required to improve the technical system.,"Measures to prevent recurrence: In order to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, the following recommendations were made by the accident investigation group: 1) The programming of an automation system involving propane inlet valves should be altered so that the valves can not open automatically.2) A level detection alarm should be installed on the product tank. 3) All instructions should be rechecked and any changes should thoroughly be familiar to staff. 4) A check list should be created as a fundamental tool for operators to be followed. With the help of a checklist they can ensure that all the relevant operations in different duties are correctly and sequentially be executed. 5) Valves might be grouped and possibly marked with colours. Therefore process state can be clearly seen as valves would be clearly identified."
1160,609,Major Accident,Production and manufacturing of pulp and paper,Explosion followed by small fires in an paint production plant in which mixing and dilution operations were carried out,1997-12-02 11:25:00,1997-12-02 15:00:00,"An explosion followed by small fires occurred inside a hall (hangar, industrial building) of the establishment, in which mixing and dilution operations were carried out. The explosion occurred while two workers were concluding (finishing) the loading (filling, charging) with nitrocellulose scales of a mixer (dissolver) of 4 m3 containing ethyl acetate. The nitrocellulose was stored in barrels (kegs) and was poured in the hopper of a worm feeder equipped with a shielded (explosion protected) motor. Small fires developed following the ignition of flammable materials (rags, ink tanks, resins, pigments) present in the hall (hangar). The few barrels (kegs) near the mixer which had still to be charged  did not catch fire. The two operators (workers) were injured, but not as seriously as a worker a few metres from the hall (hangar) who was carrying out transport operations of barrels (kegs) with a lift truck (3rd degree burns), he has been hit by the flash. Another worker who was working in a laboratory adjacent to the hall (hangar) when the explosion occurred was seriously injured by a separating wall which fell down due to the pressure wave.
The causes of the accident have not yet been identified, the starting point has also not been determined. Nevertheless it is plausible to assume that the explosion occurred externally of the mixer, due to the fact that the lid of the mixer stayed in its place (original position). The explosion should have had the characteristics of a deflagration. The loading (filling, charging) with nitrocellulose is performed by inserting feed-line (supply line) through a hatch located on the mixer lid. Eye witnesses have stated that they have seen a flash (fire) develop more or less at the same time of (concurrently to) the blast (explosion). The flash (fire) has fully hit the worker on the lift truck, severely burning him. The equipment (appliances) inside the hall (building) do not show evident damages.The explosion occurred when the loading (charging) operation with nitrocellulose&nbsp; was almost terminated (finished).The access to the hall is blocked due to the demolition (collapse) of the structure. As a consequence it has been impossible at the moment to find any element for identifying the causes and the ignition source.The two operators have declared to have followed the standard procedures. Regular training courses are held for the personnel.The witnesses present have moreover declared to have smelled the presence of ethyl acetate vapours, which are recognisable through the intense smell.More or less at the same time as the explosion a violent flash (fire) developed which has hit plainly one operator which was driving a lift truck a few metres outside the hall (hangar).","The accident may have originated from the ignition of vapours probably released from the hatch and accumulated (concentrated) in the corner of the hall due to insufficient internal ventilation. The release may have also occurred through the flanging of the lid. The mixers are ignition shielded with a nitrogen atmosphere with a light over-pressure. Small probes (detectors) inside the mixer connected to an alarm monitor (detect ) the Oxygen (O2) concentration. The alarm is calibrated at 3% oxygen content and another at 0.5 bar (atmospheres). There has been no alarm before the explosion, nor, according to the persons present at that time, has there been any persistent smell due to the presence of ethyl acetate.
The ignition source is unknown.
Both workers charged with the filling operation affirm to have followed standard procedures. One of the workers had been engaged since a few months.","The explosion, with characteristics of a deflagration, has
caused: the partial collapse (break-down) of the perimeter wall of the
establishment, which was located at 1.5 m (1.5 metres from the mixer
and which had a thickness of 25 cm (25 centimetres, 0.25 metres); the
collapse (break down) of three dividing walls in the hall (hangar) of
three bays (spans) of hall (hangar) No. 13; the destruction of a hoist
(elevator) bay having a size of 1.8 x 1.5m, located at the opposite
side of the hall (hangar); rupture (breaking) of all glass windows
(glazing) of the hall (hangar). The mixer in question did not show
serious damages, due to the fact that the explosion occurred most
probably above the mixer. The motor of the feeder was thrown
(projected) at a distance of 2.5 m (metres) from the mixer, whereas the
screw (worm) of the feeder although being damaged, stayed in its place,
and turned over laterally (on a side) due to the pressure wave. Many
windows broke in the buildings of the establishment up to 200 m from
the explosion point. There have been no effects off-site (outside of)
the establishment.People - Remarks: 13 persons were injured of
which 5 not seriously which were dismissed from hospital the next day,
6 of the other 8 received a prognosis between 30 and 60 days, the other
two a reserved prognosis. One of the seriously injured received 3rd
(third) degree burns on 70% of the body whereas the other one suffered
from a head injury, multiple fractures and a liver injury.
There were 20 persons present in the hall when the accident occurred.
It has not been considered necessary to include in the population at
risk the other workers present in the establishment (approx. 250
others), although they may have been exposed to the risk of injury from
the projection of fragments (glass in particular).
There has been no damage to the personnel of the emergency relief teams
nor to persons outside the establishment.Ecological harm - Remarks: The fire extinguishing water was collected in the used water recovery tanks of the establishmentMaterial loss - Remarks: Damage to equipment has still to be evaluated. Relevant damages to the structures of hall No. 13 and to a lot of windows (glazing) of the buildings in the establishment. The economic damages have therefore still to be quantified.Disruption of community life: There has been no interruption of services outside the establishment. The accident has had a resonance at national level due to its gravity (seriously injured workers) as well as due to the singularity of its dynamic.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment","The emergency response action started a few seconds after the&nbsp; explosion. A team of fire fighters composed by 25 elements (men) was immediately activated, and, with the help of a special vehicle equipped with a manually controllable and monitored nozzle and portable fire extinguishers with solid materials (dry powder), has extinguished&nbsp; in a few minutes the small fires which had developed consequent to the explosion. Also the automatic water sprinkler system was immediately activated, with the exception of the installation on the collapsed wall which was destroyed.When the first fire truck of the fire brigade of Cinisello Balsamo reached (after about 15 minutes) the site of the accident all fires had been already extinguished. Afterwards the fire brigade teams from Milan, Monza, Saronno reached the site. The first ones to arrive were 60 policemen. After about an hour a police team with dogs intervened to check the eventual presence of bodies under the collapsed wall (debris).The evacuation plan of the establishment was immediately activated, 267 workers were present at that time.The first ambulance arrived after approx. 25 minutes from the accident and has rescued and transported to the hospital of Cinisello the most seriously injured. Approx. 10 min after the arrival of the first ambulance other 4 ones equipped for burns arrived from Cinisello, Monza, Milan and Saronno.The injured persons had been brought outside the hall (hangar) by the on-site emergency response team before the ambulances arrived, while first aid care was left to the specialised personnel.There was no interruption of services outside of the establishment.Official action taken - legal action: A judicial investigation is under way in order to determine eventual responsibilities regarding the accident.Seveso II duties  - remarks: The establishment is
subject to the general provisions in the field of the control of major
accident hazards, as foreseen by the Italian legislation implementing
the ""Seveso I Directive"" EC/82/501 (Art. 3 D.P.R. 175/88).

Damage amounting to approx. 2,000,000 Euro and one rescue worker injured.Following technical disturbances in a plant component (conductive roll in the coating cell) a fire developed in the corresponding plant part and spread over the entire plant.","The result of the investigation into this fire suggests increased heat production during a technical process was the cause.Wear debris from brushes had abraded on a copper conductor roll and had caused both a build up of frictional heat as well as resistance heat due to the poor electrical contacting. This resulted in a recrystallisation of copper cables between the contact rails and the brushes causing individual strands and entire cables to separate.It is possible that an arc caused the fire to ignite; on the other hand, it is also possible that the heat released was enough to ignite the conductor roll with the deposit build-up itself, or ignite the plastic extraction system which was in the immediate vicinity.The extraction system caused the fire to spread quickly and explosively. This is due to hydrogen which was still in the extraction ducts after the plant had been shut down.",Fire damage,- Emergency shut-down of the plant- Onsite fire brigade alerted- Fire brigade alertedDamage repaired: Burnt down plant / plant components made safe / dismantled&nbsp;,not given

There were no fatalities. Large quantities of black smoke were emitted from the resultant fire which dispersed at a high level over southern England and beyond. The fire burned for 3 days and large quantities of water and foam were used to extinguish the flames. Early indications are that some product, water and foam flowed off site. Remediation work has commenced and work continues to evaluate the long and short term effects on the environment, on ground and drinking water contamination and effects on the health of persons in the vicinity. ","The police and fire service led the emergency response and at the peak of the incident there were 180 firefighters tackling the blaze using 26 fire pumps and over 700,000 litres of foam were used. Until the cause of the explosion is determined and what caused any loss of containment of fuel, it is not possible to make definitive recommendations to ensure and improve safety in the future at this or similar depots. About 2000 people were evacuated. Sections of the M1 motorway were closed.This particular depot will be out of commission for many months. For other similar depots the Competent Authority has issued a Safety Alert to operators and is undertaking a series of inspections to ensure that preventative measures meet current standards.Early indications are that some product, water and foam flowed off site. Remediation work has commenced and work continues to evaluate the long and short term effects on the environment, on ground and drinking water contamination and effects on the health of persons in the vicinity.",The substantial overpressure resulting from the explosion is a matter of concern and resources are being targetted at determining why this was the case. The results of this work will be of significance to the industry and other CAs and will be widely disseminated when known. It will also be relevant to reviewing standards of safety and environmental protection at such sites as well as policy on land use planning matters.

1165,97,Major Accident,"Processing of ferrous metals (foundries, smelting, etc.)",15 April 2016 Fire and substance release at a blast furnace of a smelting works,2016-04-15 21:00:00,2016-04-15 00:00:00,"On 15&nbsp;April&nbsp;2016 at 20.53, a jet fire occurred in a blow mould of a blast furnace. As a result of this incident, approximately 30&nbsp;t of coke were ejected.The resulting fire was swiftly brought under control by the on-site fire service with support from the fire brigade.The blast furnace was quickly put in a safe state. In particular, this involves cutting the blast furnace off from the gas network and bringing the cooling system into operation (emergency diesel). In general, jet fires can have two different causes:Failure of the jet tip’s fireproof material:The hot blast (approx. 1&nbsp;200&nbsp;°C) burns through the jet’s steel casing.In this event, a whistling noise is perceived before material is ejected.Mechanical strain on the blow mould:Formations (iron, burden) inside slide down the furnace wall and can lead to an impact on the blow moulds. This can result in a significant crack occurring at the site of the jet tip in the blow mould, through which a hot blast can escape. In extreme cases, the blow mould can be sucked inside the furnace. In this event, the jet and/or the blow mould spontaneously fails and material is ejected. Effects of the incident:No one was injured. The blast furnace was damaged, particularly in the cable runs and switch units affected by the fire.Furnace gas escaped through the opening in the furnace around the blow mould’s jet and, due to the surrounding conditions (hot gas, red-hot coke, influx of hot air) immediately combusted.The fire caused further visible emissions, largely due to the coke fire and water vapour during firefighting efforts. The smoke cloud drifted towards the river Rhine / Rheinhausen.The water used to extinguish the fire is not thought to have been contaminated with pollutants, as the water was largely used to cool the escaping coke and the parts of the facility.The water ended up on the floor of the smelting works, and from there flowed into the Rhine via the normal drainage system, which is fitted with oil separators.","Based on the water attendant’s description of events (spontaneous incident with no prior whistling noise), it is thought that a jet fire occurred due to mechanical stress on the blow mould caused by formations.",Inside: cables and steel structures; 2 million Euro,Firefighting efforts by the fire service.Blast furnace cut off from the gas network.On-site fire service assisted by the fire brigade.,"It will remain the case that jet fires cannot be definitively ruled out. Nonetheless, measures are currently being tested to further reduce the effects of jet fires (see limitation safeguards). — Exchange of experience with other blast furnace operators.- Assess the ability to retrofit firefighting systems around cable runs."
1166,418,Major Accident,Wholesale and retail storage and distribution (excluding LPG),Domino explosion of 6 tanks due to boil-over and fire-ball of a gasoil  tank ,1987-06-02 13:00:00,1987-06-02 00:00:00,"SAFETY SYSTEMS OR OPERATORS INTERVENTION:Fire alarm by telephone.OTHER SYSTEMS INVOLVED AND OPERATING CONDITIONS:Modification works at the electrical network of the welding posts was carrying out nearby the tanks. This may have had a possible relation with the explosion.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:No wind when the fire occurred.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:During modification works on non-energized electrical cables, at 13:05 a flash fire in the pumping station occurred followed after 1 minute by an explosion in the area. Ten minutes later, at 13:15 the first tank (250 m3 storage capacity for additives) exploded, and fired like a rocket up to about 200m, falling down 60 m away outside the storage area and spreading the fire to about 1/3 of the depot. The explosion of 5 other tanks followed. At 13:18 the local authorities were alarmed by telephone and, at 13:23,&nbsp; a first control center was made up by the fire brigade. At 13:28 the fire brigade (42 men and 4 fire-trucks) arrived on-site and started the procedures to isolate the storage installation; at the same time arrived the first medical service (3 doctors with an ambulance). At 13:40 the traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated. On-site there were 8 doctors, 5 ambulances and 2 re-animation vehicles. 18 beds for injured people were available. At 13:55, 117 policemen were present (200 at 14:20). At 14:10 the cooling of tanks (about 2,000m3/h by means of 25 monitors) was activated (it was carried out until the fire was extinguished). At 14:30, 200 policemen, 150 firemen, 20 doctors and nurses were present on-site. At 14:45, the Particular Emergency Plan was activated and the organization of emergency was under the direct control of the local Prefect. At 17:00 the fire spread all over the depot despite the water cooling. At 17:25 a first attempt to extinguishing the fire was carried out by means of 9 guns using 100,000 litres of foam. At 18:32 the explosion of another tank occurred and 6 firemen were wounded. The fire extended. The medical staff was reinforced. The explosion was due to boil-over of a tank containing 1,000 m3 of gasoil which created a fire-ball nearly 450m high and 200m wide. The fire spread to to the neighbouring storage area and to various buildings inside the installation. At that time, about 72,000 litres of foam were used. During the night 2 floating roof tanks in the near storage area caught fire. At 06:35 of June 3rd, a second attempt to extinguish the fire was carried out by means of 17 guns (2 of which with a large flow) using 200,000 litres of foam. The use of foam monitors with large capacity (6,000 litres/min) had proved really efficient. At 07:30 the fire in the storage area was extinguished. At 09:00 the fire was extinguished using 140,000 litres of foam during the second attempt (there was still a small leak at the bottom of a tank). At 13:48 the fire was completely extinguished. The cooling of the tanks continued for the following two days (4 and 5), using a limited amount of foam as a preventive measure. On June 6th-7th, a small quantity of foam was used, as a preventive measure, during the draining of some tanks. Polluted fire fighting water and unburned hydrocarbons that could be contained (about 10,000 m3 remained in the parks and drains) were collected and transferred by barges and wagons to a petroleum refinery for treatment.","CAUSES:
When the Original Report was prepared, the causes of the accident were still under investigation.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment, 2 people working in the storage installation were killed and 8 (3 slightly) people injured in the fire. 6 firemen were injured by the explosion of a tank. Fire fighting operations required the intervention of more than 150
firemen for about 24 hours. About 200 policemen were employed to
control the road traffic, evacuate the personnel in the industrial area
and transport the foam during the night. 25 people (13 of them were
doctors) give medical help.MATERIAL LOSS:More than ten tanks in the storage area No 1 and 3 were completely destroyed (tanks No 6, 12, 14, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 59.1, 20 and 22) or damaged in such a way to make impossible their use. Also, the loading stations, the office building, some vehicles parked nearby and other components in the storage installation were destroyed. No data are available about the cost of the material damages.ECOLOGICAL HARM:During the fire were released into the environment sulphur dioxide, lead compounds and particulate produced by the combustion of hydrocarbons. The amount of sulphur dioxide and lead compounds had been estimated, respectively, in 12 tonnes and 600 kg. No data are available about the amount of particulate released. In the document attached to the Original Report the observed environmental pollution was not significant. When that document was prepared, the risk of pollution of underground waters due to the infiltration of hydrocarbons in the soil was not yet completely resolved and the control of the water bearing stratum had to carry out.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX.

The first fire brigade (42 men and 4 fire-trucks) arrived on-site and started the procedures to isolate the storage installation. The traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated.The cooling of the tanks was carried out by means of 25 guns employing about 2000 m3/h over 24 hours. The extinguishing of the fire was carried out, during the first attempt, with 9 guns employing 72,000 litres of foam. During the second attempt were used 17 guns and 140,000 litres of foam. After the fire was extinguished, the cooling of the tanks continued for the following two days, using a limited amount of foam as a preventive measure.

The first fire brigade (42 men and 4 fire-trucks) arrived on-site and started the procedures to isolate the storage installation. The traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated. The Particular Emergency Plan was activated. Fire fighting operations required the intervention of more than 150 firemen for about 24 hours. About 200 policemen were employed to control the road traffic, evacuate the personnel in the industrial area and transport the foam during the night. 25 people (13 of them were doctors) give medical help (18 beds for injured people and 11 operating rooms were prepared).Official action taken - other official action: Cleaning of the plant when the authorities will allow it.","MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE ACCIDENT:These measures will be defined when the results of the investigations will be available. In any case, a revision of technical regulations for hydrocarbons storage areas was foreseen. The main conclusions were the following:1- fixed-roof tanks without weak seam for roof-to-shell attachment are very dangerous because in case of overpressure (which may occur during a fire) the collapse will happen at their bottom part (hence, the released product can spread around feeding the fire);2- the application of cooling water is not very effective. Use of foam was very effective;3- need for special suitable foams for polar hydrocarbons storage;4- old regulations for storage installations were not adequate;5- concrete dikes do not guarantee resistance for a sufficiently long period of time in case of fire and, hence, earth bund walls are preferable."

The fire had broken out in a parked tanker truck. The 19&nbsp;t capacity truck held 1.5&nbsp;t of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The fire spread to several other tanker trucks. Firemen arrived on the scene at 7.00 a.m. after being called by third parties. The operator launched its internal emergency plan. The emergency services set up a security perimeter and hosed the fire.
At 7.15 a.m. the LPG tank exploded (BLEVE). At 7.30 a.m. a second tank containing 2.5&nbsp;t of LPG exploded, again a BLEVE. Four firemen standing 40&nbsp;m away were slightly injured by the explosion. Two other empty tanks exploded in the next few moments. The emergency services pulled back for 20 minutes and then began hosing the centre of the fire again. They deployed 10 hoses, including 4 fire monitors. The fire was brought under control at 8.20 a.m. and extinguished at around 10.00 a.m. Degassing, decanting and inerting were carried out on 4 full tanks, of which 3 were leaking and 1 contained propane. The water used to extinguish the fire was collected in the site’s retention pit.","The initial findings of the operator’s investigation suggest that several fires broke out, although it is not yet possible to explain their origin. The vehicles involved had been parked for several days, which rules out the possibility of moving parts overheating.","The area of the explosions was devastated. The accident caused very intense thermal effects over a diameter of 40&nbsp;m (and up to 60&nbsp;m) and mechanical effects with pressure felt up to 400&nbsp;m away (and debris projected up to 1.5&nbsp;km). The second tank with a BLEVE explosion was blown 150&nbsp;m away. One of the 2 empty tanks that exploded was blown 50&nbsp;m away. Tank fragments, some weighing several tonnes, were blown several hundred meters away. The company&rsquo;s offices, situated 200&nbsp;m away, suffered the effects of excess pressure, with windows breaking and equipment being knocked over. Around 20 trucks were destroyed.
The effects of the accident were felt outside the site. A building belonging to a public works firm and situated several dozen metres from where the fire broke out was pierced by pieces of metal and severely damaged by the explosions&rsquo; blast. That company suspended its business activity and 6 people were temporarily laid off. In total, 5 neighbouring&nbsp; companies and 9 houses were damaged.","Firemen arrived on the scene at 7.00 a.m. after being called by third parties. The operator launched its internal emergency plan.

The fire was brought under control at 8.20 a.m. and extinguished around 10.00 a.m.","The prefect issued an emergency order to manage the process of securing the site.
Following the accident, the operator took the following measures:- prevention and detection of intrusion: the height of the site’s perimeter was raised to 2.2&nbsp;m and equipped with an intrusion detection system.&nbsp; Video surveillance and lighting were both improved;- fire detection: the organisation of a system to monitor the outbreak of fires due to the overheating of moving parts was rendered systematic;- limiting the spread of fires: the operator changed how the parking area is laid out so as to ensure that dangerous goods trucks are better spread out;- reducing hazard opportunities: prohibiting the parking of dangerous goods tanks when full and limiting how long partially loaded dangerous goods tanks can park."
1168,853,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) discharged into a vent system caused by  a vent valve left by an operator,1994-07-06 00:00:00,1994-07-06 00:00:00,"Five tonnes of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) were inadvertently discharged into a vent system when a shipping operator left a vent valve open after clearing a vapour lock from a VCM off-loading pump. Approximately 3 tonnes of this were released at the base of the plant vent stack because a mild steel section of vent line had corroded and been temporarily repaired and failed again. The replacement pipe had been ordered but not fitted despite the outstanding working being held in the computerised maintenance system. Design of off-loading and vent system. Material of construction of VC vent line. Management of outstanding maintenance work/temporary repairs. HMIP informed and Enforcement Notice received. HSE informed.
This was an extremely serious loss of containment which could have led to more serious consequences. It occurred because of a number of shortcomings in the plant design, in the procedures used to operate plant and rectify deficiencies, and in the performance of people. The lessons from this incident have been learned by all personnel involved and the actions are being followed up with urgency. Thanks to the alertness and to the actions of the emergency response team the emission of VCM dispersed safely without adverse effect.Unloading of VC from road tankers unusual - no more than twice per year. Leak of steam through control valve for snuffing valve at the top of the vent stack which allowed condensate to run down inside of the stack and accumulate at the bottom. The gases from the main plant vent contained hydrogen chloride resulting in accumulation of acidic solution. Estimated rate of corrosion due to HCL to be about 2 mm per week. Sequence of events:- 13/5- lower section of vent pipe replaced due to corrosion, 18/5 drain valve found to be blocked, 19/5 valve cleared by water jetting, 20/5 next adjacent section of vent pipe replaced due to corrosion, 25/5 pin hole leak in lower section of pipe which had been clipped, 26/5 decided to replace pipe with acid resistant pipe, 27/5 stack draining procedure revised, 27/6 started maintenance shut down.

The product recently produced got in touch with the exposed, one year older lot. As it happens usually in oxidation processes, the appearance of discontinuities in the product could have enhanced the decomposition process.","Five members of the fire fighting service were treated in hospital, but were not seriously affected

1170,423,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Explosion during mauntenance works on a fire fighting system of a benzene  tank  of a petrochemical industry,1989-02-02 09:00:00,1989-02-02 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:On February 2, 1989 maintenance works for installing some flanges on the fire-fighting system of the storage tank were in progress in order to allow an operation test of the foam circuit. The works consisted in cleaning the pipes internal (the presence of small holes was also suspected). The foam pipe had been already cut and, when a worker attempted to light a torch by a briquet, an explosion occurred. The subsequent fire was quickly extinguished by application of suitable foam already available in the establishment. The activities relevant to this maintenance works can be summarized as follows: - 16/12/88: Operations department requested the verification of the fire fighting system. The maintenance department took over the activities and called an external contractor. The extent of works was normally defined by maintenance department without the intervention of operation department. The aim was to repair the network by installing flanges and perform a hydraulic pressure test. Hence the presence of small holes on the fire water pipes can be suspected. These works had to be performed over an empty tank and piping.- 25/01/89: Initiation of maintenance works.- 26/01/89: Interruption of maintenance works according to the instructions of the maintenance department because more urgent works had to be executed in another part of the plant.- 30/01/89: Production department put the storage tank again in operation by filling it up with benzene, believing that maintenance works had been completed.- 02/02/89: Maintenance department ordered maintenance works to be resumed since they had not been informed by the production department that the storage tank had been put in service.

When a worker lighted the torch a fire started at the open foam pipe and through this was transmitted to the storage tank which exploded.","CAUSES:Investigations revealed that maintenance works were in progress though the tank had been filled with benzene and that the glass membrane of the foam chamber was missing, allowing benzene vapours into the foam pipes. The main cause of the accident was the lack of coordination between the maintenance and the production departments because:- no information of production department on the progress of maintenance work;- the maintenance department was not informed by the production department that storage tank had been put again in operation;- the production department signed the work-permit though the tank had been filled with benzene;- the change of service (from styrene to benzene) was not declared according to the procedures and therefore the maintenance department responsible for the execution of these works had not been informed that the tank was filled with benzene;- the glass membrane on the foam chamber was missing;- no nitrogen blanketing was used in storing benzene in a fixed-roof tank.",EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:1 person was killed and 3 injured by the explosion.MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion destroyed the storage tank (it had been lifted for about 1m from the ground and landed on a side) but no data are available about its cost.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment,"INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Protection of the ?? by cooling with water.

1172,712,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides",Accident in a facility for chlorination of a pesticide industry,1990-12-10 17:00:00,1990-12-10 00:00:00,"Plant description:Facility for chlorination used in the production of 0,0-dimethyl-phosphorochloridothioate (MP-2) and 0,0-diethyl-phosphorochloridothioate (EP-2).A new reactor for production of 0,0-dimethyl-phosphorochloridothioate (MP-2) was used for the first time. Similar equipment was already in use for the same production but the new reactor was microprocessor controlled, especially for controlling the chlorine addition rate and the cooling in order to maintain the process conditions (30°C and atmospheric pressure) because the chlorination of 0,0-Dimethyl-phosphorodithiotic acid (MP-1) to MP-2 is exothermic.The reaction took place in extraction naphtha (E-60). By-products were thioperoxy-diphosphoric acid tetramethyl ester (MP-11), hydrogen chloride and sulphur.During commissioning, the temperature controller was blocked while testing the microprocessor and the connection was not re-established before starting operation. The production started at noon and the operators did not paid attention to the temperature that was recorded. Owing to a high chlorine addition rate and no cooling, the temperature rose to be in excess of 120°C about 2 hours after the production started. The solvent (naphta) evaporated and a sudden fast decomposition occurred at 17:55. This resulted in fracture of the rupture disc, in deformation of the reactor lid and in elongation of the bolts of the lid. Flammable gasses were released through the venting system and through the opened reactor lid into process hall. The vapour cloud was ignited when it reached the control room causing an explosion. On the basis of the deformations of the reactor and of the building, Cheminova Agro estimated that the pressure in the reactor reached values of 25-35 bar and that the overpressure in the building reached values of 100-150 mbar. The fire was extinguished by the internal fire brigade assisted by the local fire brigade.","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The temperature in the reactor increased beyond 30°C due to too fast addition of chlorine and lack of cooling. The solvent E-60 evaporated and, when the temperature reached the decomposition value for MP-1, MP-2 and MP-11, a sudden fast decomposition occurred, resulting in deformation, opening of the reactor and then release of flammable gases inside the building and control room. The gases were then ignited and an explosion occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAUSES:Prior to start the production, the temperature sensor was blocked while testing the microprocessor. The connection was not re-established when the computer was used for process control in the production of MP-2. Process temperature was not otherwise supervised by the operators, although the temperature automatically was recorded. Due to the lack of temperature control, a sudden fast decomposition of MP-1, MP-2 and MP-11 occurred, resulting in deformation, opening of the reactor and then release of flammable gases inside the process building and control room. The reactor was equipped with a venting system and a relief pipe provided with a rupture disc but the relief capacity of the system was however insufficient compared to the amount of gases released during the fast decomposition of the substances. The gases were ignited and an explosion occurred. The electrical installations in the control room may have been the source of ignition. Investigations indicate that an explosion took place in the control room and in the opinion of Cheminova initiated the explosion in the process building.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:6 people inside the establishment were injured by the explosion (they were hospitalized but for observation only).

1176,1121,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Small bore vent pipe breaks during scaffolding construction,2018-10-11 00:00:00,2018-10-11 00:00:00,"On the 11th October 2018 the construction of a scaffold was ongoing as preparation for later repairs to the deluge system. Whilst installing the scaffolding floor elements the scaffolder hit a ¾” vent pipe on a cold insulated process line in liquid ethylene service (pressure around 28 bar). The vent pipe broke off, which resulted in a vertical ethylene release near the battery limit of the steamcracker. The scaffolder immediately warned production operators and the on-site fire department. The fire department started fire monitors to dilute the gas cloud whilst production isolated the feed to the leak. The leak was rapidly isolated and depressurized.","Although the ¾” purge in the end ruptured as the result of the impact by the scaffold floor element, this would not have occurred on this small bore pipe (SBP) if it would have been in its original condition. The cold insulated carbon steel SBP was built per specification, but showed very significant external corrosion. Also the ethylene line itself showed significant material thickness losses.
The small bore that failed was constructed in line with the original steamcracker piping specifications. It consisted out of&nbsp; a 3000# ¾” full coupling (FC) THDD and a ¾” nipple SCH160 on a carbon steel &nbsp;3” large bore (LB) pipe. The piping was not painted nor coated.
This insulated ethylene line was operating in a cyclic (line coming from the offspec bullets, feeding offspec C2 back in to the process) and sweating service (cold operation). As a result the SBP classified as a so-called ‘cold finger’, which is the highest priority category for degradation by corrosion under insulation.","ethylene gas cloud : the total quantity released through the 22 mm inner diameter nozzle was ca.&nbsp; 6.4 metric&nbsp; tons; the release rate used in the determination of this figure was validated by dispersion modelling and the observations on odor and portable detectors during the incident; the model as well as the measurements indicate that 50% LEL was not reached at ground level.
In case of ignition a gas cloud explosions was improbable. It probably would have resulted in a flash fire followed by a torch fire.",The fire department started fire monitors to dilute the gas cloud whilst production isolated the feed to the leak. The leak was rapidly isolated and depressurized.,"

1180,842,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Accident in the catalyst regenerator unit of the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) in a petroleum refinery,1992-01-09 17:00:00,1992-01-09 00:00:00,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
The Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) was shut-down because of the failure of the air blowers that provided the oxygen to regenerate the catalyst in the regenerator. It was decided that the shut-down would be an opportunity to conduct some repairs and maintenance and also to monitor the condition of a new equipment configuration that had been recently installed within the regenerator. The catalyst was removed from the base of the generator by a nitrogen assisted steam reduction system until the entry into vessel was possible. The vessel was isolated in preparation (270 blinds had to be inserted before operational procedures allowed entry). The operational procedures that were followed were those that had been successfully used before. Although, it is now realized that they did not take into account the particular set of conditions (that is the large amount of un-regenerated catalyst) in this instance.At approximately 17:30 on Thursday 9, January, fitters started to remove 2 man-way covers on the generator. First a 30"" cover was removed to allow a preliminary visible inspection. No gas tests were made prior to opening as the system was considered to be open to atmosphere because of its flue to the stack. However, the removal of a valve and flow nozzle in the flue duct work may have reduced the draw of the flue on the regenerator and, therefore, contributed to an oxygen deficiency in the regenerator. The first cover was removed without mishap and the fitters proceeded to open a second 60"" man-way which was just being held by 2 bolts and a block and tackle. One bolt was removed when witnesses heard a rumbling noise from inside the regenerator. This was immediately followed by an orange-red flash came out on the left side of the man-way flange engulfing the group of workers on that side. After a few seconds, witnesses heard a seconf loud explosion. It occurred when the pressure wave from the first explosion reached the waste heat boiler (about 30 metres away) connected to the regenerator by a pipework.","INITIATING EVENTS AND CONSEQUENCES:
During the shut-down of the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit, it was decided to make some repairs and maintenance and to monitor the condition of a new equipment configuration that was installed within the catalyst regenerator. To allow the access into the regenerator, two man-ways were removed and this provided an oxygen entry which produced an explosive mixture with the gases from the contaminated catalyst. The flammable mixture was then ignited and a confined explosion occurred.

CAUSES:
The initial failure of the blowers was caused by vibration to the blower turbine due to loose objects contacting the turbine blades. It has been assumed that these objects came from the actual engineering materials of the turbine itself.
The explosion was probably caused by a mixture of hydrogen, light hydrocarbon gases and carbon monoxide. This mixture was either above its auto-ignition temperature during the oxygen entry (when the man-way covers were removed) or was ignited by pyrophoric carbon deposits. The evolution of these gases was stimulated by the action of steam on the un-regenerated catalyst in an poor oxygen atmosphere (this reaction was discovered in subsequent laboratory experiments). This steam was injected immediately after the crash shut-down in an attempt to regenerate the catalyst and keep the catalyst bed fluid. The opening of the man-ways allowed sufficient oxygen enrichment for an explosive mixture in the previously stagnant internal regenerator atmosphere. This stagnation has thought to have occurred because of the new internal plant configuration which prevented the gases rising and escaping from the top flue and also because of the reduced flue draw caused by the removal of a valve and a nozzle in the ducts between the flue and the stack.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment, 24 people were injured by the explosion. Of these, 8 people were detained in the hospital and 2 of whom were transferred to the Burns Unit at the Hospital.MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion caused minor damage around the 60"" man-way but extensive damage to the waste heat boiler. No data are available about the cost of the damages.Affected Area: installation","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The full site was alerted of the emergency. Water monitor sprays were trained onto the regenerator after the explosion. Approximately 70 people were involved in dealing with the accident.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The County Emergency Services were summoned.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- the catalyst will be cooled in future to 400°C before its unloading prior to entry;2- gas composition in the catalyst regenerator will be identified before the removal of the two man-way covers;3- the entry into any equipment of the catalyst circuit will be prohibited if the blower powdered by power recovery train fails and, therefore, the proper purging of the regenerator had not occurred;4- if purging would be necessary, it will be done using large quantities of steam over a long period of time to fluidify the catalyst bed and promote the reactions that cause the accident removing these dangerous by-products. This will also cool the catalyst bed.5- tighter control on personnel around future openings of man-way covers."
1181,1182,Major Accident,Chemical installations ,Release of a raw zinc sulfate solution at a zinc sulfate plant,2019-05-16 21:15:00,2019-05-16 22:45:00,"An employee wanted to clear a blocked pipe between a container and a pump (filter press). He closed the ball valve on the container (holding 15,000&nbsp;litres) and opened the pipe before the pump.
It became apparent that the valve was not completely closed, so when the pipe was unblocked the raw zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) solution was released from the container.
As the valve could no longer be sealed, the employee opened the drain valve of the container and emptied it into the collecting tray.
Safety measures:
A large proportion of the solution was transferred to the collecting tray.
However, part of the solution ran into the raw materials hall via the open pipeline before the pump. Despite the plant’s containment measures, approximately 500 l passed through the western gate into an open space in front of the hall. From there it passed via the plant’s drain system into a six-chamber tank.
All nearby drain inlets were immediately sealed with drain covers. However, one drain inlet was blocked by a pallet.
When this was discovered, the outlet of the six-chamber tank was immediately sealed off from the sewer system (22:45). The possibility cannot be ruled out that waste water contaminated with zinc (Zn) entered into the public sewer network via the six-chamber tank.
The operator’s estimation is approximately 50&nbsp;litres of raw solution.","The cause was a hand valve on the container that was not completely closed.
At the time of the incident, pallets had been placed on the drain inlet outside the raw materials hall (west side). The inlet was therefore not sealed in time. The surrounding drains were all sealed with drain covers.","Cleaning costs approx. EUR&nbsp;5,000.","Binding agent to contain the solution, covering of drains, closure of the valve to the discharge point.
Cleaning of the drains and the six-chamber tank.","The following measures are the result of an expert opinion issued in accordance with Section 29b of the Federal Immission Control Act. They have been approved by the Düsseldorf Regional Government.
Measure 1:The newly installed ball valve must be included in the zinc sulfate installation’s testing plan. Testing must cover at least the functionality of the measurement and control equipment (position feedback) and the leakproofness and mobility of the ball valve (due to interference from sediments).The testing cycle will initially be set at 1 year.
Measure 2:The ball valve position feedback must be shown in the P&amp;I diagram. Until the next revision of the P&amp;I diagram, a redline revision in the master copy will suffice.
Measure 3:The procedural instructions ‘Production and purification of raw zinc sulfate solution’ must be extended to include a passage describing the procedure for purging a blockage in the pipe from the container to the filter press. It should at least describe how to purge the blockage and what to do if a simple purging does not work. Training must be given on what to do in the event of a fault, and evidence of this training must be documented.
Measure 4:The opening of pipelines containing hazardous substances must be described in separate procedural instructions. Training must be given on this, and evidence of this training must be documented.
Measure 5:The operator must demonstrate that, even if the entire contents of the container is discharged, no other substances stored in the wettable area that have material incompatibilities with the raw material solution (e.g. zinc dust, reactive sludges) make their way into the raw material solution. This proof can be provided by a member of staff with comprehensive knowledge of the subject matter (demonstrated by relevant university studies) by 1 October 2019.
Measure 6:The floor in the raw materials hall is not sufficiently resistant to raw material solutions. The area beneath the pump is not currently visible, as the pump operates in an elevated position. As a high-performance forced conveyor, vibrations in this area cannot be ruled out during the pump’s operation. It is therefore necessary to check whether the floor beneath the pump has been damaged by the incident in such a way that it can no longer be guaranteed with sufficient certainty that the pump is mounted securely.
Measure 7:During the incident, some of the raw material solution was able to flow freely through the rear hall gate into the yard. Following the incident, in order to prevent the yard’s asphalt surface from being contaminated by raw material solution from the container again, the operator added a raised edge, in the form of a threshold, to the floor at the rear gate in order to increase the retention volume of the raw materials hall. The threshold is exposed to mechanical loads due to site traffic (forklift trucks). The threshold must undergo regular visual inspection to check for damage. The proposed interval for these inspections is monthly. This inspection must be included in the zinc sulfate installation’s testing plan.
Measure 8:At the time of the incident, pallets bearing sales goods had been placed in the outdoor area behind the raw materials hall. The raw material solution that ran through the gate was able to enter a drain hidden beneath these pallets unnoticed. After the incident, the operator marked out restricted zones in the areas leading to the drains, into which, due to the gradient leading away from the raw materials hall, leaked raw material solution could run in spite of any and all measures taken. Management must check at least weekly that the designated restricted zones are always kept unobstructed. Staff are to be instructed that the restricted zones must be kept unobstructed. This instruction is to be documented.
Measure 9:The plant drainage plan must be revised. The drains running from the inlets in the yard behind the raw materials hall to the six-chamber tank at the SO2 installation must be recorded and shown.

The manufacturer had nevertheless prepared a safety report, which was submitted to the competent Authority at the correct time. This report categorized the process as relatively low risk (the reaction was only mildly exothermic and not very sensitive to small operational variations). The process included the production of difluoronitrobenzene (DFNB) by reacting dichloronitrobenzene (DCNB) with potassium fluoride at a temperature of 165°C and atmospheric pressure. DFNB was purified by centrifuge and distillation and was subsequently hydrogenated to difluoroaniline (DFA), an intermediate for the pharmaceutical industry. DCNB and DFNB were identified as substances which could decompose violently at temperatures above 220°C but no circumstances were foreseen which could result in the temperature of the mixture being raised by such a large amount above the normal operating temperature. A few weeks before the accident, the distillation mixture had been contaminated with water through two leaking valves. It was believed that the water had been removed by distillation. During the heating phase the operators realized that the temperature was rising fast, but could do little to control it. The reactor vented, flames were seen to ignite at the top of the reactor and then an explosion occurred, followed by a serious fire. Tank storage of xylene was ignited at an early stage and prolonged the fire.","CAUSES:The accident occurred as the result of a chain of events. The failure of the two valves and the subsequent gross water contamination were the first critical initiating events. There was an attempt to remove the water using a second distillation on the water/toluene intercut. Failure to remove water may have been due to phase separation of water in the base of the main distillation column. The dimethylacetamide (DMAC) solvent was hydrolized to acetic acid. It was known that DMAC does not easily hydrolyse to acetic acid, but fluoroaromatic compounds acted as catalysts (this catalytic property was not previously known) causing an increased acetic acid production. Acetic acid was accumulate in the DMAC because of the similar boiling points. It is worth noting that the accident occurred when the batch loaded into the reactor was the first one to completely use recycled DMAC following its contamination with water. Laboratory investigations have shown that 2-10% w/w acetic acid in DMAC gives a reproducible rapid exothermic reaction at 140-160°C, producing a high yield of higher weight molecular substances with evolution of gas (CO2). This lower temperature exothermic reaction drove the temperature up to that which initiated the violent decomposition of the nitrobenzene compounds. Metallurgical examinations indicated that the vessel failed at about 20-25 bar and 500°C, conditions far above its design pressure and substantially higher than its test pressure. Cooling through both the external jacket and the open vent to a knock-out pot could not cope with the violent decomposition and prevent the pressure build-up in the reactor.","EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:One operator was on the plant at the time of the explosion. Although he was covered by reactants/products and fell a distance of 6 metres, he suffered nothing worse than a broken leg and was recovered strongly. Unexpectedly, he died 20 days later from post-operative complications. The other 2 plant operators and 3 operators in a nearby control room from an adjacent plant received relatively minor injuries. During the plant demolition, strict controls were used to monitor the workers.MATERIAL LOSS:A large part of the CFA plant was destroyed while nearby plants suffered serious structural damage (missile were thrown uo to 500 metres away). There was little material damage outside the plant complex (broken windows and minor roof damages up to 1.2 km away). The immediate area of the installation was heavily contaminated and slight etching of windscreens and paintwork of a couple of car was caused by hydrogen fluoride precipitation. The plant was subsequently demolished.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The accident broke windows and caused minor roof damages up to 1.2 km away.Ecological harm - Remarks: Though during the fire combustion products were released inair and deposited onto ground, in the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local","INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The plant was evacuated. Fire was initially fought by company fire brigade and then by local authority fire brigade (27 pumps and 128 firefighters were activated).No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). The area of the installation was heavily contaminated by fluoroaromatic compounds and the plant was demolished. During the plant demolition, strict controls (including atmospheric sampling and medical supervision [blood and urine tests]) were used to monitor the demolition workers (codes 7701 and 7702). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).Emergency measures taken Onsite: internal systems: drenching systems (water sprays, monitors, etc.)Emergency measures taken Onsite: external services: external fire-fighting servicesEmergency measures taken Onsite: evacuation: all or mostly by personal transportEmergency measures taken Onsite: other: heath minitoring/epidemiologyEmergency measures taken Onsite: other: environmental monitoring","Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:1- Procedures for assessing the potential for runaway reaction should include guidance on: (a) emphasizing the need for control of the composition of batch process recycles and development of suitable analytical methods; (b) the importance of recognizing potential deviations from standard reaction conditions which might invalidate any presumption that known dangerous conditions could not be achieved;2- the company design parameters for batch reactors should be re-examined to minimize possible pressure build up;3- there should be approved auditing of examination and inspection procedures and the methods of assessment for: (a) mechanical integrity of vessels; (b) control systems;4- future plans for rebuilding this plant are unknown. The future use of DMAC as a Halex solvent is being considered by the company.Measures to mitigate consequences: The area of the installation was heavily contaminated by fluoroaromatic compounds and the plant was demolished. During the plant demolition, strict controls (including atmospheric sampling and medical supervision [blood and urine tests]) were used to monitor the demolition workers.Useful references: The estimated overpressure from the blast damage and their comparison with TNT charges are shown on two tabled attache to the Original Report."
1183,224,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),Unexpected release of hydrogen sulphide gas from a plant for production of ferric chloride from waste pickling solution,1995-05-09 13:45:00,1995-05-09 14:30:00,"Unexpected release of hydrogen sulphide gas occurred at a plant for production of ferric chloride from waste pickling solution. Two workers were manually adding solid phase sodium sulphide to a liquid phase pickling solution. The release occurred because the pH value of the solution was too low and too much sodium sulphide was added. The two workers were killed. The initial concentration of the released gas was at least 1000 ppm.
1999, the initiating event was the addition of solid phase sodium
sulphide to liquid phase spent pickling solutions, which had far too
low a pH value. The intention was to precipitate heavy metals in the
solution. However, the very low pH value induced formation of hydrogen
sulphide gas rather than precipitation of heavy metals.[TEXT 1]
On the afternoon of the 9th of may 1995, there was a release of hydrogen sulphide gas at a plant, which resulted in the death of two process workers. The release occurred at a plant for the production of ferric chloride from waste pickling solutions. The two workers were manually adding solid phase sodium sulphide to a liquid phase pickling solution. The pH value of the pickling solution was much too low and too much sodium sulphide was added. Therefore instead of the expected chemical reaction (precipitation) an unexpected reaction (formation of hydrogen sulphide gas) occurred.

The time of ""major occurrence - finish"" which has been stated is the time when the municipal Rescue Service had concluded that the two process operators were deceased.
Accident Gravity Scale=3
[TEXT 3]
The site is covered by the Seveso I directive because of the use of chlorine.

Meteorological conditions - Remarks: Sunny day, with clear sky and steady wind.Wind speed: 2.60; Wind direction: north; Wind stability: stable; Temperature: 10.00, Precipitation: NoneDiscussions about the occurrence: The human factor and lack of chemical-technical knowledge. Among other things no proper pH check of the spent pickling solutions was carried out. Inadequate management procedures, the work carried out in an improvised manner instead of following established procedures. Inadequate supervision of how the work was actually carried out and a lack of safety culture. The activity of the establishment was not in accordance with the license issued on the basis of the Environmental Protection Act.","The human factor and lack of chemical-technical knowledge. Among other things no proper pH check of the spent pickling solution was carried out. Inadequate management procedures, the work carried out in an improvised manner instead of following working procedures. Inadequate supervision of how the work was actually carried out and a lack of safety culture. The activity of the establishment was not in accordance with the license issued on the basis of the Environmental Protection Act.No proper pH value check was made of the spent pickling solutions, in the reaction vessels, into which sodium sulphide was added. Various inappropriate, temporary arrangements were used in order to facilitate the adding of sodium sulphide. Therefore the roof covering directly above the reaction vessels was removed and a temporary ladder arrangement was in place in order to facilitate human access to the top of the reaction vessels.","The two process workers were immediately killed due to the inhalation of hydrogen sulphide gas. The accident and associated negative effects stem from inadequate management procedures which made it possible for staff to conduct work in an improvised manner characterized by many inappropriate temporary arrangements, and insufficient checking of parameters (especially solution pH) of vital importance.Area concerned - Remarks: The evolved hydrogen sulphide gas dissipated in the atmosphere to a non dangerous concentration within a few minutes.People - Remarks:The person who went to look for the process operators that did not come down from the grating at the top of the reactor vessels, was himself potentially at risk, since he did not know about the evolved hydrogen sulphide gas.Material Loss - Remarks:Costs: 20,000 Euros (Off site losses due to rescue activities and social costs associated with the two deceased process operators.)Community Disruption - Remarks:Significant media interest was reported. To some extent this media interest disturbed the psychological counselling of the co-workers of the deceased process operators. The Swedish Board of Accident Investigation pointed out that in this type of situation a responsible person should be appointed to deal with the media.Affected Area: installation","The municipal rescue service arrived on scene about 15-20 minutes after the incident efforts were made to revive the two process workers but to no avail. The clothes of the two process operators were cut open and removed from their bodies since their clothes were to some extent suspected of serving as a poisonous gas trap. The two process operators were rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital where doctors concluded that the two operators had deceased. Storage of the bodies at the hospital caused some problems because they&nbsp; emitted large amounts of H2S.Emergency measures - Remarks:From the factory the national emergency alarm centre was phoned as soon as the accident had been detected. The emergency centre sent out the local Rescue Service, a staffed ambulance, and notified the local hospital via telefax.Official action taken - legal action: The court fined the company 70,000 Euros for breaking The Occupational Safety and Health  Act. They also fined the Director 1300 Euros and gave him a conditional sentence.Official action taken - other official action: Investigation reports from the Swedish Board of Accident Investigation and the Swedish National Labour Inspectorate have been prepared. The latter contains photographs from the scene.Discussion about response: From the factory the national emergency alarm centre was phoned as soon as the accident had been detected. The emergency centre sent out the local Rescue Service, a staffed ambulance, and notified the local hospital via telefax.","Immediate lessons learned  - Description: Spent pickling
solutions to which sodium sulphide is to be added (for precipitation of
heavy metals) must be properly pH checked prior to addition of sodium
sulphide. The pH value must be at least 4.5. It is of paramount
importance that firm, well planned working procedures are adhered to in
this type of industry. Improvised procedures introduce great risk.Measures to prevent recurrence: Improved management routines and improved safety training of the staff were found to be necessary. A review is also necessary in order to check if there are more critical parameters which should be analysed on a routine basis in order to ensure safety and minimize risks. The entire staff at the process factory in question need to change their attitude in a direction which caters for more consideration of safety and risk related aspects. The accident also highlights the difficulties of assessing staff education, general knowledge and experience in safety matters for the authorities.Measures to mitigate consequences: Psychological counselling of co-workers and relatives of the deceased took place soon after the accident had occurred."
1184,914,Other Event,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,Accident on 11 April 2011 in the DEA3 amine regeneration unit of the distillation and desulphurization area at the SARAS refinery,2011-04-11 19:10:00,2011-04-11 19:30:00,"The accident occurred while the DEA3 unit at the refinery was closed for maintenance works, between approximately 19:10 and 19:30 on 11 April 2011, presumably following inadequate H2S decontamination in the D3-T1 amine regenerator. Two workers from a contracting company were injured in the accident, one of whom later died in hospital. Both workers were thought to have been injured by the release of H2S from an open manhole in the D3-T1 tower. Both the injured parties were employed by a contracting company involved in the maintenance work on the tower. The work in progress involved opening the manhole in the D3-T1 tower to allow ventilation inside. The tower was emptied, depressurised and isolated by placing blanking plates on all connections. After opening the door of the tower's central manhole, the two workers came into contact with vapours inside the tower, which presumably contained H2S following inadequate decontamination of the tower. The accident presumably released a small amount of H2S gas into the atmosphere; it did not cause a fire or an explosion, and did not involve transport.","Inadequate H2S decontamination of the D3-T1 amine regenerator in the DEA3 unit, caused by failure to isolate the unit due to failure to insert the blanking plate at the battery limit on the acid feed into the sulphur plant.","The incident harmed employees of a contracting company operating inside the plant. Specifically, one worker died and another worker temporarily lost consciousness.","The refinery's emergency team responded and administered first aid to the two injured workers. The workers were rescued alive and entrusted to the care of medical staff from the Italian national health service, who took them to the local hospital in Cagliari. At the same time, the emergency services were called (fire brigade, ambulance and police).","Improvements: in compliance with the directions of the CTR [Regional Technical Committee]: rewording of the Operating Instructions IO API DEA3 005 (DEA3 closure) to make them mandatory; verification of the terminology used in other operating instructions concerning maintenance work. Disciplinary action: pursuant to Article 3 of Legislative Decree No 81/2008 (consolidated text on safety), the disciplinary procedure required under the regulations and referred to in the management and control model adopted by the company has been implemented. Disciplinary sanctions have therefore been applied to the operating and maintenance staff involved in the decontamination procedures, and to the plant managers and security staff, for actions that contravened the Operating Instructions and the plant's procedures (one person was dismissed and four were suspended)."

1189,1310,Other Event,Production of basic organic chemicals,Fire at powder detergent filling plant,2020-07-05 00:00:00,2020-07-06 00:00:00,"At 1.15 on Sunday, a fire broke out in the powder detergent filling plant on the south side of the first floor. While the public fire department was operating on the scene, an explosion occurred at 2.07. Following the explosion, the fire spread to a warehouse on the north side of the first floor, used to store raw materials for the production of detergents. Around 4.00 the fire on the north side of the first floor was suppressed, but the north side of the second floor, where household melamine sponge products are stored, was on fire. At 9.47 the fire on the north side of the second floor was suppressed, however at 14.30, the south side of the second floor was on fire. Emergency responders managed to control the fire completely at 7.15 Monday morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;","The fire in the south side of the first floor (powder detergent filling plant) was initiated either due to electrical or chemical factors. According to the investigation, the moisture content of sodium percarbonate and the plant's temperature would not allow for an exothermic decomposition thus, the chemical factor is excluded.
The fire spread to the north side of the first floor due to an explosion and after approximately 7 hours the fire spread to the north side of the second flour through gaps in the walls around the ceiling. The fire was then spread over a 7-hour period to the south side of the second floor by heat conduction through the wall and fire shutters.","There were four fatalities, including one police officer and three firefighters. Also, four people were injured, one moderately and three slightly. The warehouse was completely destroyed. Roads of about 100m adjacent to the factory were restricted. Resin and soot were scattered in the direction of about 20 m.",The fire alarm was activated on the south side and the security company called the emergency services. Firefighting lasted over 24 hours.,"Overall, the investigation showed a lack of in-depth knowledge and understanding of risks surrounding the handling and storage of sodium percarbonate as well as insufficient safety management and emergency preparedness practices. Sodium percarbonate is a strong oxidizer that may cause fire and explosion as well as intensify fire. Safety management, including training and awareness on safe handling and storage of sodium percarbonate, acceptance of incoming raw material, firefighting components and fireproofing are highlighted. The following measures are suggested:
Strengthen the safety management system

Enhance training on prevention and preparedness
Promote safe handling of substances, manufacturing processes and storage methods
Improve risk assessment on raw materials, composition (mixture), processes and equipment
Implement standards for installation and management of electrical infrastructure and equipment inside factories and warehouses
Compliance with the Fire Service Act and thorough implementation of disaster prevention measures for factories and warehouses
Ensure safety throughout operations including risk assessment in planning and development of processes as well as selection of materials, processing methods, transportation and storage
Enhance auditing and selection of suppliers to avoid importing non-compliant raw materials through an efficient&nbsp; safety management system by implementing a process for inspection and thorough material acceptance inspection
Set up inspections to control whether the processing or handling of materials is not according to their specifications

Ensure thorough shipping inspection of incoming materials
Improve safety controls and structural design, including firefighting infrastructure, temperature/humidity monitoring, as well as structural components and fireproofing
Promotion of safety activities

Join the Japan Chemical Industry Association to collect information on various safety activities
