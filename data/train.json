        "Accident Title": "Release of oxygen and consequent fire in a air separation plant",
        "Start Date": "2001-12-31 16:55:00",
        "Finish Date": "2001-12-31 18:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Release of oxygen and consequent fire in a air separation plantInitiating event/ accident dynamics: on the installation premises a release of oxygen occurred.On 31.12.2001 the oxygen flow had been redirected for a certain period of time to the cooling tower over a by-pass line. On 31.12.2001 the oxygen flow was again switched from the by-pass line to the product pipe with the aim of directing the oxygen into the storage tank. Before starting oxygen storage operations the product pipe had to be cleaned, due to the fact that the product pipe had not been used for a certain period of time and that contamination could not be excluded. The cleaning operation was performed by flushing the pipe with the product (oxygen). Due to the fact that the valve did not close correctly, oxygen was released over the pipe into the gravel bed near the tank and into the atmosphere instead of flowing into the oxygen storage tank.Switching from the by-pass line to the product pipe was made over a remote control from the control room of the other air separation unit. The monitoring system showed the opening of the flush valve and the closing of the valve after 2,5 min. In reality the flush valve was not closed. Oxygen spread over the site and it has to be assumed that it reached also the administration building at a distance of approximately 50 metres.At 16:55 h a fire broke out inside the building and an employee was killed.The fire destroyed most rooms on the ground floor and on the first floor of the building.The fire detectors responded in rapid sequence, it has therefore to be assumed that the fire spread very rapidly. The fire brigade brought the fire rapidly under control and extinguished it.A collaborator was inside the building when the fire broke out because one of the plant operators had requested him to check directly on-site the alarm signal released by an analysing device. The analyser indicated an oxygen content in the nitrogen cooling circuit near to the threshold value of 0,3 ppm. A defect in the analyser was suspected.The collaborator instructed to check the analysis came into the installation at 16:00 and controlled the corresponding analysis. He contacted the control room communicating that no errors could be found and his intention to leave the installation.Shortly after the fire detectors responded.The oxygen content measurement in the nitrogen cooling circuit of the air separator is an essential control parameter for the cooling process. The values measured do not give any clue with regards to the oxygen content of the ambient air in the surroundings.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The oxygen, nitrogen and argon gases produced in the plant are\ntransferred at cryogenic temperatures to the storage tanks. The gases\nare stored there until delivery.\nAir separation is a continuous process (rectification), the\nrectification process always produces the above mentioned gases. It is\nnot possible to stop the production of one of these gases when the\nplant is operating. The plant was running on oxygen-production, when\nthe accident occurred.Known causes: According to present knowledge the oxygen release was caused by the flush valve which was not closed correctly. For the time being it has to be assumed that the flush valve remained open for approximately 8 hours and that during that period of time oxygen was released in the environment instead of flowing into the storage tank. \nProbably the pneumatic valve, which was opened by compressed air, did not close correctly because the relief pipe for the expansion of the compressed air was iced up, due to atmospheric conditions and did not allow the compressed air to expand.\nThe display on the control monitor indicated erroneously that the valve was closed not allowing the personnel to identify the failure.\nInvestigation showed that the valve was not equipped with an end point control device. The display on the monitor was not given by the real position of the flush valve, but by the set flush time. The display on the valve position changes from \"open\" to \"closed\" after a set flushing time has lapsed. The real position of the flush valve was not monitored. With the existing monitoring system it was not possible to detect that the valve was not correctly closed.\nThe icing of the compressed air relief pipe of the flush valve was probably due to an insufficient sizing of the pipe cross-section. Humidity could not be sufficiently discharged, adhering water droplets did not dissolve due to cohesion phenomena.  The compressed air could not expand due to the icing of the relief pipe and the flush valve did not close correctly.\nThe main accident cause  was the control system set-up.\nCause classification: atmospheric conditions (icing of the relief pipe), incomplete control of the flush valve position.\n\n",
        "Consequences": "On-site material loss\n- building damaged by fire\n- damage to the sewage water system, the drainage system as well as to the lid of a sewage collector.\n",
        "Emergency response": "Safety functions: Alerting of the fire fighting serviceProtection measures:Fire fighting operations with respiratorsRepaired damage:Repair of the building, dismantling of damaged and/or destroyed equipment.Protection measures by external emergency response services.Use of respirators during extinguishing operations.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:- Installation of a end point monitoring device on the flush valve. This allows monitoring of the real position of the valve, which is displayed on the control monitor.- Modification of the compressed air relief pipe for the flush valve control. The opening of the relief pipe was modified in such a way that icing cannot occur any more and that the compressed air can be released completely after the closing command has been given, allowing the valve to close correctly.Measures to mitigate consequences:- Setting up a monitoring system of the on-site ambient air oxygen content. The oxygen content is to be monitored both in the open air and inside the buildings. Alarm is released by the monitoring system if values surpass or drop below given thresholds. The alarm will be visually displayed on the control monitor and acoustically signalled.Collaborators present on the site in open spaces and lorry drivers who are on the site will also be warned over the alarm-system, in such way as to be informed when thresholds are not met.A display is to be installed at the entry gate of the site, in such a way as to inform lorry drivers accessing&nbsp; the site. Training in emergency measures in case of alarm by the monitoring system (O2 concentrations)&nbsp; is planned for the employees.Install a wind speed measuring device in the storage tank area."

        "Accident Description": "Removal of a pallet of ethylenediamine (EDA) in metal drums, during which a metal drum was damaged by a forklift truck. This resulted in EDA leaking onto a \u2018WHG surface\u2019 (a surface compliant with the requirements of the Federal Water Act [Wasserhaushaltsgesetz \u2013 WHG]) and forming a localised pool of liquid. Vapour clouds then formed due to the immediate reaction of the hygroscopic EDA vapours with the high levels of humidity in the air. This triggered the automatic fire detection system (smoke detector) and activated a water curtain on the southern wall of the building. The water from the water curtain precipitated the vapours and diluted the leaked EDA (high water solubility).\nSome of the water from the water spraying system, which was slightly contaminated with ethylenediamine (&lt; 0.1%), flowed over the containment system and passed onto unsurfaced ground.\nSafety measures:The fire detection system operated correctly, as did the water curtain; the watertight barrier (shutting off access to the collection area) was closed at the gate, as was the valve in the sewer system; the water curtain was used for a period of time to precipitate the last of the vapours; the water supply was then turned off.The contaminated run-off water was not fully contained, flowing over the safety barrier / containment system in one area.",

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nAt 08:00 four people started to work in the storage installation and, at 08:30, everything was normal. Some smoke was noticed by the storage personnel at about 09:15 am. The first reaction of the personnel was to use, unsuccessfully, portable fire extinguishers until the fire brigade intervened even if visible fire was never noticed. At 09:43 a 3 vehicle team arrived on-site and, after assessment of the situation, immediately requested a reinforcement with foam equipments. Fire fighting operations proceeded with difficulty owing to the jellow/red smoke cloud which had developped. The first attempt of the firemen was to isolate the ammonium nitrate in compartment No 5 from the compartment involved in the fire by means of water curtains. At 10:30 the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident and at 11:15 preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started (shelter information to the public by vehicles with loudspeakers, telephone calls to town halls and through TV and local radio stations). At the same time, the number of fire fighting equipments was increased involving all the nearby safety centres and continuous monitoring of cloud movements by means of a helicopter and metereological indications given by the Nantes station were carried out (the concentrations of main pollutants [nitric acid, nitrogen oxides and ammonia] inside and outside the storehouse and at nearby communities as a function of time are available in the Original Report and the in relevant presentation in the Seminar on \"The Notification of Major Accidents\" held at Rethymnon Greece on October 6/7 in 1988). The toxic cloud reached an height of about 250m and was 5km large and it was covering a surface of about 15 km. At 11:30 the rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. At 13:00 nitric acid concentrations of 5ppm were measured by the Nantes cell up to Coueron. The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. At 13:50 a request to the army for assistance with vehicles was made. At 14:00 the Mobile Chemical Action Cell of Angers was asked for help and for a reserve of isolating respirators. At 14:15 the ORSEC plan was activated and at 14:30 the decision to evacuate was made. Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers. Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people. During this period of time the products on fire were soaked with a total flow of 700m3/h. The fire was almost extinguished at 14:15 but emission of smoke was reduced considerably at 16:00 while reinforcement from other departments continued to arrive. At 17:20 the Prefect gave a Press Conference and at 18:00 a survey on the percentage evacuation achieved was undertaken. The rail traffic was resumed at 19:00 and population allowed to return home at 22:00. At 02:34 firemen penetrated inside the store and at 05:00 the fire was considered as extinguished. The ORSEC emergency plan terminated at 07:00.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nWhen the Original Report was prepared the causes of the accident have not fully identified but it is supposed that it occurred as a combination of the following elements:\na) storage of a fertilizer compound which decomposed (this phenomenon is called self-substaining decomposition) due to a too high temperature and an excessive concentration of organic material (wheat saw dust) due to previous transportation;\nb) no monitoring by means of thermometric probes of the development of high temperature in the heap during storage was foreseen;\nc) the presence in the fertilizers heap of defective (due to poor insulation) power cables. These defective cables (due to their age and the oversizing of the fuses and circuit breakers) caused the fertilizers decomposition; the short duration in which electrical current flew should be pointed out (switch-on at about 09:00 and detection of smoke and switch-off at about 09:15). On the other hand, the short-circuit assumption must be discarded because people worked until they were switched off and, besides, no blown fuse was found and the heat generated by a short-circuit is generally insufficient to initiate decomposition;\nd) wooden pallets in contact with the fertilizers compounds which caught fire during decomposition and released heat which accelerated the decomposition;\ne) the absence of any efficient fire-fighting means. If there had been a massive quantity of water rapidly available to put out the fire, the decomposition could have been slowed down before to develop out of control.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Internal to the establishment, 29 people were injured by the accident (25 by the toxic release and 4 by the fire).MATERIAL LOSS:The storage installation was damaged by the fire but no data are available about the cost of the material damages.ECOLOGICAL HARM:During the main fire fighting attempt, products on fire were drenched under a water flow rate of 700m3/h.

        "Accident Description": "On the 11th October 2018 the construction of a scaffold was ongoing as preparation for later repairs to the deluge system. Whilst installing the scaffolding floor elements the scaffolder hit a \u00be\u201d vent pipe on a cold insulated process line in liquid ethylene service (pressure around 28 bar). The vent pipe broke off, which resulted in a vertical ethylene release near the battery limit of the steamcracker. The scaffolder immediately warned production operators and the on-site fire department. The fire department started fire monitors to dilute the gas cloud whilst production isolated the feed to the leak. The leak was rapidly isolated and depressurized.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Although the \u00be\u201d purge in the end ruptured as the result of the impact by the scaffold floor element, this would not have occurred on this small bore pipe (SBP) if it would have been in its original condition. The cold insulated carbon steel SBP was built per specification, but showed very significant external corrosion. Also the ethylene line itself showed significant material thickness losses.\nThe small bore that failed was constructed in line with the original steamcracker piping specifications. It consisted out of&nbsp; a 3000# \u00be\u201d full coupling (FC) THDD and a \u00be\u201d nipple SCH160 on a carbon steel &nbsp;3\u201d large bore (LB) pipe. The piping was not painted nor coated.\nThis insulated ethylene line was operating in a cyclic (line coming from the offspec bullets, feeding offspec C2 back in to the process) and sweating service (cold operation). As a result the SBP classified as a so-called \u2018cold finger\u2019, which is the highest priority category for degradation by corrosion under insulation.",
        "Consequences": "ethylene gas cloud : the total quantity released through the 22 mm inner diameter nozzle was ca.&nbsp; 6.4 metric&nbsp; tons; the release rate used in the determination of this figure was validated by dispersion modelling and the observations on odor and portable detectors during the incident; the model as well as the measurements indicate that 50% LEL was not reached at ground level.\nIn case of ignition a gas cloud explosions was improbable. It probably would have resulted in a flash fire followed by a torch fire.",

        "Accident Description": "At around 8.00 p.m., alarms went off in the control room of the sulphur fungicide production unit of a plant protection product factory classified as a Seveso high-tier establishment. The alarms pointed to an explosion in the filter recovering dust from the unit\u2019s ventilation network and the opening of that dust filter\u2019s explosion vents. A fire then broke out in the filter.\nThe internal emergency plan was launched. The fire was brought under the control by the internal fire team and the fire brigade.\nThere was significant material damage and the unit was shut down for three months.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Because of very adverse weather conditions (thunderstorm, high winds), the installation had been shut down at 7.50 p.m. \u2013 i.e. a few minutes before the accident \u2013 in line with the procedure in force.\nThe explosion detection system indicated that two events had taken place 2 seconds apart:\n\na small explosion in the vicinity of the cyclones used to treat the air from the spray drying tower;\nthen an explosion, followed by a fire, in the dust filter on the 4th floor. This filter was linked to the air-locks under the cyclones via the ventilation circuit.\n\nAn expert investigation revealed that this chain of events had originated in the air-lock under the cyclones. An explosion had occurred within the air-lock. The explosion can be explained by the simultaneous presence of oxygen (since the air-lock was filling up at the time of the accident), dust at an explosive concentration (presence of particularly fine dust in suspension during the filling-up stage) and ignition energy. The most likely hypothesis concerning the ignition energy is that an electrostatic ignition source was present. The relatively high temperature of the fungicide with the unit in shut-down (up to 104&nbsp;\u00b0C as compared to 70&nbsp;\u00b0C during production) might have made the product more sensitive to such a discharge. In addition, the low air humidity during shut-down might have led to significant generation of static electricity. The hypothesis of the product self-igniting has been ruled out as the temperatures needed for self-ignition of a dust layer are far higher than those reached at the time of the event (220-250 \u00b0C versus 104 \u00b0C).\nThe explosion in the air-lock was probably followed by:\n\npropagation towards the cyclones situated above the air-lock, causing combustion of the product in the cyclone legs;\npropagation of an ember from the air-lock explosion towards the air-lock\u2019s gas vent and then to the dust filter via the ventilation pipes. As the air-lock was filling up, the vent valves connected to the ventilation system were open. The dust filter contained dust at an explosive concentration. The ember from the air-lock caused the filter to explode and then go on fire.\n",
        "Consequences": "A worker with light injuries was taken to hospital but recovered quickly.\nThe unit had to be taken apart for investigation, cleaning and repair. According to the operator, the losses totalled &euro;&nbsp;4&nbsp;million. The installations were started up again in April, three months after the accident.&nbsp;",
        "Emergency response": "The internal fire team and the fire brigade were called after staff noticed flames in the filter vents. The internal emergency plan was launched at 8.45 p.m. The firefighters brought the incident under control around 11.00 p.m. and the internal emergency plan was lifted at 11.15 p.m. The operator put in place overnight surveillance.",
        "Lesson Learned": "After the accident and before the installations were started up again, the operator:\n\nimproved monitoring of the temperature on exit from the spray drying tower, particularly during shut-downs;\nreplaced the polymer filter vents with metal vents (since they have a more accurate opening range under pressure than polymer vents).\n\nOther improvements are planned for the coming months:\n\nmaking it possible to inject water into the filter from a remote area so as to reduce the risks in the event of an explosion (reducing human consequences via a more remote intervention area and reducing material consequences via more reactive extinguishing);\nstudies on:\n\n\nthe possibility of putting in place additional temperature controls (on exit from the cyclones, on exit from the filter) so as to detect problems early;\nthe feasibility of a smouldering fire detection system so as to detect combustion earlier;\nthe feasibility of putting place additional automated security systems (emergency shut\u2011down) if an explosion is detected in the dust filter or if the filter\u2019s vents are open;\ntechnical solutions to reduce the risk of ember transmission between the air-lock/cyclone legs and the air-lock/dust filter;\nthe possibility of reducing the quantity of product in the air-lock (so as to reduce the likelihood of electrostatic discharge).\n"

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nEthylene oxide leaked through a hair-crack in a weld on the distillation column K-303 (aldehyde column) and contaminated the rock-wool insulation of a level indicator. The leak was caused by a hair-crack due to low cycle fatigue. The released ethylene oxide reacted with moisture to form non-volatile polyethylene glycols (PEG) in the insulation material. PEG accumulated in the course of time. On the day of the accident, the metal covering of the insulation was removed in order to repair the level indicator. Air leaked into the insulation material already soaked with PEG, causing its decomposition and initiating auto-oxidation. The auto-oxidation of the PEG ignited the insulation and the resulting heat flux heated the metal wall of the piping of the level instrumentation system. The heating of the stagnant liquid of the level instrument stand pipe caused the ethylene oxide to decompose. The decomposition continued into the column K-303 which exploded (the confined vapour explosion began in the lower section of the column). The gas supply line to column K-302 (carrying gases from the head of column K-303) was torn off and the escaping gas caught fire. After the pressure decreased, the flames backed into the column K-302 and caused an internal explosion (approximately 26 seconds after the first explosion). The two explosions caused the impact of debris in other sections of the ethylene oxide/glycol installation and was followed by a huge fire. The recycle gas loop was hit by debris and the released gas burned as a jet-fire. The plant fire fighting team was able to confine the fire and to put it under control in less than one hour.

For the maintenance repairs safety valves were temporarily put out of order;2- There was a gas built up (above explosion level) in the furnace because of which little oxygen was left. When putting the furnace back into operation (which also included the fan in the furnace was turned on) the explosion occurred;3- Supervision on carrying out hazardous tasks was not adequate. The management system has not been put into suficient details for people carrying out repairs. The system is 'top down' instead of bottom up';4- Even though the explosion was relatively small there were no lines of defence (LOD's) to stop the process from happening/to slow down the process.",
        "Consequences": "Three deaths and two minor injuries. Three persons were repairing a salt furnace when the due to an explosion the cover of the furnace was blown of. They were most likely hit by the cover and slipped into the furnace. The two other people (with minor injuries) were in the surroundings of the furnace not close or on top of the furnace itself.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "Recovering the bodies was hindered by the high temperature in the furnace. After the temperature was sufficiently lowered, part of the installation had to be dismantled. The victims were recovered on April 3rd.Emergency measures - Remarks: The emergency measures focused on recovering the bodies:\n\nExternal services (police, fire- fighting service) assisted in recovering the bodies of the three deceased. After the temperature was sufficiently lowered, part of the installation had to be dismantled. The victims were recovered on April 3rd.Official action taken - legal action: The public prosecution started a legal investigation concerning the accident.\nThe province &amp; local government in which the factory is located started an investigation ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons learned  - Description: Improving the safety awareness among the employees and the management of the company would be an important step forward.Measures to prevent recurrence: - an additional safe location;- modifying&nbsp; the current relevant work instructions in order to clarify tasks and responsibilities;- using only one type of gas. This will result in less pollution and - accordingly - in less repairs to the furnace;- structural change in safety concepts and safety perception within the organisation.Measures to mitigate consequences: Building in Lines Of Defence (LOD): \neven if an explosion occurs the reaction is stopped or slowed down."

The fire broke out in the pipe channel, located between a Combined plant (KP-6) and a container Finishing II. Immediately after the start of the fire, all units of Sisak Refinery plant were closed. According to the findings after the event, the cause of the fire was the leaking of gasoline that occurred during the handling of the container A-3, wherein the light petrol was stored as a raw material for the Isomerization Unit. Leakage occurred at the outlet from the tank A-3, in the vicinity of the tank, inside the tubular channel. The probable source of ignition was slight contact gasoline vapours with high-pressure steam line hot surface (80 bar, 500 degrees C), which also passes through the pipe channel. Field of two tubular channels, on both sides of the road no. 21, in&nbsp;a length of about 150 meters and 40 meters wide, was affected by a fire. During the analysis after the fire, it was found that the blind flange was not put back into place on a dead-end pipe of 250 mm diameter, and as a result, the contents of the container freely leaked out in the pipe channel. The fire that broke out at 10:48 am was successfully extinguished at 1:30 pm. Total duration of the fire is 2:42 hours.",

In addition, for the time being a company employee will be present to observe these measures. The work to be performed will be defined in a checklist and documented immediately after completion of the work..- The communication system between RWE and the company's power control room has been further improved.- RWE has technically modified the excitation equipment regulator for the gas turbines in such way that brief voltage drops in the generator should no longer cause blackouts.Further measures:- The availability of the cooling water supply is to be improved, and in particular the capacity to start up more quickly after a blackout. The same goes for the compressed air and nitrogen supply.- Further consideration is being given to improving the breathing air supply network, but no conclusion has yet been reached. The current system has a reserve of approx. 10 minutes. - Possible improvements to the compressor cooling system in the air separation plant are also to be investigated.- Regulation of the safety setting of flares in the event of power failures must be reviewed. It may be necessary to fit manual valves on certain flares to manually regulate the air/vapour supply. "

        "Accident Title": "Ruptured cistern caused by weakened ground lead to spill of sulphuric acid followed by the dispersion of a hydrochloric acid cloud",
        "Start Date": "2005-02-04 04:36:00",
        "Finish Date": "2005-02-07 01:20:00",
        "Accident Description": "This accident is being reported under the provisions of part II of appendix VI on \"specific technical interest\".A cistern containing 16,300 tons of 96 % sulphuric acid was ruptured. The entire contents of the cistern was spilled out into the tank bund and then out into Kemira Kemi AB's (KKAB) dock. When the sulphuric acid came into contact with the water there was an exothermic reaction, which produced a vapour cloud that drifted northwards along the coastline with the wind. After the spill there was approximately 2,000 tons of contaminated sulphuric acid by water in the bund. About 100,000 sq.m. of the ground surrounding the spill has been affected by the acid. An acid cloud was produced when the sulphuric acid came into contact with the salt water in the bund. The salt water consisted of approx. 0.7 w-% chloride ions. The Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) has estimated that the sulphuric acid together with the salt water produced a cloud (gas and aerosol) consisting of hydrogen chloride (HCl). During the first few minutes the maximum concentration of HCl was estimated at 6 000 mg/m3 at some spots near the scene of the accident.&nbsp; After 10 min the highest concentration was 600 mg/m3 and the concentration declined to 60 mg/m3 after 60 min. Fortunately the cloud moved along the coast line and mostly over the sea. No one outside the plant was affected.The cistern stands in a tank farm and the bund can hold a third of a cistern's volume in the event of a leak. The bund was filled with salt water when the rupture occurred. There was also another cistern containing 19,500 tons of 96 % sulphuric acid in the bund. To reduce the risk of damage to this other cistern the incident commander ordered the emptying of the bund, resulting in 1,000 to 2,000 tons of water contaminated by sulphuric acid being pumped out into the company's dock area.Meteorological conditions:The acid cloud (gas and aerosol)&nbsp; moved along the coastline but mostly over the sea. After approx. one hour and approx. 10 km away from the plant the acid concentration in the cloud was harmless. Precipitation: none, Temp: 5C, Wind Speed: 2.4, Direction: Southeast 140degrees",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause of this incident has been assessed to be a leak in a coolant supply pipe, which caused a weakening of the ground under the tank farm. This led to instability in the cistern, which subsequently split. The dyking was also damaged. Progress of events 4.2.2005:03.35 hours:&nbsp; the alarm raised about low pressure in the coolant supply pipe, which instigated the starting up of another coolant supply pump in order to maintain supply to the works. 03.45: water seen in the dyking coming from a hole east of the cistern inside the dyking.04.10: the water starts to run out over the dyking.04.36: The cistern split and 16, 300 tons of sulphuric acid emptied from the cistern in effect instantaneously.&nbsp; A high acid wave was seen moving towards the dock. Personnel in the docks area, 8 people (5 KKAB employees and 3 from Helsingborg's port), ran in different directions to reach safety. 5104 - corrosion/fatigueThe primary cause of the incident was the leak in the coolant supply pipe. The pipe is made of concrete and came into use during the first half of the 1960s, most likely 1963. The pipe had been in use through the years without any major problems ever having been identified. The only damage noted to the pipe was a leak at the pumping station in 1999.An inspection of the failed pipe after the incident detected little or no internal corrosion, but heavy external corrosion to the concrete. In certain places on the pipe the concrete has corroded so severely that the reinforcing steel has been exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appearance of that part of the coolant supply pipe that was studied suggests that the corrosion is as a result of an acidic attack on the concrete.&nbsp; According to a German DIN standard (1991) DIN 4030 and a European standard EN 260 (2001) a strong attack on concrete occurs if the pH level in surrounding water is&nbsp; &lt; 5.5 and a very strong attack is if the pH level is &lt;4.5.In 1989 a ground pollution study was carried out in the area, during which one of the sample taking points was close to the failed coolant supply pipe. At this point the pH level was measured at approx. 4 in the shallow groundwater. With this new knowledge gained the company drew the conclusion that this pH level entailed risks for strong acidic attacks on the concrete. The same conditions apply to the risk of a sulphate attack in the pipe. ",
        "Consequences": "Consequences for humansSulphuric acid&nbsp; and hydrochloric acid are extremely corrosive and can in mist form cause severe irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin. Eight persons who worked at the plant were taken to hospital for check ups, but were able to go home later that day, after they'd been examined.Because of the way the acid cloud moved no one off-site was affected by the acid cloud.&nbsp;On the morning of 4th February 2005 at 06.00 the public in the whole of Helsingborg Town was warned by a message broadcast on the radio. This message informed the public that fuming sulphuric acid (oleum) from a dock cistern in Kemiras Kopparverk dock had come into contact with water and converted to gas, which in the south-westerly wind threatened all of Helsingborg's urban area. Later during the morning information was adjusted and stated that it was 96% sulphuric acid. The situation was assessed as extremely serious and the public were warned and advised to stay indoors and close all windows and doors. The public were also advised to listen to local radio on 103.2 Hz for continuous information on this serious situation.During the rest of the morning the cordoned off exclusion zone was reduced so as to cover an area of about 1 square kilometre. This area houses approximately 7,000 inhabitants and the civil protection measures being taken greatly reduced their freedom of movement. The exclusion zone was further reduced later during the day, but still affected some 4,500 inhabitants. On Sunday (6th February) at 1700 hours the Incident Commander in Helsingborg ordered a further reduction of the exclusion zone so that it now only covered the grounds of the affected company, KKAB, surrounding the incident site. Consequences for the environmentAn area of about 100,000 sq.m. within the company's industrial area (dock area) was covered, for various durations, by the released sulphuric acid.Sulphuric acid is extremely acidic but moderately toxic for flora and fauna both on land and in water. Each year inspections of flora and fauna and substances toxic to the environment are carried out in the channel around Helsingborg, in accordance with the municipality's coastal inspection programme. At a meeting on 7th February 2005 between the company, the county administrative board and the municipality a pH level of 3.5 was recorded in the company's dock. The decision was then taken that more detailed environmental impact inspections are required and that the company shall present a programme for this to the county administrative board.&nbsp; This decision resulted in KKAB carrying out the following three studies in and outside Kopparverk Harbour.KKAB has in conjunction with a consulting firm carried out a number of pH measurements, in Kopparverk Harbour. During the first week, after the incident very low pH levels were measured in the harbour. After ten days the levels were however close to normal, with the lowest pH level being 6.5. Samples taken about two weeks after the incident from the central and outer parts of the harbour and in adjoining parts of the \u00d6resund channel showed close to normal pH levels. In none of the sample points was the pH level lower than 7.6.The municipal health and environment protection committee in Helsingborg town conducted studies of the marine environment in and outside Kopparverk Harbour on 1st March 2005. Their report states, \"Well arranged studies of watercourse fauna on 1st March 2005, just over three weeks after the sulphuric acid emission in Kopparverk Harbour in Helsingborg, do not suggest any large scale effects. All vegetation was killed in the harbour and in the harbour entrance area while clear effects couldn't be identified 300 metres away. Follow-up studies will be carried out at the end of April, when a larger area will be covered\".Another consulting firm has on commission from KKAB studied the coastal marine environment in and outside Kopparverk Harbour. The results from this report indicate that there has been a strong effect furthest in in the harbour. In the outer parts of the harbour the study shows normal conditions for the area as regards to flora and fauna.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results from the studies show that the sulphuric acid emission into Kopparverk Harbour had a serious affect on local flora in the inner and deepest parts of the harbour and harbour entrance area. The emission has been assessed by the company as not having had any major negative effects on the \u00d6resund channel. Follow ups will be carried out within the framework of Helsingborg' coastal inspection programme.KKAB has in laboratory tests, since the incident, shown that when sulphuric acid is diluted by seawater some of the chlorine is converted to hydrogen chloride gas. Calculations have shown that approximately 11.5 tons of hydrogen chloride gas can have been produced at the time of the incident.&nbsp; As hydrogen chloride gas is enveloped in a cloud of steam the hydrochloric acid was probably absorbed by the water particles and thus hydrochloric acid with a concentration of approx 4% was produced. It has not yet been determined whether or not the airway irritation that some nearby residents experienced was due to the sulphuric acid aerosol or to hydrogen chloride gas.&nbsp; The reaction that occurred between the water and sulphuric acid in the dock is not believed to have led to any gas formation, because the reaction took place under the surface and any gas produced would have been absorbed in the water above it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Community Disruption:A message informed the public that fuming sulphuric acid (oleum) from a dock cistern in Kemiras Kopparverk dock had come into contact with water and converted to gas, which in the south-westerly wind threatened all of Helsingborg's urban area. Later during the morning information was adjusted and stated that it was 96% sulphuric acid. The situation was assessed as extremely serious and the public were warned and advised to stay indoors and close all windows and doors. The public were also advised to listen to local radio on 103.2 Hz for continuous information about this serious incident.During the rest of the morning the cordoned off exclusion zone was reduced so as to cover an area of about 1 square kilometre. This area houses approximately 7,000 inhabitants and the civil protection measures taken greatly reduced their freedom of movement. The exclusion zone was further reduced later during the day, but still affected some 4,500 inhabitants. On Sunday (6th February) at 1700 hours the incident commander in Helsingborg ordered a further reduction of the exclusion zone so that it now only covered the grounds of the affected company, KKAB, surrounding the incident site. Discussion:Perhaps. in retrospect, the cordoned off zone was too large and lasted for too long, which reduced the freedom of movement of many people. Precautions taken were to ensure that no one came to harm.",
        "Emergency response": "The fire brigade was alerted at 04.40 hours on 4.2.2005. And at 06.00 the public was warned by a message broadcast on the radio.

The public were also advised to listen to local radio on 103.2 Hz for continuous information on this serious incident. However, the warning to the public was delayed more than one hour after the incident occured.&nbsp;The municipal fire brigade in Helsingborg was reinforced by fire brigades from 35 other municipalities and by the Chemical Emergency Support Unit in Sk\u00e5ne. Official Action taken - legal action:Preliminary police investigation was removed from the cause list.Official Action taken - other action:\nThe Swedish Accident Investigation Board has investigated the accident (Report RO 2008:02) and gave the following recommendations to the Swedish Rescue Services Board.1. Work for that the consequences of large amount of sulfuric acid is investigated and, if desirable, propose that the substance should be included in the list of dangerous chemicals in the Seveso Directive.2. Work for the awareness among pertinent companies and organizations of the risks involved with major emissions of sulphuric acid that mix with water containing chloride ions 3. Work for the awareness among municipal fire and rescue servicies and other pertinent authorities of the risks in cases of major emissions of sulphuric acid that mix with water containing chloride ions. 4.Work for the awareness of pertinent companies and organizations of the risk of a domino effect as a result of damages to underground pressurized conduits (pipes or cables) that are in dangerous proximity to tanks containing dangerous substances. 5.Clarify the nomenclature used in warning the general public so that the meaning of the \"Important announcement\" signal and warning information known as \"Important&nbsp; Public Announcement\" can simply and clearly be distinguished from one another in connection with municipal fire and rescue services in cases where misunderstanding otherwise may may occur.6. Work for the immediate use of the \"Important announcement\" signal as well as the \"Important Public Announcement\" warning by municipal fire and rescue services in emergencies. 7. Work for a follow-up the management organisation of&nbsp; the municipal fire and rescue services and their ability to effective&nbsp; handle a major accident. The aim of the follow-up should be to work for a purposive organisation and for the planning of sufficient and appropriate resources. The Swedish Accident Investigation Board gave the following recommendations to the Swedish Work Environment Authority:1. Consider the need to complement ordinances in the Work Environment Authority's statutes regarding pressurized devices in terms of the background of , among other things, the need to assess risks and constantly supervise those facilities corresponding to major water pipes with significant pressure and flow. 2. Work for that equipments for warning for example&nbsp; in-site sirenes have sufficient reliability.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The incident on 4th February 2005 has led to the initiation of a number of activities at KKAB, all of which have as their objective the prevention of a similar incident being repeated. Here is a description of current activities: 1. Immediately after the incident an inspection began of the whole of KKAB's industrial area, to assess if there were other important installations (from a safety perspective) in which a similar incident could occur.&nbsp; With this as a basis, and in conjunction with the following points, the company will decide on the design of future water supply.2. As the other supply pipes for the coolant in the docks area could not be guaranteed to be in a satisfactory condition, especially as sulphuric acid had leaked into the pipes during the incident, the decision was promptly taken to lay new pipes. The new pipes are made of plastic, PEH 100, and lie overground along the shoreline in the docks area.&nbsp; Risk analyses have been carried out and the new pipeline has been put in place. The company has also decided to build another pipeline parallel to the first.&nbsp; The pipes will be covered by macadam.3. At the time of the incident the pressure in the coolant supply pipe fell from about 6 to about 2 bars. The operator's instructions then were to ensure continued coolant supply to the works, which is why another pump was started. Such a powerful drop in pressure probably indicates that something serious has happened with the pipe. Therefore, the new pipes are installed with a low pressure fail-safe, which shuts off the pumps if the pressure falls below a level lower than those expected within normal operating conditions.4. KKAB has started working out what guidelines should apply for ground pipes within the company's area. Choice of material, ground conditions, proximity to installations relying on pressure, dimension and protection measures taken are some of the parameters that will be taken into account. 5. The company has also started an overhaul of routines in order to increase focus on ground pipes. "

        "Accident Description": "There is a causal link between the incident on 17&nbsp;August 2013 and an interruption in the operation of a blast furnace at the smelting works on 11&nbsp;August 2013.At approximately 6.50 p.m. on 11&nbsp;August 2013, hot blast (i.e. hot air at approx. 1&nbsp;100&nbsp;\u00b0C enriched with oxygen) escaped from the hot blast collecting pipe of a hot stove.The hole rapidly burned to a size of about 1&nbsp;m. There was a loud noise due to both the hole and the pressure of about 3.0 bar in the hot blast collecting pipe. Since the pipe is lined with refractory bricks, bricks were ejected from the damaged part of the pipe.The blast furnace was immediately shut down and made safe. The site of the incident was cooled by the plant fire service. The fire brigade was alerted and was on site.No one was injured. At no time was there any risk to the environment around the smelting works.Since the blast furnace was shut down at short notice, it could not be prepared for start-up, as normally happens in the case of scheduled shutdown procedures. When a scheduled shutdown of a blast furnace is performed, a \u2018damping batch\u2019 (increased coke rate) is introduced into the furnace about eight hours before the stoppage, which compensates for the energy lost during start-up.Because there was no damping batch and heat was lost during the five or so days when the furnace was shut down to repair the damaged area, the batch became caked and it was difficult to pass gas through the batch column in order to start up the blast furnace.After being repaired, the blast furnace was put back into operation at around 6.00 a.m. on 16&nbsp;August 2013. In the process, the hot blast was initially only fed to the furnace via 12 of the 30 tuyeres in order to allow gas to be passed through the batch column.After operation was resumed, in the night between Friday and Saturday, one \u2018blow-through\u2019 lasting 19&nbsp;seconds occurred at 1.04&nbsp;a.m. and another, lasting 45&nbsp;seconds, at 3.38&nbsp;a.m. This was caused by the sudden formation of a channel in the batch column as the batch slipped down the column, leading to disruption of the flow distribution and thus to a sudden increase in pressure, causing the tap holes to open. The tap holes are pressure safety valves pursuant to professional standard BGV C20 in the upper part of the blast furnace.Dust and blast furnace gas were released during the \u2018blow-through\u2019.&nbsp;\nThere are a total of four tap hole valves (pressure relief valves) on the blast furnace gas pipeline. The valves serve as a safety device to prevent excess pressure. The blast furnace has three tap holes, which open in succession as a function of the pressure. The fourth tap hole is opened manually only during shutdown.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Excess pressure in the blast furnace, see triggers/sequence of events.",
        "Consequences": "Contamination of cars, houses, garden furniture, etc. (approximately 160 buildings/outdoor facilities and 270 cars were affected).",

        "Finish Date": "1992-11-07 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:\nLight wind from jetty to tank farm. Temperature slightly above freezing (around the freezing point of benzene). Ground wet due to recent rains.\n\nACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nAt 02:00 hours an operator detected a smell of benzene in the proximity of pump P-104. On investigating, he detected liquid escaping from a hose attached to a valve on the pump (this valve was found to be half open and was immediately closed). A sizeable quantity of liquid, thought to be a benzene/water mixture, was observed in the pipetrack. Management was alerted. No other people were working in the vicinity of the leak. It was found that the liquid was flowing along the pipetrack to the jetty and the jetty manager was informed by telephone. A considerable quantity of liquid was found to have collected in a sump on the jetty premises (this was part of the jetty pipeline containment system but not intended to collect liquid from the jetty tank farm). There was considerable soil contamination round this jetty tank farm pipeline (this pipeline did not have a proper containment system). On investigating, it was found that plant instrumentation detected and recorded a slow leak from the tank associated with this pipeline between 20:00 hours the previous evening and 02:00 hours. The leak was too slow to show up on the control panel display and was also masked by a ship loading benzene for part of the time. No people were affected by benzene fumes and no ignition occurred. It is estimated that benzene levels in the vicinity of the leak and along the pipetrack to the sump were likely to exceed the occupational exposure standard.  An ignition would have had major consequences.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nThe leak of benzene involved the pump used to transfer benzene from the storage tank to the nearby jetty. Since the valve on a spare pressure gauge of the pump was not fully closed after a sampling operation, about 19,000 kg of benzene were lost over a period of six hours until the leak was detected.\nCAUSES:\nIn order to allow the operators to take a quality control sample of the product immediately prior to ship loading, sampling points were provided on the tanks. For the benzene tank, due to security fencing, the access route to the sampling points was circuitous and the operators had got into the practice of taking a sample at the \"degassing\" point on the pump. This practice was apparently not known to management (probably including foreman). A hose was left attached to the connection point to facilitate this operation. The practice had been on-going for some months. In this occasion the operator failed to fully close the valve. The pump was bunded, but the length of hose extended beyond the bunding and the end was lying at the pipetrack. No equipment defects or failures were involved in the leak. Underlying cause was failure of management control and supervision, together with inadequate training and failure by operator to follow operating procedures.The accident occurred because of an operator error (code 5401) that failed to fully close the valve installed on the spare pressure gauge connection on a pump. The \"cap\" was removed to take a quality control sample of benzene but this procedure was apparently not known to management above foreman level. Underlying causes were therefore the management failure in control and supervision (codes 5301 and 5305), together with an inadequate operator training (codes 5304 and 5303).",
        "Consequences": "ECOLOGICAL HARM:No significant environmental harms occurred, except the soil contamination along the pipeline track containment and in the area where the leak of benzene occurred.MATERIAL LOSS:No data are available about the cost of removal and disposal as a waste of the contaminated soil.People - Remarks: Though it has been estimated that the benzene concentrations in air in the proximity of the leak and along the pipetrack to the sump were likely to exceed the occupational exposure standard, no people were affected by benzene fumes.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:After the valve was closed, the internal company fire services were called out. They covered the spillage with \"light water foam\". Measurements of benzene concentration were taken and the area around the accident was cordoned off. The furnace of a nearby process plant was shut-down. The on-site emergency plan was not activated.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The adjacent jetty premises were informed but the off-site emergency plan was not activated. Arrangement was made to empty the sump that collected the spillage of benzene.The soil will be removed and disposed as contaminated waste (code 7601). Both on-site and off-site emergency plans were not activated. No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, it was established to improve the training of the operators and supervision.Measures to mitigate consequences: Inside the establishment, the soil decontaminate as soon as possible by flooding area with water, draining the spillage into gullies and pumping it out. The soil will be removed and disposed as contaminated waste. Outside the establishment, the pipeline track containment system decontaminated by water washing."

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nA person of the \"Movement Service\" detected on the \"transethylene\" pipeline (10\" diameter, operating at a pressure of 45 bar) an ethylene leakage inside the refinery. Immediately, he alerted the personnel in the proximity of the leakage to abandon the site and called in the company fire brigade, that intervened immediately after. Not withstanding the alert, a vehicle of an external company passed through the gas cloud, and its motor stopped due to the high concentration of ethylene in air. The driver, trying to put again in operation his vehicle, created a spark which ignited the flammable gas cloud resulting in an explosion that caused the rupture of the \"transethylene\" pipeline and its deplacement. This originated a jet-fire, fed by the ethylene escaping through the ruptured pipeline, directed towards a warehouse containing tens of barrels of liquid hydrocarbons (ethyl acetate and dimethylcycloctadiene) and sacks of thermoplastic caoutchouc (rubber). A fire started in the warehouse. The shock wave produced by the explosion caused also the displacement of a second ethylene pipeline (diameter 6\", operating at a pressure of 90 bar) located under the 10\" pipe on the piperack. The displacement caused its fall and rupture, resulting in a second unconfined vapour cloud explosion. The company fire brigade was assisted by the fire brigades of nearby companies and the local fire brigade in extinguishing the fire.  4 fire fighting vehicles were damaged by the explosion of the gas cloud but, after about 2 hours, 2 of them were already operating. 2.5 hours later a third one was operating too. The plants administration offices (120m away from the fire) and the laboratory were evacuated. The operations with road tankers (carried out about 200m away) were stopped. The cooling of the tanks nearby the warehouse (about 50m away) was activated. At 15:00 it was decided to use foam in fire fighting operations and at about 16:00 the fire was extinguished (even if caoutchouc was continuing to smoke). 4 people were burned by the fire: one, seriously injured, was hospitalized using a helicopter; the others three (slightly injured) received first aids in the surgery of the site. The whole amount of the polluted water used to extinguish the fire was collected in storage vessels in the waste water treatment. The smoke developped by the fire was not toxic.",

When the accident occurred, the installation was not classified as a Seveso plant: therefore, the accident was notified as an OECD database accident (Other Event).The accident has been classified as Level 2 of the severity scale (due to the number of injured persons).The accident is notified because the management of this type of situation (fire involving a storage of rubber or rubber products inside a building) provides many lessons: in relation to risk, but also to environmental pollution (water and air).",
        "Causes of the accident": "An external contractor company, which had a hot-work permit, was carrying out maintenance operations involving the installation-removal of metal elements, which in turn involved welding and cutting with a blowtorch. In all probability and subject to the conclusions of the judicial inquiry being carried out, the most plausible hypothesis seems to be that a small piece of molten metal ignited a slow combustion associated with pyrolysis of rubber which was stored nearby on palettes, a combustion which went on for an unknown period of time before the fire broke out.",
        "Consequences": "Nine persons were injured: 6 members of the on-site fire-brigade and, 3 members of the off-site fire-brigades&nbsp; (including a bone fracture which occurred while removing equipment after the fire was extinguished).The accident was contained to building O 24, due to the successful measures adopted by the fire fighters&nbsp; to prevent the fire from spreading to nearby buildings (namely a laboratory, oil and storage warehouses, and an electric transformer unit).Property damage was extensive. Most part of the damaged building will have to be demolished. 1.415 tonnes of gum were affected by the fire. The only important machine present in the building, an automatic weight-dosing machine (MAC BU), separated from the fire by a wall, and the majority of the chemical products were protected by the firemen and not damaged. The economic consequences were relatively limited. Only the buffer stocks of raw materials and a large portion of building O24 were destroyed. No essential installation was affected. Technical unemployment was not&nbsp; considered and the MAC BU machine was rapidly placed back into service.From the beginning of the occurrence it was possible to state that, in all likelihood, the nature of the materials involved&nbsp; into the combustion process would present limited toxic hazards, although the size of the fire and the incomplete combustion would cause a spectacular smoke plume rich in unburned particles (soot).The fire department&nbsp; performed a few basic air quality tests, in the immediate proximity of the fire, without detecting toxic compounds. The ATMO network for the air quality monitoring of the Auvergne region did not detect any dramatic increases of air pollutants. The air quality remained below thresholds over the urban area. However, there were numerous requests for information. - The real-time measurements starting from January 21st, 2000, - the mobile laboratory of the ATMO network set-up along the axis followed by the smoke cloud, - and additional measurements, on dust and particle fallout, performed by an approved organisation over the following weeks,confirmed that at the highest pollution peak, the concentrations of dust in the ambient air, outside the smoke cloud, remained much below the average daily exposition threshold recommended by WHO.All measurements data gathered until now confirm that the cloud caused a few temporary increases of dust and sulphur dioxide concentrations. Particle fallout remained very localised. The values measured remained below concentrations which can occur during unfavourable meteorological conditions for the dispersion of urban pollutants- thermal inversion anticyclonic period #No major impact was measured during or after the fire (death to fish, plant life, etc.). Afterwards, large monitoring campaigns have been carried out in order to analyse and evaluate non visible effects. The results are detailed in the paragraph \"Actions taken\". Long and complex analyses were also carried out on the sediments.",
        "Emergency response": "After detection of the fire the on-site fire brigade made an initial attempt to extinguish the fire which was unsuccessful, the fire brigade of the nearby city alerted for support arrived rapidly. The off-site fire brigade requested reinforcement from other fire-brigades in neighbouring cities and departments (regions), once confronted with the rapid spread of the fire. A total of 500 firemen were involved in the emergency response operations with a peak of 130 firemen simultaneously.The favourable environmental conditions for the dispersion of the smoke cloud associated with the absence strong wind were favourable to the emergency response operations and have permitted to avoid spreading the fire to adjoining buildings. In fact an important assembling shop and a research laboratory adjoining the building are of a fundamental importance for the operation of the site and of the company.Large amounts of emulsifiers were needed for the fire fighting operations, in fact of 100.000 litres of used estimates that 90.000 m3 requisitioned i the Auvergne region 80.000 were used for the fire-fighting operations. An analysis of the amounts of water used estimates that 90.000 m3 of extinguishing water were used during operation to extinguish the fire, a third of which were used by the sprinkling systems.While during the fire and in the following weeks, attention in the press was primarily drawn on the large smoke cloud which could be observed during extinguishing operations, actions taken by the public authorities and DRIRE have taken all possible hazards into account as soon as the accident happened.It should be noted, however, that the facility does not present elements making any major hazard as likely&nbsp; (absence of a significant inventory of toxic products, easily flammable products or explosive substances, etc.).&nbsp;",
        "Lesson Learned": "With hindsight, knowing how difficult it is to extinguish a large rubber fire, it seems that the fire could have been controlled and extinguished much better, if the means of response, which were limited, had been faster..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time delay between the start of the fire and the decision to inundate (\"deluge\") the storage facility appears to be rather long (1h20). The absence of automatic systems highlighted the fact that it was impossible to activate manually the relevant devices, as they were not accessible, being located in the immediate proximity of the flames rather than outside the building. Wherever the sprinkling valves could be activated quickly, the stocks were protected and the fire prevented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Particular attention should be given to hazardous substances (distribution, storage and traceability), to the capacity for quick and automatic response in case of an accident, to the creation of emulsifier stocks (sufficient quantities), to the preparation of retention ponds which are adequately sized for the extinguishing water in case of a fire.Although the incapacity to retain the extinguishing water appears to have had no consequences, it has become the subject of intense considerations which aim to find solutions that can be applied also to all other establishments of the same type.Moreover, in the light of the results of the technical inquiry being carried out in relation to the accident, corrective measures have been prescribed. Generally speaking, a risk assessment and an evaluation of the prevention measures have been undertaken (updating of the hazard studies, consideration of possible domino effects, possible third party expert evaluations)."

The channel has been established to collect the hexane in the event of leakage. There are no ignition sources in this channel. Concrete Canal ends at the building's outside wall between the pump and tank. Hexane could seep through the wall and formed a potentially explosive gas mixture in the room with pumps.\u00a0It was not foreseen that hexane could penetrate the wall and the room was therefore not protected against explosion. The explosive was ignited by the electrical wiring in the room with pumps. An operator notices a faint smell of hexane and decides to find out why. 3 people are about to find the reason for the smell when the explosion happens. An employee who resides outside the building next to the room with pumps die.\u00a0A fire arises\u00a0and is\u00a0extinguished by the fire brigade.

        "Finish Date": "2015-02-28 16:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "On 28 February 2015, at approximately 10.50 a.m., an explosion occurred in an area of the plant containing a shelter with a floor area of approximately 40&nbsp;m\u00b2 consisting of a wooden frame with a covering of asbestos cement sheets. The shelter housed a grinding mill (not in use at the time of the explosion) and a concrete mixer used for fine milling charcoal. Carbon dust is used in the production of the colouring mixtures used to make fireworks. According to the operator's statement, the only operation in progress in the area was the fine milling of charcoal. It is presumed that the explosion occurred as a result of ignition of the carbon dust in suspension in the free space of the mixer.",
        "Causes of the accident": "At approximately 10.51&nbsp;a.m., combustible material ignited by the fire swept through an area about 250 m away from the factory entrance. As a result of this, the roofing in the area was damaged.&nbsp;Analysis of the available evidence indicated that the event may have originated from the ignition of a cloud of combustible dust (vegetal carbon dust).There is still uncertainty regarding what caused the dust to ignite. Ruling out inappropriate behaviour by the operators and taking into consideration the favourable weather conditions: a dry, cold winter's day, one possible scenario is that the accumulated static electricity in the clothing of one of the operators may have generated a spark when he was checking on the fineness of the coal dust, thereby triggering the explosion. There was no formal procedure in place stipulating the use of special specific antistatic clothing for that type of processing or requiring that particular attention be paid to equalising the electrical potential between the equipment and the operator before work was carried out on the machine (loading, checking, emptying operations). Looking further into the security management aspects, it was found that the operation was not considered hazardous. The risk of a spontaneous explosion of coal dust was not taken into consideration in the risk analysis carried out.&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "The explosion, which occurred in the concrete mixer used for milling and located within the shelter, caused the materials making up the structure to be projected to a radius of approximately 15 to 20&nbsp;metres. The remains of the edge of the drum of the concrete mixer involved in the explosion were found, carried by the blast, approximately 130 to 150 metres away, outside the factory, on an adjacent plot of land.&nbsp;Once fire extinguishing operations had been concluded, the remains of the concrete mixer, which had been entirely ripped apart by the explosion, were found in the vicinity of the shelter: in particular, the frame from which the lower part of the drum had completely separated, which had ended up on an adjacent concrete block wall, some wooden floorboards and parts of the wooden structure of the shelter, partially burnt, and a white van damaged by the effects of the explosion.",
        "Emergency response": "Following the call to the emergency services registered at 10.51 a.m., the fire brigade, ambulance service and police came to the scene immediately, given their distance from the plant. The authorities intervening at the scene notified the prefecture and judiciary by telephone. Following the security check of the area affected by the event, the Agency department responsible for safety at work intervened. The internal emergency procedure had not been triggered as, when the event occurred, the only employees in the factory were the two individuals involved in the event.The effects of the accident were essentially confined to the areas inside the factory (the part of the mixer drum thrown outside the factory perimeter by the blast did not cause any injuries or accidents). The administrations involved, working together with the Prefecture, set up two of the five road blocks provided for in the external emergency plan (EEP) to ensure access for emergency vehicles. An air ambulance was used to transport the injured workers to hospital, as they required treatment at a major burns unit.\nThe technical assistance consisted mainly of extinguishing the outbreaks of fire on the wooden structure of the destroyed roof and the remains of the clothing the workers had left on the spot immediately after the explosion. Fire extinguishing and safety checking operations were completed at around 14.05. Then until approximately 16.05, members of the fire brigade and state police established a perimeter around the area affected for the start of the police investigation.",
        "Lesson Learned": "It should be noted that the event occurred in a part of the plant in which the operator, according to the assessments included in the \u2018Information sheet for the general public and workers on the risks of a major accident\u2019, had not anticipated any problems. It should further be noted that the substance processed in the area where the accident happened is not listed in Annex I to the Directive. The analysis of the information collected showed that the accident was possible and identifiable. In fact, explosions of combustible dust are events that have been widely studied and consequently the conditions in which they are liable occur have been officially identified. It is therefore possible to foresee the effects of a potential dust explosion and put specific measures in place to prevent both the formation of clouds of suspended dust particles, and the formation and presence of an active source of ignition. In the light of such considerations, work involving the use of combustible powders should have been included in the \u2018Risk assessment report: major accident risks and the consequences of major accidents\u2019. The only major accident risk envisaged in that report appears to be that a hypothetical explosion in building B or G would be fatal (0.14 bar) at a distance of up to 173 m, cause irreversible injuries (0.07 bar) at up to 281 m and cause reversible injuries (0.03 bar) at up to 533 m.  The plant\u2019s Safety Management System was reviewed in 2008, 2009 and 2011.\nThe 2011 review noted that the plant operator, in response to the irregularities detected previously in 2008 and 2009, drew up and established its own Safety Management System that was sufficient to meet the legal requirements. A subsequent on-the-spot check in 2013 showed that the latest instructions had been acted upon and that the operator had taken care to update the Internal Emergency Plan prompted by changes to the company\u2019s organisation chart. The decision to merge the Safety Management System (SMS) (based on the previous technical legislation) with an Occupational health &amp; safety management system (OHSMS) (based on international standard OHSAS 18001) clearly demonstrates the operator\u2019s intention to implement an overall improvement of the Plan."

Consequently the exceeding quantity of hydrogen fluoride flowed through the vent pipes along hallwalls and then into a drain for acid under repair. The drain was built from a special concrete on the ground so that the acid could not infiltrate the ground, but as a rain pipe crossed the concrete drain for acid, the acid could pass in the normal drain through an unfinished seal.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The accident resulted in release of ca 2.5 m3 of hydrofluoric acid caused by over filling of the tank. The acid was released at the connection between the venting pipe and the waste gas duct to the collecting container/pump-sump of the pickling plant. As consequence of the rupture of the event pipe, the acid flowed into the drains. Due to the presence of acid vapours the employees evacuated from the work area.CAUSES:1) The level indicator which was often faulty showed a too low level2) A safety circuit breaker installed in the cabinet opened for a not clear reason so that the safety over filling system was without tension and could not operate.",
        "Consequences": "2 persons hospitalized by release, material loss\n\nOUTSIDE THE ESTABLISHMENT\n Penetration of acid to the drain.\n\n",

EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Dilution of the acid in the drain by water from fire fighting hose and simultaneous operation of immersion pumps (70 m3/h)",
        "Lesson Learned": "MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:1. Continuation of the reparation of the acid drain and isolation of the soil of the acid filling station as requested by the industrial control (GAA).2. The safety switch is locked by an auxiliary contact that can be triggered by an acoustic or optical signal, in this way a full tank will be signaled.3. The input voltage for the safety switch will be controlled by a voltage relays with alarm&nbsp; signal.4. The procedures underlined established that:&nbsp;- before filling the tank, the functioning of the alarm system has to be tested&nbsp;- the hydrogen fluoride tank is to be filled only when its contents is less than 4 m35. A measuring device will be installed to indicate lowest level (4 m3)."

        "Finish Date": "2020-03-13 02:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "A fire broke out in an open sided, roof covered storage facility (area of 1560 square meters, hereinafter: Open warehouse) in the northern part of the plant. In the Open warehouse, 252 tons of hazardous waste was stored. The following materials were stored separately, but close to each other around the point of origin of the fire: EWC 06 05 02*; EWC 06 13 02*; EWC 18 01 06*. Based on the industrial camera records, a luminous phenomenon was visible first, then smoke started to spread in the Open warehouse. At that time, the event was discovered by a worker in the area, who alarmed the management by two-way radio. When the fire ignited, 3 workers were presented at the plant. The industrial fire brigade did not manage to take the fire under control, therefore it spread to empties and containers containing combustible materials stored nearby the Open warehouse. As a consequence of the fire, the roof of the Open warehouse collapsed and the fire spread off-site, where vegetation was burned on the territory of the neighboring sites (not dangerous establishments) and railway embankments. On the affected railway tracks cargo trains were lined up with empty uncleaned tanks. The exposed railroad cars were towed from the scene. A secondary fire hotspot was formed at the area of the Open warehouse, because of the stored flammable wastes (eg.: other fuels, including mixtures, EWC 13 07 03 *).",
        "Causes of the accident": "The operator led an investigation (event analyses) following the accident. The most relevant findings were the followings:\nA barrel - containing paint-foam waste as an organic solvent - was presumably overfilled by its previous owner before it arrived at the plant and was stored-in in the Open warehouse. The significant temperature rise before the day of the accident led to the splitting of this barrel. Next to that barrel, activated charcoal waste (contaminated raw material) was stored, and most likely spilled to the ground prior to the accident. The methyl-acetate/ethyl-acetate content of the organic solvent reacted catalytically with the activated carbon. This dangerous exotherm reaction generated a local fire, which spread and caused the rupture and ignition of some nearby barrels, containing highly flammable organic solvents. The security system did not indicate any intrusion before the fire.",
        "Consequences": "The incident did not cause any injuries. The generated combustion materials lifted quickly and reached the upper layers of the air, therefore no hazardous substances were detected in harmful concentrations within the site area or at the residential areas. The extinguishing water and foam mixed up with the hazardous materials in the storage facility and overflowed the bund. The mixture spread to the area next to the storage facility and into the rainwater drainage system. Soil replacement was required in the contaminated areas. The operator estimated the financial damage to HUF 180 million (EUR 531 616).",
        "Emergency response": "Workers on the site reported the fire to the industrial fire brigade and were able to initiate the internal emergency plan. The industrial fire brigade arrived at the scene 3-4 minutes after the alarm and began extinguishing the fire. Once it became apparent that the industrial fire brigade could not take the fire under control, the professional fire service was alarmed.&nbsp; The industrial fire brigade took part in the operation with 6 fire trucks and 11 firemen, while the professional fire service deployed 14 fire trucks and 36 firemen. During the intervention, 2 mounted and 2 installable water cannons were operated and 4 foam nozzles and 4 water nozzles were used to take the fire under control. 2 CBRN Hazmat Units performed continuous meteorological and concentration measurements on-site and in the residential area to protect the firefighters and the population around the plant.\nThe operation was hindered because the extinguishing water mixed with solvents harmful to health and dangerous to the environment, and the mixture overflowed the bund so the contaminated extinguishing water had to be pumped during the operation. Also, it was not possible to completely extinguish the fire under the collapsed roof structure until it was removed.\nSummary of the extent of the fire as the incident progressed:\n- Upon the arrival of the industrial fire brigade, the Open warehouse burned to approximately 600-700 m2.\n- The fire spread to combustible materials stored in the vicinity of the warehouse, which meant an additional 200 m2 of fire-area.\n- By the time the professional fire service arrived, the Open warehouse and the surrounding area were already on fire at 1,200 m2.\n- In total, the fire affected about 6,000 m2, which included the area of the Open warehouse itself, the outside storage area in its vicinity, the greenery within the site area and of the surrounding plants (not Seveso sites).",
        "Lesson Learned": "The most relevant lessons learned are the following:\n\n- Operators should check the filling degree of the containers, containing hazardous waste liquids, prior to receiving.\n\n\n- Operators should consider and, where appropriate, limit the amount of hazardous waste received and collected at the site.\n\n\n- The well-known, direct partner's deliveries should be subject to the same examination as the new and unknown deliveries.\n\n\n- Operators should pay attention to the deliberate design of the storage-procedures where storing together different types of hazardous wastes, considering the amount of hazardous substances at the same time, as well as their potential hazardous reactions with each other.\n\n\n- To increase safety and prevent the harmful effects of temperature rise of the stored wastes, the practice of controlling the temperature of the stored materials (manually or automated) should be developed.\n\n\n- Hazardous waste treatment plants should pay exceptional attention to the prevention of spillage and the damage of packaging on their sites.\n\n\n- In order to detect and extinguish the fires quickly, automated fire detection and extinguishing system installation should be considered for the storage facilities of flammable liquids and solid wastes, even if it would not be mandatory by an official or legal obligation.\n&nbsp;\n- During the intervention, the possible harmful effects of the extinguishing water must be monitored. Good practices that can be developed with the involvement of the firefighters can have further mitigating effects on the environmental risk of the extinguishing water used.\n"

        "Accident Description": "A pressure indicator measured incorrect and needed to be replaced. Caused by an unclear instruction, another pressure indicator with a similar number was removed. This indicator was installed again. During this activity, it was observed that acrylic acid vapours, being released out of the opened installation, crystallised immediately on the flange surface.When the production installation was started again, a pump tripped each time because the mounted pressure indicator deviated and gave high pressure alarm. The installation was then stopped because bridging of the pressure indicator was necessary. After bridging,\u00a0the pressure indicator was inspected. It was found\u00a0that the flange of the pressure indicator was leaking.\u00a0Production\u00a0was asked to\u00a0solve the leakage. Production operators\u00a0closed the manual valve underneath the instrument and\u00a0unscrewed the bolts of the flange. When removing the instrument, the operators found\u00a0liquid acrylic acid\u00a0in the pipe between the valve and the flange. The gasket was found intact. The upper flange contained crystallised acrylic acid. After cleaning of\u00a0the flange surface, a new gasket was applied on the flange. Then\u00a0the\u00a0instrument was installed and\u00a0bolts were fastened. The manual valve was opened and it was observed that the flange did not leak for 5-10 minutes.\u00a0 Temporary thermal insulation was put in place. Later the insulation was improved with aluminium covers.Two days later,\u00a0an acrylic acid smell\u00a0was observed\u00a0by an operator during a patrol tour. He saw part of the installation covered with crystallised acrylic acid and observed fluid acrylic acid rain coming down from the installation. The leak is stopped by stopping a pump. A 1cm gap between the flanges was discovered.\u00a0Investigation showed\u00a0that after torqueing the flange and insulating the instrument and pipe, the product crystals formed on the flange surface had melted, allowing a small leak to start. Vibrations on the pipe, especially those caused when starting a pump nearby, loosened the bolts and nuts so that finally a flange gap of about 1 cm\u00a0was created with a big leakage as a consequence.During the leakage between 25 to 30 tonnes of acrylic acid was spilled.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Acrylic acid vapours from inside the installation crystallise on the flange surface very quickly, even in the time between cleaning the flange surface and closing the flange.After the work the installation was insulated again and after some time the solid acrylic acid melted forming a small leak.Due to vibrations, especially from a nearby pump the bolts were loosened creating a gap of 1 cm and thus a large leak.",
        "Consequences": "- \u200bsmell nuisance (acrylic acid)- local contamination of installation",
        "Emergency response": "Access to the installation was prohibited without personnel protective equipment.The solidified acrylic acid was dissolved by applying water on it.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The accident occurred in a period of freezing ambient temperature, so well below the freezing point of acrylic acid.Under such circumstances it is impossible to make a leak tight flange connection if liquid acrylic acid (and its vapour) is in the installation.The vapour crystallizes so quickly on the exposed surfaces that a flange connection can't be made without a film of solid acrylic acid on the flange surface. The film between the flanges melts slowly when heated up after re-insulating the flange from the heat of the installation and then starts to leak.Once bolts are loosened the are loosened further by vibrations, making leaks worse.

It was managed to close at water treatment station on time, thanks to quick action the access of extinguishing water into the living water was prevented, the river was not polluted.Chronology of the event:A former, drug-addict employee of the company crawled into the warehouse on rest-day, and after inhalation of thinner vapours became stuporous, lighted a cigarette. After this fire started, which in short time spread to the whole warehouse.The person captured in the warehouse ran to the grid and shouted for help. The porter being in further distance ran to the site to check what happened. As he saw the warehouse in fire and the person within shaking the grid, ran for the key. After coming back he tried to unlock the door, but because of high heat-load he could not approach the building.The cans, drums were exploding continuously, endangering the near-by residential houses and the firemen arrived for extinguishing the fire. Because of the huge heat-load 36 fire-engine and 143 firemen were fighting against the fire in turns, for more than 9 hours. For fire-fighting there were used 33000 litres of extinguisher-foaming material, 5000 kg of extinguisher powder and 3.5 million litre of water. The large volume fire-extinguishing water moved via the channelling toward the Danube. It was managed to close at water treatment station on time, thanks to quick action the access of extinguishing water into the living water was prevented, the river was not polluted. One person - the causer of fire - died in fire, 10 firemen suffered injuries.The fire started between 08.40-08.50 on Saturday 26th June 1988 in the paint-store of warehouse. The detection of fire was enabled by smoke, flames and silent popping voice coming from the building (08.53). The fire-station was informed by reception via direct fire-alarm telephone. The plant staff (3 porters, 1 electrician) did not tried to extinguish the fire. The alarm-notices from the residential people arrived from 08.54, in which huge smoke and five floor high flame was mentioned.At 08.58 - based on exploration - the whole warehouse was in fire, the fire endangered the open-air storage place near to the warehouse. Despite of quick action the spread of fire to cans could not be prevented, the plastic cans placed on pallets melted and the linseed oil stored in them fired floated as lava, causing direct danger of life of gusher-leaders and danger to fire-engines. The liquid in fire on the yard endangered two near-by buildings (paint-stores), the spread of fire to these buildings could have caused incalculable consequences. Because of quick spread of fire the fire-fighting leader increased the alarm-level at 09.06. At 09.08 the attempt for rescue of person captured by the warehouse, the room locked with grid was in fire, the man did not show sign of life. It was managed to force back the liquid in fire between the two stores (09.12), the fire could not spread further. A part of liquid in fire flew to the lower level underlying building site behind the warehouse, inflaming the tool hut standing on that area and/or endangering four pressure-bottle fixed to the hut. The fire-fighting leader ordered protection and evacuation of bottles, but two of them exploded.The fire-fighting was done continuously by powder-, foam- and water-gusher. It was not managed to form monolithic foam-covering neither with operating foam-gusher and foam-guns together, because the liquid in fire was proved strong antifoam agent, furthermore the storage mode of materials made more difficult of forming the foam-covering (on pallets, above each other). After recognition of antifoam agent the fire-fighting leader ordered the supplementation of foam-forming compound, what would have been justified to be done earlier.The heavy smoke threatened some of the near-by residential houses, therefore action was taken to evacuate 17 person - mainly elder aged people.By 10.10 with involving other emergency units, and/or operating the powder-gusher discontinuously it was managed to stop the fire of liquid on the yard, there were no reinflame. The fire could be controlled inside the building. Meanwhile the foam-forming compound was off, the fire-fighting and cooling continued with water. The sump gullys were occluded by balled fat, the water could not drain. The liquid from the cans exploded spread on the surface of water in seconds, and compassed the gusher leaders, this way suffering burn injuries. At 10.16 arrived the foam-forming compound, the fire-fighting with foam continued. By 10.39 the fire was 90 %, by 10.45 totally extinguished. At 10.45 some heated box under the pallets exploded and the liquid spread reignited the fire, the fire-fighting continued. The flash of liquid spread on surface of water caused injuries again at 10.56.Because of serial reinflames and explosions inside and in the environment of the building the total extinguishing of the fire could not be achieved, but controlling the fire-sources the fire did not spread to larger area. The fire-fighting leader ordered the notice of Water-treatment Company, i. e. huge volume of extinguishing water polluted with high quantity chemicals will arrive to water treatment plant, they were asked to do the actions needed and/or to clean the occluded sump gullys at site. Thanks to the notice on time the responsible persons separated the polluted water, this way no polluted extinguishing water entered the Danube.At 11.25 the mortal remains of victim was found.It was not managed to prevent the evaporation of inflammable liquid spread, causing continuous reinflame, for solving this fireman captain leader of Operative Unit of Department of the Interior's Fire-fighting National Headquarter, proposed forming of 1,5-2 meters high foam-covering, which was a key tactical solution in view of fire-fighting. The foam-covering was formed by AKG-800 foam-maker and with EVAM foam-forming compound. The equipment was used up to now only in oil industry for consolidation of extinguishing of large-surfaced fire, evolved in salvager. The fire and smoke-production stopped in 10 minutes after the equipment arrived at site and operated, producing total foam-covering on the site affected. The produced foam-covering was stable also on morning of next day, there was no need for complementation. The total extinguishing of fire was effected on the whole site and in the building after introducing the foam-covering (22.08).",
        "Causes of the accident": "Trespass of unauthorized person for inhalation of narcotic vapours.It is presumed that a former, drug-addict employee of the company crawled into the warehouse on rest-day, and after inhalation of thinner vapours became stuporous, lighted a cigarette. After this fire started, which in short time spread to the whole warehouse.\u00a0 ",
        "Consequences": "Area Concerned:Before the fire there were about 80 sort of inflammable and explosive materials in the building.Thanks to quick and precise action the spread of fire to most of near-by buildings could be prevented, saving this way the major part of stocks stored there.The building of warehouse and the major part of materials stored there were destroyed in fire. The neighbouring two stores and/or the outer part of detergent store were lightly damaged, but they are suitable for normal use. The materials stored on pallets on the yard and/or 10.5 tons of detergent was destroyed.People - remarks:10 firemen suffered burn injuries during pool fire and/or during a BLEVE.There were residential zone north and east from the accident site, the smoke containing toxic and carcinogenic compounds endangered these areas. The huge volume product of combustion was spreading toward the side of residential zone, but it was rising quickly and it was thinning. In case of worsening of meteorological conditions there would have been affected approx. 5000 residents inside of a circle of 700 m radius. Only from the nearest, on the thin populated area standing houses in direction of the wind, by way of precaution 17 residents - mainly elder people - were evacuated.Ecological Harm:There were residential zone north and east from the accident site, the smoke containing toxic and carcinogenic compounds endangered these areas.

During the accident the traffic was managed by the police in the neighbouring streets.Discussion:The 1000 m2 store and the major part of materials stored there were destroyed, the neighbouring storehouses were damaged, too.If the spread of fire to neighbouring storehouses could not be prevented, then it could have incalculable consequences.Affected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of :  Ecological component: residential area (covered by toxic cloud) - Affected YesEcological component: land (with known potential for long term ecological harm or preventing human access or activities) - Affected Yes",
        "Emergency response": "The porter alarmed the fire alarm centre of fire-chief headquarters after detecting the fire by direct fire alarm phone. Extinguishing of fire was not attempted by plant personnel until arrival of fire brigade. Porters opened the entrance gates and started alarming the management of the company. The chief of fire alarm centre retrieved the fire-fighting plan of the establishment from the computer database and started execution of prescribed III. Order alarm (alarming 14 units in the first circle). The arriving units performed marching within the norm time arriving at 08:58, there was no adversely effecting factor hindering the marching of fire brigades. The fire-fighting leader confirmed the fire order III classification on the basis of exploration at site, but because of rapid spreading of fire in large area it was classified to V order at 09:06. The fire alarm centre executed the V. order alarming very fast (alarming further 6 units). Involvement of further units were necessary for exchange (from 09:42 9 units) and later for cleanup work and exploration (6 units). Aggregately 36 fire-engines and 143 firemen arrived to the fire site. According to the exploration the storage building was entirely in fire, and the fire was endangering the open air storage area next to the storage building. In spite of quick intervention the propagation of fire could not prevented, the plastic canisters located on palettes were molten and linseed oil stored in canisters burned and like burning lava flow away directly endangering the jet directing firemen and fire-engines. It is necessary to note, that the fire-chief was not aware of the content of plastic canisters, he got no information regarding this matter at site. The burning liquid spilled in the yard endangered the two neighboring buildings (paint storages), spreading the fire to these buildings would result in incalculable consequences. Because of rapid spreading of fire the alarm classification the fire-fighting leader increased the alarm classification order at 09:06. He concentrated the forces to this place for prevention of propagation of fire.The fire was extinguished using 36 fire engines and 143 firemen during 9 hours 1 minute. The tremendous amount of combustible material, which was stored in different vessels on palettes made the fire-fighting very dangerous and difficult. From the fire signalization arriving in the same time one could come to the conclusion that large fire occurred. The alarm centre made alarming according to the fire fighting plan, made preparation for alarming of forces prescribed for assistance. The exploration was not hindered, the detached storehouse and its surrounding was well-arranged.The fire escalate in very short time to the entire area of the storehouse. The heat radiation was very intensive, but the intervention prevented escalation of fire to the adjacent storehouses. Prevention of damage in the close vicinity of storehouse was not possible, materials, vehicles located there were seriously damaged. Because of stored different type of chemicals there was explosion danger and pollution effect of released combustion products represented serious endangerment for the environment. It was late information for the fire-fighting brigade that person is present in the storehouse. It was problem, that nobody could give information about types of stored materials at site. The fire-fighting management was performed at the beginning by basic management mode, later the by the organization of fire-fighting group. 4 brigades were organized: 1-1 brigade on the left and right sides of the storehouse 1 brigade for ensuring fire-fighting material supply1 brigade for ensuring fire -fighting water supply.The role of management staff which was complemented with principals arriving to the site was consultative, because of static fire-fighting situation. Good co-operation between management staff and fire-fighting leader facilitated the success of new tactical solution used at first time. Combined extinguishing method was determined for extinguishing of the fire: extinguishing with powder -gusher, foam-gusher and foam jets the cooling with water jets. Using powder gushers burning of liquid spilled in the yard managed to cease, and fire in the storehouse partly control. The very intensive foam braking effect of burning materials no foam cover could formed, because 80-90% of foam was destroyed in short time. Operation of 12-15 simultaneous foam jet would be required for successful fire-fighting, but only one foam-gusher was available on duty in the capital. The series of explosion of storage vessels reignited several times the already extinguished fire. Use of AKG-800 foam-maker for forming ensured successful fire-extinguishing because of 1,5-2 meters high foam-covering. The large weight of AKG-800 foam-maker and its manual transportation in very dangerous site represented large difficulty; the fire members of fire-fighting group had no previous information about the equipment. Injuries occurred in spite of necessary care and disciplined observation of accident prevention measures, serious injury did not occurred, fast reaction of gusher-leaders saved colleagues in danger. Heat resistant protective clothing was not used, because it was obvious that the fire extinguishing will take longer than 20 minutes time. Heat resistant protective clothing the visibility is restricted, the movement is hard, in case of present fire observation of large area and fast reaction was necessary because of rapid changes. As result of high heat radiation the external surface of conventional protective coat was melted. The medical ambulance cars of emergency department ensured the treatment and transportation to hospital of injured people. The police closed down properly the surrounding area, executed the necessary traffic control. The police took part in information and rescuing of residential people, ensuring the public order. Experts of Sewage Company On The Basis Of received in time information took the necessary measures, as a result no contaminated fire-fighting water entered into the river Danube. Food supply of fire-fighting staff working continuously for many hours was not properly organised, 4 hours was necessary to organise the requested food supply by on duty officer of the Fire-Fighting Headquarter.\u00a0",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Strengthening the surveillance safety. There are few tools available for fire prevention of such and similar actions. The fire protection authority shall make the necessary measures during installation of facility, compliance with regulations and observing the operation instructions determined by plant shall be checked. It is suggested that during fire protection authority's inspection more emphasis shall be exercised to inspection of fire protection activity of the companies. The stereotyped fire protection instructions of the companies using only general terms shall be requested to be reviewed, and reworked in compliance with concrete fire protection requirements of given activity. Measures to mitigate consequences: It was proven, that high capacity foam makers might be necessary in the territory of capital. It was initiated to produce such foam makers for the capital. It is possible to reduce by seconds or minutes the time elapsing between arrival of fire signalization and initiating the fire alarm by expansion of computer system of Alarm Centre of Fire-Fighting Headquarter. It is necessary to provide suitable generally usable working clothes, boots and protective coat for the on duty staff. It is necessary to ensure protective drinks and meals supply system for staff working at accident site. "

        "Causes of the accident": "As far as is currently known, the cause is:The digester in question was filled with beet chips and biogas production fell sharply. As more hydrogen sulphide and hydrogen was produced, the container was separated from the system on 9 June 2016.Attempts were made to stimulate gas production by adding lime (to raise the pH value). This resulted in a large amount of foam being produced, which led to an increase in pressure in the digester.

        "Accident Description": "The accident occurred at 10:45 hrs on 19 April 1996. At that time an explosion occurred with practically immediate consequences on materials and persons involved. The help request has been made by a radio mobile team of the \"Carabinieri\" (police) from the barracks \"Camisano\" ; immediately after they heard a strong explosion they arrived on the place. Following the call by the police the firemen of Crema arrived within appr. 15 minutes on place, later also the firemen of Cremona. The personnel of the establishment received first aid. At that time, the personnel consisted of 7 persons, not present were the director general and 2 people from the administrative personnel. The director general declared at the on-spot-investigation that there were no written procedures for the distillation since the process was not considered to be so complicate. This process was of discontinuous load type (batch process). Besides the fixed installations in the factory there were various plastic drums having a volume of 1 m3 each whose content was not verifiable because they had no labels. For these items the director general of the company declared that they were used for intermediate or final storage of the distilled. For the same purpose, a mobile vessel of about 6 m3 capacity was used.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Loss of process control, probably due to a missing precise knowledge of all the substances involved in the process (including impurities), with resulting missing possibility of forecast of possible uncontrollable exothermic reactions.",
        "Consequences": "PERSON-RELATED:At the moment of the accident there were 4 employees: a secretary, the distillation plant chief, a technician of other works, a generic maintenance worker charged to&nbsp; move recipients containing recovered substances and to be treated. The plant's chief received fractures on left elbow and injuries from splinters in the right arm and was sent to hospital for recovery. The other 3, apparently unhurt, were checked in the hospital following their shock state.MATERIAL-RELATED:Various equipment received unrecoverable damages (column, receiving vessels and various accessories), so that the plant is no longer operable. Due to the explosion the roof was demolished, also due to 14 m upwards missile impact of a large part of the reboiler (after crossing two layers of strengthened concrete), composed by a part of the mantle and of the welded bottom (2m diameter, 2.5 m length, 6 mm thickness). A metallic fragment, having the weight of 40 kg, was hurled 10 m away after it had perforated a plate of 0,8 mm of the inlet gate of an adjacent establishment 25 m away from the point of explosion. Glass broke and there was damage to the walls and metallic structures of surrounding buildings up to 100 m. Further, damage to the wooden and metallic structures of a house being 70 m away from the explosion point.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "Close to the establishment (within a radius of about 200 m) there were 2 industrial plants (one of them treating chemical substances), an industrial storage facility for marble works and a one-family house on two floors. The competent authorities ordered evacuation for 24 hours of the establishments and of the private house as a preventive measure because of the uncertainty related to the still dangerous situation following the accident (uncertainties because of missing knowledge of type and number of substances stored in the plant and due to difficult assessment of the possibility of a further evolution of the accident on behalf of the emergency team). The competent authority (Procura della Repubblica di Crema) has put the plant under sequestration and started an official investigation.Official action taken - legal action: The plant is under a status of sequestration by the competent local authority, which imposed an official investigation in order to determine the causes of the accident and the eventual responsibilities.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: As known on the basis of an on-spot-investigation, the company had not presented the declaration foreseen by the Italian legislation corresponding to the Seveso Directive 82/501/EEC. The reason of the missed submission was in the discrepancy between the amount of the substances present in the establishment and the amount foreseen by the declaration obligation. The consequences of the accident should have been more serious if the splinters had hit places frequented by more persons or if they had reached the tank trucks or other equipments in the nearby establishment which treats chemical products. Considering the fact that the destillation products present in the warehouse were highly flammable, the actual consequences have been less serious than those principally possible. In the light of the above considerations it is useful to study again the problems which could be present in the case of runaway reactions and the limits that are foreseen by the Directive for flammable substances should be studied, particularly in cases in which establishments are not isolated."

        "Causes of the accident": "Causes: During change of production operations in the plant, authorisation for pumping&nbsp; from the tank to the mixer with a pipeline usually used for that purpose was given, the pipe-line was not normally connected to the sewage tank. The pipe-line connecting the tank to the mixer had previously been connected during production tests to another piping system with a connection to the sewage water tank. It was planned to dismantle the new connection to the sewage water tank for the test production.At the same time as change of production operations were performed in one part of the plant, the control system of the installation part (equipment) not needed for the new production process was tested with pressurised water. The connection to the sewage water tank was maintained for that purpose.Immediately before beginning the new production process and pumping operations, two employees walked along the pipe-line to check independently of each other the connection between the tank and the mixing vessel.They did not discover the faulty connection to the sewage water tank, this may be due to the complexity of the piping system and to the recent fact of the connection to the sewage water tank.After starting pumping operations the stirring vessel was monitored for&nbsp; the amount of incoming polychloro-acetone directly on the stirrer and from the control room. The level increase in the stirring vessel was monitored from the control room. An additional crosscheck between outflow of the tank and inflow of the stirrer had not been considered necessary because of the low flow-rate which had been chosen.Announcements over the loudspeaker system by the on-site fire brigade were not audible in that part of the installation.",

        "Accident Description": "On 15 February 2010 a release of about 29 tonnes of EL fuel oil occurred in a tank farm during a transfer operation, causing environmental damage. The release took place at the coupling of a pipe bend flanged to a product pipe, to which a DN 80 hose was attached to connect to a mobile pump. The mobile pump was intended to drain an EL fuel oil tank by about 04:45 during the night shift. For this the mobile pump was set up near the tanks on an open space and connected to the tanks by means of flexible hosepipes with the appropriate piping.After the pump was switched on the process was checked by employees and no anomalies or leaks were found. The workers returned to the tank farm control room, from where the operation was monitored on the basis of the oil level (rise in the level in the tank to be filled). 25 minutes after the start of pumping the level indication on the monitor was seen to switch from rise to fall. Alarmed by this, the employees immediately returned to the pump and found that the hosepipe had become detached at the coupling of the pipe bend on the product pipe. EL fuel oil from the filled tank was being released in free flow out of the parted hosepipe and at the same time via the still running pump out of the tank to be emptied. The escape of fuel was stopped by manually closing slide valves on the tanks and pipeline and by switching off the pump.The hose concerned is a standard chemical hose. The coupling is a 'filling pipe' coupling or 'tank wagon' (TW) coupling according to DIN 28450 (EN 14420-6). Such couplings can be regarded as standard, especially in the petroleum industry. They are also called quick connect couplings. The male and female parts are put together and the connection is made in slightly under a single turn. The coupling is then secured or self locked. Safety function:\nSlide valves on tanks and piping closed manually and pump switched off.\nAs much as possible of the fuel oil released in the sump of the pump was pumped back into the tank.\nFurther action was taken in accordance with the site's general emergency response plan (AGAP) to limit the environmental damage. The environmental damage was caused by a combination of shortcomings and errors:\n1.\tDue to the infrastructure, some tank farms do not have a stationary system for dealing with residues, which is why it was necessary to use mobile equipment.\n2.\tA non return valve fitted on the pressure side when the mobile equipment was assembled would have prevented a reflux of product and considerably reduced the extent of the damage. Ultimately, however, product would still have been released due to the still running pump and the open connection.\n3.\tIt has not been possible to determine conclusively why the tank wagon (TW) quick connect couplings became disconnected.\n",

Another outside firm made two boreholes with a diameter of 800 mm and a depth of 8 metres in the damage zone. 300 mm diameter pipes were inserted into these boreholes in order to extract the released oil from the subsoil by suction. Oil that had already collected in the borehole was immediately extracted by the vacuum truck on the spot.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Change the procedure for using mobile pumps.\n-\tTechnical measures: use non return valves and flange connections instead of tank wagon couplings, including for hosepipes.\n-\tOrganisational measures: mobile pumps to be used only on impervious subsoil and/or with permanent monitoring by a 'hosepipe watch' on the spot. The Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Agency for the Environment, Measurements and Nature Conservation would like to draw attention in particular to the following points and findings:\n1.\tHose couplings are detachable connections. They are used in a number of standards in the petroleum industry and the chemical industry for temporary pumping operations and are widespread.\n2.\tMaking a connection requires knowledge of how to operate the coupling system and its particular features. Employees must be given appropriate training for this.\n3.\tParticularly in the case of use in the open, and therefore including in inclement weather conditions, there may be interference or risk involved in making the connection due to rain, snow, ice, contamination, foreign bodies, etc.\n4.\tHoses and couplings must be checked for damage and/or wear and regularly tested.\n5.\tVisual leakage checks, usually carried out at the start of a pumping operation, give no guarantee that couplings will stay leaktight throughout the process.\n6.\tIf a coupling does fail, considerable quantities of liquid will be released via both cross sections ('male' and 'female' parts) in a short space of time.\n7.\tMeasures which will detect the failure of a hose coupling immediately are to be recommended. One solution is to have permanent monitoring by a 'hosepipe watch'.\n8.\tFor safety reasons, correctly assembled flange connections are technically preferable to hose couplings.\n9.\tNon return valves can limit the amount of liquid released in the event of failure.\n10.\tMobile pumps should be used only on an impervious subsoil.\n11.\tWherever possible, rigid piping should be used for transfer pumping operations.\n12. Transfer pumping operations must undergo a systematic risk analysis. In the medium term: make and install stationary residue systems for the tank farm.\n"

        "Causes of the accident": "The safety valves opened because of excess pressure caused by propane entering the butane tank. According to the operator, the pump attendant in charge of transfers that day left a pump intake valve open when transferring propane, thus allowing contact between the butane tank and the spherical tank containing propane. The following came to light after the event:\n\nthe unloading procedure did not specify that the opening/closure of the selector valves had to be checked;\nthere was no interlock on the shut-off devices on the selector valves for the butane line;\nthere were no visual or acoustic high-pressure alarms at the LPG pumping station;&nbsp;\nthere was no high-pressure safety interlock;\nthe preliminary risk analysis ruled out with no explanation the scenario of propane entering the butane tank.\n",

The water spray was targeted at the butane and propane tanks. A pump attendant shut off an open valve situated at the inlet of a compressor allowing suction from the butane tank to be activated. At 12:50 p.m. the safety valves closed. At 1:00 p.m., the LPG pumps were started up again in closed circuit in order to draw up the liquid butane and release it into the vapour space so as to reduce the temperature and pressure. At 1:15 p.m., a butane tank truck was connected to one of the unloading stations. The loading arm was connected to the vapour space and the butane from the truck was emptied into the tank. This caused the pressure to quickly fall to 4.6 bar. The gas was fed into another spherical tank. At 1:20 p.m., water stopped being sprayed and normal activity resumed. At 4:20 p.m., pressure in the butane tank was 2.3 bar. Patrols to monitor the pressure in the butane tank were organised for the weekend.",
        "Lesson Learned": "As a result of the accident, the operator took the following actions:\n\nall possible points where the butane line and propane line could come into contact with each other were identified;\ntechnical solutions were put in place to prevent the lines coming into contact due to human error;\na high-pressure alarm system was installed;\nthe utility of putting in place a high-pressure safety system was examined;\nthe preliminary risk analysis was supplemented and the hazard assessment was adapted;\nprocedures and the internal emergency plan were updated so as to describe the actions to be taken in scenarios of this type;\na procedure for unloading operations was created.\n"

        "Accident Description": "On 9&nbsp;September 2013, there was a release of crude benzene on a tank farm when a road tanker was drained. At around 7.42&nbsp;p.m., the driver of the road tanker connected the facility-side hose with dry coupling to the tanker using an adapter. The flow path up to the last valve on the tanker was then cleared by opening the valves; the valves of the sampling equipment were opened.&nbsp;\nWhen the tanker driver realised that the hand lever of the valve on the tanker could not be operated by means of the adapter and dry coupling, he disconnected the coupling without closing the valves on the facility side. This caused residual substances still in the hose from the previous draining to be released due to the tank pressure applied via the sampling equipment.\nThe residual substances released struck the tanker driver's face and upper body, even though he was wearing the appropriate protective clothing and helmet with protective visor. The tanker driver collapsed. An emergency call was made immediately and first aid was started. After being given first aid by the emergency services, the tanker driver was taken to hospital, where he died after about one hour.\nThe above is a description of the facts currently known.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Failure to close the valves on the facility side of the connection line to the pump.\nThe valves on the facility-side flow path to the pump were not closed.",

        "Emergency response": "Closure of the shut-off valves in the pump flow path.Removal of the released product.Closure of the site area until investigations had been provisionally concluded.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Technical measures:\n1) In order to prevent product from being released from the coupling when work instructions are not followed due to human error, the adapter used has been modified.Non-return valve on the adaptor:The adapter for use on tankers without a dry coupling counterpart is fitted with a non-return valve to prevent any residual products in the hose from being released if the union nut comes loose without having disconnected the dry coupling.\n2) Pneumatically operated valves around the sampling equipment:The pipe connection to the sampling equipment, which is connected in parallel with the product path, has been fitted with pneumatically operated valves, which only open when the drain pump is running.Organisational measures:\n1) Instructions to tanker drivers:The instruction forms used for the initial and annual training of tanker drivers have been updated and are now available in eight languages. Drivers are given a copy to keep.New tanker drivers are trained by operator staff in how to operate the installation and are allowed to operate it independently only once they have completed this training.\n2) Work instructions:The work instructions for tanker drivers have been amended in line with the modified installation and allow tankers to be drained:- with the necessary PPE but without using a respirator mask when the dry coupling is used directly, i.e. without the adapter;- only with the necessary PPE and using a respirator mask as an additional safeguard against swallowing and inhalation of product residues when an adapter is used.&nbsp;\nThe work instructions are posted in the facility in three languages. The following additions have been made:- Images showing how to correctly connect to the facility;- Operating instructions concerning the hazardous substances to be drained;- Operating instructions concerning PPE to be used, including breathing protection.&nbsp;\n3) Risk assessment of the tanker draining facility following the modification:After testing and introduction of the above-mentioned modification, a new risk assessment was carried out on the tanker draining facility by the external works safety expert. The technical and organisational measures that had been implemented at the time of the assessment were found to be \u2018completed and effective\u2019.\n&nbsp;\n4) Working towards fitting tankers with dry coupling counterparts:\nThe tank farm operator itself has no business relationship with the transport companies delivering the product; it merely acts as a warehouse keeper for a fee.\nA letter was sent to the product purchaser asking it to encourage the transport companies delivering the product to fit tankers with dry couplings, in order to increase safety during transhipment and prevent releases of product.\n&nbsp;\n5) Informing offices in the parent company:\nThe relevant offices of the parent company (international group) have been informed. The incident and possible solutions are being evaluated to prevent similar occurrences."

        "Finish Date": "2014-09-06 07:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "\nAt around 12.00 noon, the emergency services were on the ground in Saint-Louis in response to complaints received from several dozen residents about pungent odours. A patrol carrying out visual and olfactory checks traced the source of the odour to inside a chemical plant. The operator was contacted and reported that, between 11:00 and 11:30 a.m., a tank containing a preparation of ethyl acrylate based lubricant (inflammable, highly reactive and highly odorous: odour threshold of 0.001 ppm) had accidentally risen in temperature (118&nbsp;\u00b0C instead of 58&nbsp;\u00b0C) and pressure (1 bar instead of vacuum conditions). The tank was rinsed out and degassed. The gases emitted were diverted towards the unit\u2019s scrubber where they were filtered, condensed and scrubbed. The wash water was collected in a retention pit pending pumping and treatment by a wastewater treatment plant in Switzerland.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "The incoming shift took up their posts in the manufacturing workshop at 5.00 a.m. They were not informed (or were incorrectly informed) by the outgoing shift that the tank containing ethyl acrylate was full and awaiting continuation of the manufacturing process. Thinking that it was empty, the new shift did not think to check its status. In the control room, the shift foreman saw on the screens that the tank\u2019s vacuum pump, allowing a reaction control pressure to be maintained, was in operation. He decided to shut it down because he thought that the previous shift had forgotten to do so. Due to the increase in pressure in the tank as a result of the pump being shut down, the manufacturing reaction restarted and went out of control. As it was not possible to regulate the flow of gases in the tank\u2019s relief conduit (DN 500 and on-off valve), the gases from the reaction were released too quickly to allow the unit\u2019s purification systems to neutralise them (insufficient size).",
        "Consequences": "The ethyl acrylate released from the scrubbers&rsquo; chimneys could be smelled in the vicinity.",
        "Emergency response": "The tank was rinsed out and degassed. The gases emitted were diverted towards the unit\u2019s scrubber where they were filtered, condensed and scrubbed. The wash-water was collected in a retention pit pending pumping and treatment by a wastewater treatment plant in Switzerland.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The owner reiterated the requirement for the incoming shift to systematically check the production line tanks, regardless of the information given by the outgoing shift. Awareness was raised among staff of the need to follow instructions precisely and a technical change was made to the system for releasing gas from the tank to the unit\u2019s condensers and scrubbers (fitting the relief conduit with a low-diameter bypass equipped with a valve)."

        "Accident Description": "The cause of the fire is not yet clear. A member of staff discovered the fire as a result of the formation of smoke. He immediately alerted the fire brigade which, after a few minutes on site with fire engines and turbo extinguishers, had the fire under control and then cooled the adjacent parts of the plant. The plant was automatically shut down as a result of the reduction in pressure of the oxygen. The dynamics of the shut-down operation resulted in flares becoming extinguished. The fire also caused a partial failure of the supply of control air. It was not possible to re-ignite the flares until that failure had been rectified, and approx. 1 000 kg of unburned naphthalene was emitted.At 9.55 a.m. on 30 May 2011, there was a fire in an oxygen compressor in an acetylene plant.\nA member of staff discovered the fire as a result of the formation of smoke. He immediately alerted the fire brigade, which, after a few minutes on site with fire engines and turbo extinguishers, had the fire under control and then cooled the adjacent parts of the plant.\nThe fire was extinguished and the subsequent cooling measures were completed by 10.44 a.m.\nThe plant was automatically shut down. Cabling running above the compressor was damaged in the fire. This led, among other things, to a failure in the supply of control air from two flares and prevented the flares from being ignited. This failure caused up to approximately 600 kg of crude naphthalene to be released, unburnt by the damaged flares, between 10.37 a.m. and 2.59 p.m.\nThere was no harm to people or the environment. The material damages are concentrated in the area of the oxygen compressor and other technical equipment located in the area affected by the fire.\nNo individual person actively made a mistake. A hot spot created by a foreign body in the machine is considered to be the cause.\nSafety measure:The plant was automatically shut down as a result of the reduction in pressure of the oxygen.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The final conclusion is that the most likely cause of the present damage is a hot spot in a compressor starting a metal fire in the lower casing.\nThis hot spot may have been caused by a foreign body which entered the machine through the inlet. Sufficient frictional heat to ignite metal may have been generated upon impact with a turbine blade or after acceleration and deflection upon impact with the wall of the inner casing of the machine.\nParticular evidence for this chain of events is provided by the fact that when the trapping sieve (fitted on the inlet of the oxygen blower) was removed after the incident it was found to have mechanical damage and to contain a hole. It had been punctured. It is therefore obvious that a foreign body had entered the machine and triggered the incident.",
        "Consequences": "One person with suspected shock Fire damage to parts of plant (EUR 2 000 000)",
        "Emergency response": "Internal: The on-site fire brigade used water to cool the parts of the plant for the duration of the fire. External: Alerting of the surrounding plants.",
        "Lesson Learned": "- All trapping sieves were removed and checked for particles and damage. The inlet pipes were also checked for loose parts at the access points to the oxygen blowers.\n- Energy pipelines and signal lines damaged in the fire were removed from the critical areas that would be affected by a similar incident.\n- In addition to the cut-offs that had already been installed (pressure cut-off inlet low/outlet high, bearing lubricant oil temperature high/oil pressure low, axial thrust high), a temperature monitor has been fitted to the fire/noise protection casing of the blower, with an alarm in the measuring station, in order to be able to detect an increase in temperature even earlier, if necessary.\n- There are important supply lines in the area of the blowers. A sprinkler system will be installed there as soon as possible in order to be able to provide intensive cooling in a short space of time. Water is supplied both by means of a fixed pipeline (deionised water network) and by means of a water hydrant, which can be connected by the fire brigade in an emergency.\n- The safe operation of the flares was discussed in detail with the operator. In order to optimise ignition of the burners, a trial is being carried out on one acetylene flare and one lean gas flare in which conventional ignition is replaced by self-priming, electric ignition that does not rely on compressed air. If successful, the cracked gas flares will be retrofitted with this system."

        "Accident Description": "Fire broke out in one of the dry-goods warehouses that was used for storing and re-packaging swimming-pool chemicals in the early hours of 28 May 2012 and was reported on 999 by a member of the public. London Fire Brigade attended at 03:30 and eventually 70 Fire-fighters and 16 pumps were involved in tackling the blaze, bringing it under control by 06:50. Damping-down operations continued until 18:30, when the Fire Brigade handed control of the site back to Brenntag. The establishment was un-attended at the time of the fire and over the preceding weekend, so there were no injuries amongst staff. Although the fire caused a smoke plume visible across east London, there have been no reports of any adverse health impact to public or emergency services staff. Firewater was contained on-site using tertiary containment areas and later discharged to foul sewer under agreement with the sewage undertaker. There was high media interest in the fire, particularly because of the site\u2019s emergency siren which was activated by the fire and was audible across the local area. Operators initial assessment is that about 75% of the inventory of the dry-goods warehouse was lost, either to fire or in the fire-water: using this estimate about 36 tonnes of R50 Dangerous to the Environment and 34 tonnes of Oxidisers were lost, making the incident reportable to Europe. Many of the substances involved are chlorine or bromine based and some are dual classified as both Oxidisers and R50 - Very Toxic to aquatic organisms. As the Top Tier COMAH threshold for both classifications is 200 tonnes the relevant quantity for reporting to the EU under Schedule 7 is 10 tonnes (5%).",
        "Causes of the accident": "Due to the damage caused by the fire it was difficult to determine the precise cause of the fire, but it probably started by decomposition of Calcium Hypochlorite either because of contamination during manufacture and /or during packing on site. The other possibility is the self decomposition during a hot weather event which was contributed to by inadequate ventilation. In addition the pack and over packe design did not facilitate dissipation of heat from the packs of product.",
        "Consequences": "The primary consequence was disruption to the site operations, which closed for at least one day and the warehouse had to be refurbished and only returning to operational use&nbsp;in April 2013. There were no injuries or reported ill health effects from this incident, although&nbsp;a large amount of smoke was generated that drifted off site. Fire water was contained on site and disposed of safely.",
        "Emergency response": "There were no offsite impacts as all fire water was retained and then release to the foul water system with pernission of the water authority. The fire was largely contained within the one warehouse, burt with some smoke and heat damage to adjoining warehouse.The fire activiated the toxic gas alarm, which sounded like an air raid siren and due to noise and early hour kept people in doors.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nThe storage system for the chemicals was not fully compliant with HSG71 'Chemical warehousing'\nThe package design did not allow for the dissipation of heat from the containers of Calcium Hypochlorite in the event of decomposition.\nThe warehouse lacked adequate ventilation to keep the materials cool during hot weather\nNo fire detection system was installed\nCCTV point away from the warehouse, giving no opportunity for the remote security staff to spot an early indication of the fire.\n"

In this scenario, it took only a few minutes for the hard rubber tank situated 10 cm from the immersion heater to catch fire. The absence of full fire separation between the baths and the fact that the ventilation system was on meant that the fire spread quickly to the other baths. What is more, the unit\u2019s staff were in a briefing session when the fire broke out, which is why it was not detected quickly. As the automated system did not have the necessary redundancies, an incorrectly measured liquid level caused it to fail.",
        "Consequences": "The atmospheric measurements carried out (sulphur dioxide) did not reveal any toxicity. The firewater in the retention tank (45 m&sup3;) was pumped out on the evening of the accident and analysed before being sent for treatment by an authorised firm. A soil and vegetation sampling plan was put in place within 5 days to check for possible pollution. No impact was identified. The fire destroyed 200 m&sup2; of the building. The operator estimates the cost of the damage at more than &euro;2 million.",
        "Emergency response": "The operator triggered its internal emergency plan at 12:40 p.m. and the prefect triggered the external emergency plan at 1:14 p.m. because of the potential risk that the large plume of smoke coming from the building was toxic. A nearby school was locked down. The 400 employees at the site were evacuated. The site\u2019s emergency response team protected the nearby equipment while making sure that water was not sprayed into the acid baths. The emergency services put in place a security perimeter and traffic was closed off on a departmental road and on a railway. Given the scale of the accident, the firefighters fought the fire directly on the treatment line baths and put it out at around 2:30 p.m. The 88 pupils and staff at the school were released from lockdown at 2:33 p.m. after an analysis of the air in the schoolyard. The installation affected was made safe and the lockout-tagout procedure was followed.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In order to avoid such accidents, the operator plans to:\n\nMake the detectors more reliable;\nPrioritise alarms;\nSeparate equipment with fire walls;\nAutomatically shut down the ventilation system after a fire has been detected;\nReview the procedure for filling tanks and automatically starting up the heating process;\nMake the fire response strategy in non-pyrotechnic installations more robust.\n"

        "Accident Description": "While a bulk storage tank (Gro\u00dftanklager - GTL) was being filled with a product from a pipeline, the interface (contaminant) between two batches in the pipeline was stored in one tank during normal operation. This led to the tank being filled to 93&nbsp;% and filling was therefore stopped above the level of the overfill warning alarm.The interface is usually stored in three tanks. This is managed from the control room in Cologne-Godorf on the basis of an online, up-to-date fluid level measurement that is continuously monitored by the measuring station at GTL Fl\u00f6rsheim.There are generally two members of staff (dispatchers) at the pipeline measuring station, who can stand in for each other to control the plant, in particular the filling of tanks.\nOwing to the ongoing repair work, since the end of 2014 one tank \u2013 and therefore around one third of the storage capacity for the interface \u2013 has been unavailable.For operational reasons relating to the pipeline, on 3&nbsp;March 2015 the interface was unusually large, so that it was unclear whether the available tank capacity would be sufficient to store the sales product at the expected high standards.\nIn order to test the options for storage in the finished product tank without an adverse impact on quality, the dispatchers fetched the pipeline quality manager while the filling was still underway. Distracted by the discussion, they heard neither warning signals from the system nor a telephone call from the measuring station at Fl\u00f6rsheim and consequently did not act on them.The overfill alarm (changeover point \u2013 tank level measurement) was activated at 14:38:14 and set off acoustic and optical alarms in the pipeline measuring station. Just 36 seconds later, the HHH alarm (independent overfill protection device within the meaning of the VAwS Ordinance on installations handling substances which constitute a hazard to water) was activated, which in turn activated the automatic emergency shutdown of filling by:&nbsp;\n\u2013 closing the quick-closing valve on the pipeline (~6 seconds);\u2013 closing the motor tank valve on the bulk storage tank (~40 seconds);\u2013 shutting down the pipeline pumps by remote control.\nAt the same time, the HH alarm for the tank level measurement was reached and also activated an emergency shutdown by cancelling clearance for filling.The available tank volumes were sufficient to safely prevent the tank from being overfilled. The overfill alarm on the tank cut off the fill signal for the pipeline and thus led to the emergency shutdown of the pipeline pump and the closure of the quick-closing valve on the pipeline. At the same time, the motorised valve on the tank was closed.",
        "Causes of the accident": "\u2013 The unexpected change in the volume of the product grade in the pipeline, which required additional manual action from the dispatcher in charge (operational \u2013 pipeline);\u2013 This in conjunction with a considerably reduced flexibility for action owing to the significantly reduced storage volumes available for the interface as a result of the delayed re-entry into service of the tank (operational);\u2013 The inattention of the two dispatchers (in charge and deputy) as a result of them trying to resolve competing requirements (maintaining quality standards versus available storage volumes) under pressure because of the continuous operation of the pipeline (human error).",
        "Consequences": "- Optimisation of instructions for the pipeline dispatchers and debriefing following the incident.&ndash; Review and adaptation of break points in the fluid level measurements, in order to increase the reaction time for manual action",
        "Emergency response": "No further measures required \u2013 the events described led immediately to a safe situation.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\u2013 Optimisation of instructions for the pipeline dispatchers and debriefing following the incident.\u2013 Review and adaptation of break points in the fluid level measurements, in order to increase the reaction time for manual action between the \u2018changeover alarm\u2019 and emergency shutdown (bulk storage tank).\u2013 Re-entry into service of the bulk storage tank as soon as possible.- Raising the volume of the acoustic alarm (pipeline)."

        "Finish Date": "1990-03-20 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The plant was initially commissioned in 1975 for the manufacture of chlorofluoaniline (CFA) but was also used for manufacturing fluoroaromatic compounds. The whole site contained plants covered by the requirements of Article 5; this specific plant did not however fall under the requirements of Artcile 5. The manufacturer had nevertheless prepared a safety report, which was submitted to the competent Authority at the correct time. This report categorized the process as relatively low risk (the reaction was only mildly exothermic and not very sensitive to small operational variations). The process included the production of difluoronitrobenzene (DFNB) by reacting dichloronitrobenzene (DCNB) with potassium fluoride at a temperature of 165\u00b0C and atmospheric pressure. DFNB was purified by centrifuge and distillation and was subsequently hydrogenated to difluoroaniline (DFA), an intermediate for the pharmaceutical industry. DCNB and DFNB were identified as substances which could decompose violently at temperatures above 220\u00b0C but no circumstances were foreseen which could result in the temperature of the mixture being raised by such a large amount above the normal operating temperature. A few weeks before the accident, the distillation mixture had been contaminated with water through two leaking valves. It was believed that the water had been removed by distillation. During the heating phase the operators realized that the temperature was rising fast, but could do little to control it. The reactor vented, flames were seen to ignite at the top of the reactor and then an explosion occurred, followed by a serious fire. Tank storage of xylene was ignited at an early stage and prolonged the fire.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:The accident occurred as the result of a chain of events. The failure of the two valves and the subsequent gross water contamination were the first critical initiating events. There was an attempt to remove the water using a second distillation on the water/toluene intercut. Failure to remove water may have been due to phase separation of water in the base of the main distillation column. The dimethylacetamide (DMAC) solvent was hydrolized to acetic acid. It was known that DMAC does not easily hydrolyse to acetic acid, but fluoroaromatic compounds acted as catalysts (this catalytic property was not previously known) causing an increased acetic acid production. Acetic acid was accumulate in the DMAC because of the similar boiling points. It is worth noting that the accident occurred when the batch loaded into the reactor was the first one to completely use recycled DMAC following its contamination with water. Laboratory investigations have shown that 2-10% w/w acetic acid in DMAC gives a reproducible rapid exothermic reaction at 140-160\u00b0C, producing a high yield of higher weight molecular substances with evolution of gas (CO2). This lower temperature exothermic reaction drove the temperature up to that which initiated the violent decomposition of the nitrobenzene compounds. Metallurgical examinations indicated that the vessel failed at about 20-25 bar and 500\u00b0C, conditions far above its design pressure and substantially higher than its test pressure. Cooling through both the external jacket and the open vent to a knock-out pot could not cope with the violent decomposition and prevent the pressure build-up in the reactor.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:One operator was on the plant at the time of the explosion. Although he was covered by reactants/products and fell a distance of 6 metres, he suffered nothing worse than a broken leg and was recovered strongly. Unexpectedly, he died 20 days later from post-operative complications. The other 2 plant operators and 3 operators in a nearby control room from an adjacent plant received relatively minor injuries. During the plant demolition, strict controls were used to monitor the workers.MATERIAL LOSS:A large part of the CFA plant was destroyed while nearby plants suffered serious structural damage (missile were thrown uo to 500 metres away). There was little material damage outside the plant complex (broken windows and minor roof damages up to 1.2 km away). The immediate area of the installation was heavily contaminated and slight etching of windscreens and paintwork of a couple of car was caused by hydrogen fluoride precipitation. The plant was subsequently demolished.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The accident broke windows and caused minor roof damages up to 1.2 km away.Ecological harm - Remarks: Though during the fire combustion products were released inair and deposited onto ground, in the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The plant was evacuated. Fire was initially fought by company fire brigade and then by local authority fire brigade (27 pumps and 128 firefighters were activated).No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). The area of the installation was heavily contaminated by fluoroaromatic compounds and the plant was demolished. During the plant demolition, strict controls (including atmospheric sampling and medical supervision [blood and urine tests]) were used to monitor the demolition workers (codes 7701 and 7702).

        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:1- Procedures for assessing the potential for runaway reaction should include guidance on: (a) emphasizing the need for control of the composition of batch process recycles and development of suitable analytical methods; (b) the importance of recognizing potential deviations from standard reaction conditions which might invalidate any presumption that known dangerous conditions could not be achieved;2- the company design parameters for batch reactors should be re-examined to minimize possible pressure build up;3- there should be approved auditing of examination and inspection procedures and the methods of assessment for: (a) mechanical integrity of vessels; (b) control systems;4- future plans for rebuilding this plant are unknown. The future use of DMAC as a Halex solvent is being considered by the company.Measures to mitigate consequences: The area of the installation was heavily contaminated by fluoroaromatic compounds and the plant was demolished. During the plant demolition, strict controls (including atmospheric sampling and medical supervision [blood and urine tests]) were used to monitor the demolition workers.Useful references: The estimated overpressure from the blast damage and their comparison with TNT charges are shown on two tabled attache to the Original Report."

        "Accident Description": "On August 22nd, just after shift handover one of our operators detected a spill of n-heptane into the sewer. The total amount was 20 mton and was caused by a wrong connection of a hose. One of our distillation-columns was in start-up mode. The bottom stream was recirculated over the tank farm back to the feed. The morning of August 22nd, the panel operator instructed one of the operators to change the hose connection to a different line in order to run off to a tank. The operator isolated the circulation, blew the hose empty and disconnected it. He then moved the hose under the manifold and picked it up on the other side to connect it to a different line. From what we now know, he must have picked up another hose and connected the wrong hose to the line and left the hose from the bottom stream of the column on the floor with an open end. He gave the all clear signal to the panel operator to start running off to the tank. He walked the line from that point to the tank and found no leaks. The heptane was in the meantime running off towards the sewer system, which was only detected several hours later. The initial volume increase in the receiving tank is not measured as this has a dead volume of 20m3. When the LOPC was detected, the night shift informed all people on call and a cleaning company was called in to start cleaning the sewer system. The morning of August 23rd we had heavy rain-fall and decided to close the site for all transport and any other work as at several places we saw heptane appearing on the surface.

        "Consequences": " The product was contained in the sewer and waste water system, no emission outside the company.\nRisk for major fire if leak had ignited.Affected Area: Affected Area: installationAffected Area: Affected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "Spill was collected in the sewer and wastewater system and removed from there by a treatment company.\n\nSince there was a heavy rainfall before all product was removed, the heptane floated out of the sewers when these filled with rainwater. This created a dangerous situation throughout the plant. All personnel was forbidden to enter the installation until the spill was removed.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Good management of flexible hoses and open ends is needed.\nProvide fixed connections if possible"

        "Accident Description": "On 2 March 2012, the head of the working team of UAB 'Paslaugos tau' instructed the two repairmen in question to attach a trailer carrying an FKB 1/1 vacuum tank to a T-150 K tractor and wait for the mechanic A.J. from AB 'ORLEN Lietuva', who would explain where to go to load the catalyst and where to drive to unload it. After loading the catalyst into the tank, at around 12.45 they arrived at unit No 3 (Deep Conversion Complex [KT]) to unload it into the B-201 hopper. On the instruction of senior operator R.J., the shift operator G.S. went to hopper B-201 to unload the catalyst. Upon arrival he saw two workers (V.G and A.J.) from the company 'Paslaugos tau' by the tank. They had already connected the air-feed-to-tank hose to the company's technical air system and the catalyst feed hose from the tank to the B-201 hopper. After checking the connections, G.S. unscrewed the technical air feed valve to the tank. After arriving at the tank, where A.J and V.G. were standing, he saw that the manometer read around 3 bar, which they agreed was sufficient pressure. G.S. went to unscrew the bolt to the B-201 hopper. After unscrewing the bolt to the hopper, he noticed that the hose to the catalyst was starting to move. He then turned to look at B-201 hopper and heard an explosion. After the catalyst dust had settled, he turned off the air hose valve and went over to the tractor. There was no tank on the tractor trailer, and A.J and V.G. were lying by B-201 hopper. The technical characteristics table for tank FKB 1/1 (factory number 30242) gives the tank's operating pressure as 0.083 MPa (0.85 bar) to 0.147 MPa (1.5 bar). The technical air pressure fed to the tank was almost 4.2 bar. During the explosion, pressure at the B-201 hopper did not increase. The bolt on the hose at the back of the tank on the catalyst feed to the B-201 hopper was not open.",
        "Causes of the accident": "- inappropriate manipulation of work equipment (tank);\n- inadequate in-house occupational health and safety checks (no checks were carried out on the manipulation of the tank);\n- no standard procedure for the safe unloading of the catalyst from tank to hopper B-201 (technology);\n- failure on the part of the workers to comply with mandatory instructions.\n",
        "Consequences": "Two 'Paslaugos tau' employees died.",
        "Emergency response": "The competent officials from AB 'ORLEN Lietuva' came to the scene of the accident, along with the fire and rescue board for the strategic establishment of the Ma\u017eeiki\u0173, a first-aid team, the police and representatives of the local authorities.",
        "Lesson Learned": "1. when carrying out any technological process (in this case the unloading of a catalyst to a hopper) it is essential to have a procedure for workers to comply with;\n2. installations (work equipment) must not be used for a purpose other than that stipulated by the manufacturer; it is therefore vital to have usage instructions;\n3. where a company does not carry out work itself, but buys in a service from another company, there must be sufficient internal control, both by the company whose workers carry out the work and by the company that commissions the service.\n"

",
        "Causes of the accident": "Causes : Sokalan ( a cross-linked Polyvinylpyrrolidone - PVP) ignited in a heat exchanger due to atmospheric air feed. Approximately 90 minutes elapsed after the change from nitrogen to atmospheric air before Sokalan ignited, due to the fact that the dryer temperature on the cold side of the heat-exchanger was below 160\u00b0C.&nbsp; At low ambient temperatures Sokalan starts oxidising slowly, so that a certain amount of time elapses before ignition.Burning Sokalan was then transported by the gas stream into the dryer. The substance was first redirected&nbsp; by the so-called \" Chinese hat\" collector to the bottom part of the dryer.&nbsp; Up to 40 kg Ludigol (m-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt CAS-Nr.: 127-68-4) dust from the closed loop dryer gas had deposited in that space. The burning sokalan met the ludigol dust&nbsp; inducing it's decomposition. The ludigol fire expanded over the dust layer towards the fluidised bed where another 40-50 kg ludigol decomposed. The fast accelerating uncontrolled decomposition reaction increased the pressure, despite the gas&nbsp; release through the rupture disk, causing the dryer shell to burst at a internal pressure of approximately 1.5 bar.",
        "Consequences": "Onsite material losses: destruction of the dryer, damage by the resulting fire;\noff-site material losses: cars damaged, loss of revenue in the local food industry, exposed fruits and vegetables, cleaning of dwellings.\n",
        "Emergency response": "Protective measures: arrival of the on-site fire brigade and start of fire extinguishing operations.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures  to prevent recurrence: Different substances can be dried in a closed loop gas dryer  only if:\n- possible product residues / deposits cannot cause hazardous conditions or\n- the dryer has to be built in such a manner that  complete cleaning can be guaranteed.\n"

        "Causes of the accident": " line failure due to liquid hammerA shipment of methanol has to be transferred to two storage tanks. When the supply line to the first tank is quickly closed, it is omitted to first open the second tank. This causes a pressure burst in the piping. The weakest point in the piping is the compensator at the first tank. Breakage of the piping at this point causes the outflow of methanol.",
        "Consequences": "No injuries, minor damage to the installation.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "The release took place within the containment of the tank park. The methanol was drained to a sewer pit outside the tank park, and afterwards transferred to vacuum cars.Emergency measures - Remarks: The company fire brigade, the environmental authorities and the police were alerted.Official action taken - legal action: The incident was not immediately reported to the environmental authority, but the following morning. Official report was made for failure to report the incident and for release of dangerous substance.Official action taken - other official action: Corrective actions are taken to prevent recurrence of the incident.Seveso II duties  - remarks: The safety report\ncontains a scenario where release of methanol is followed by ignition.\nTherefore, the actual consequences of this event were less than the\nconsequences described in the scenario.

        "Finish Date": "1995-03-04 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "During chlor-alkali electrolysis an accident occurred in which chlorine was released due to a chlorine-hydrogen explosion: \n\nThe electrolysis of chloro-alkali was performed, as it had been for the previous days, near to the technical capacity. The plant produced 15.6 tonnes chlorine/h and was in normal conditions. There were no evident deviations from the safe operating mode. At the time of the disturbance (accident, failure, breakdown) the shift was manned with a regular crew of 9 persons. The person charged with the control of the measurements was informed by an acoustic signal that a short circuit had occurred in one of the cells. This occurrence is not exceptional and is generally caused by a slight pressure fluctuation in the hydrogen system, which is passed back through the sloping connection between the hydrogen and the chlorine sections. Searching the cause of the increased hydrogen pressure, the controller found immediately out that the hydrogen compressor, which removes all hydrogen from the plant, broke down. He then tried to restart the compressor, which succeeded in the first instance. But short time afterwards, the aggregate broke down again. It is assumed that the low-pressure blocking system caused the break down of the aggregate. The crew observed at that time that a considerable release of hydrogen occurred from the small pipes of the amalgam decomposers. The reason of it is a not sufficient discharge of hydrogen over roof passing through a hydraulic guard foreseen for such cases. This hydraulic guard was set on 70 mm water level and transports the hydrogen without danger over the roof. The container is laid out in accordance with such cases. On the day of the operational disturbance, however, the function of the safety devices was limited (which was not recognized), because a non-irrelevant dirt deposition had formed inside, which increased the counter pressure. Hydrogen reached the cell-space through the mercury pump, which transfers the regenerated mercury again in the electrolytic cell. This fast and massive intrusion of hydrogen caused at least locally the formation of an explosive mixture. The first heavy explosion destroyed a part of the cells as well as the chlorine collection pipe of the new cell-block passing under the explosion point. The plant was shut down by emergency shut down by the crew immediately after the explosion. The after production of hydrogen due to the automatically ongoing decomposition of the amalgam present during that time was not affected by that. Following that, another heavy explosion occurred, which destroyed the externally passing chlorine collection pipe.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Technical error, equipment error (failure of instruments/ accessories).",
        "Consequences": "Three fire fighting officials and one collaborator were slightly injured (affected by irritation of the superior respiratory ducts), after their chlorine gas masks were broken by the power of the explosion. The exposed staff member was also some days under shock. There was also a large material loss.",
        "Emergency response": "The plant was immediately shut down after the explosion by the emergency shut down system.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The aggregate affected was re-designed, avoiding the deposition of dirt (design change). Further, periodic checks are to be performed on it in the future (change in procedure, change in supervision)."

        "Accident Description": "On 3 November 2017 the electroplating plant was started up at 06:23.According to the control system manufacturer\u2019s report of 17 November 2017 on the sequence of events, the temperature in an accelerator bath increased within 12 minutes from room temperature to 58&nbsp;\u00b0C, resulting in an excessive value at 06:44 of approximately 90&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nThe rapid rise in temperature suggests that the container was not filled. It appears that what was measured was the radiant heat of a burning plastic container (usually it takes the bath around eight hours to warm up from room temperature up to 60&nbsp;\u00b0C).However, the control logs show that the accelerator bath was filled.\nIt is unknown why the bath was incorrectly indicated as full. A failure of the redundant level measurement is unlikely.\nAssumptions made by the experts indicate damage to the level probe support during standstill, which could subsequently have led to the level probes being incorrectly positioned (torn off and lying in the tub).\nAt around 06:50, an employee noticed a high flame and smoke in the pre-treatment area. No deflagration or explosion was seen. According to the control centre\u2019s incident log, the fire brigade was alerted at 06:54.\nSafety measures:The temperature-related shutdown appears to have taken place too late (the cause of the fire still needs to be determined by experts). Fire protection devices were triggered and fire-fighting water retention barriers were set. The building was immediately evacuated.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The expert concluded in his report that, on the basis of the available evidence taken as a whole and the connecting factors, it must be assumed that the electroplating machine was unintentionally switched on via the keyboard shortcut F5.\nOnce the machine had been switched on, all the basin heaters were activated. The basin heating system in basin 128 was also activated, even though the rapid increase in temperature indicates that no liquid medium could have been be present in that basin.\nOther basins with heating systems that were also empty of liquid medium were detected and shut down via the safety line, but basin 128 was not.\nIt must therefore be assumed that the level sensors were not at their installed position, so that the system was notified that the liquid medium in basin 128 had a normal filling level, which led the system to switch the heating rods in that basin on.\nIt is thought that the heating systems then probably heated and ignited materials located on the basin floor.",
        "Consequences": "Fire damage, &euro; 10,000,000",
        "Emergency response": "Retention of fire-fighting water and leaked substances in the containment area of the small-scale wastewater treatment plant (SWTP).\n\nDecontamination of the site.\nSealing of the base until final repair.\n\nRemediation plan in accordance with Section 18 of the Federal Soil Protection Act is currently being drawn up.",
        "Lesson Learned": "No use of electric bath heating (not applicable, however, as the electroplating machine will no longer be installed on site)."

        "Accident Description": "On 1/05/2006 at 18:00 a crude oil leak was detected in the bottom part of the shell of the floating roof tank T-3002.Approx. 30.000 m3 of crude oil corresponding to approx. 26.000 t were released into the unpaved&nbsp; retention basin of 130m x 108m = 14.042 m2 and with a equivalent volume capacity as the tank.The characteristics of the released product are: Bashrah type crude oil Physical-chemical characteristics:Density (15\u00b0C) 858 kg/m3Viscosity (20\u00b0C)&nbsp; 11cstFlash point: &lt;21\u00b0CComposition: H2S &lt;&nbsp; 0.001% weightComments: The accident has been classified as major accident in reason of the amount of product released\n &gt;5% quantity for category 08 - extremely flammable\n as defined at point 1 of legislative decree 334/99 and subsequent amendments \n- released amount approx. 26.000 t.\nThe event was triggered by the failure of tank T-3002 in correspondence of the lower  shell part of the same tank.Meteorological conditions - Remarks: the wind caused difficulties inside the retention basinto keep the surface of the spilled oil covered with foam Wind speed: 2.00,&nbsp; Wind direction: Est-Nord-Est, Temperature: 18.00\nDiscussion about Occurrence:At 18:00 hrs on 1/05/2006 alarm was triggered due to smell perception and to the tank level alarm triggered at a variation of &gt;5 cm in the transfer control room; the alarm was caused by a release of crude oil in the storage area south east of the establishment, controls established a relevant leakage of crude oil in the inferior part of the floating roof tank T-3002.The onsite emergency plan specific for the storage area of the installation was triggered. The other production units of the installation did not shut down,&nbsp; because general emergency was not declared, .The tank was insulated from the other systems of the installation by shutting down all electrical systems.The onsite fire brigade intervened, composed by two fire fighters and 1 company's employees (standard composition of the team during week ends) and was promptly integrated by other 8 trained workers.The plant operators provided to transfer of&nbsp; remaining product in the tank T-3002 into tanks T-3001 and T-3004 with fixed pumps. At the same time the onsite fire brigade started to spray foaming agentst inside of the containment basin with&nbsp; the onsite fire extinguishing equipment, such to cover constantly the surface of the still leaking product.At 18:00 hrs the company official in charge as onsite emergency manager&nbsp; informed the provincial command of the fire brigade in Taranto which intervened with own equipment.The transfer of the spilled&nbsp; oil, which was continuosly leaking from the tank,&nbsp; was p\u00e8erformed with of four mobile pumps, and was kept under constant control by the onsite fire brigade and the public fire brigade of Taranto. The public fire brigade of Taranto kept on spraying discontinuously the surface of the released product with foaming agents in order to maintain it constantly covered.Several teams of the public fire brigade intervened until 19:00 hrs of 05/05/2006 when the product released was completely pumped off from the containment basin.The large amount of spilled product caused difficulties in the product transfer process, due to the fact that the release rate of the spilling product was much higher than the capacity the fixed pumps, therefore the level of spilled products was increasing constantly.&nbsp;Maintaining a constant foam level on the spilled product, in order to avoid formation of explosive/flammabnle air/product mixtures, was very difficult due to the fact,&nbsp; that the basin surface was very large and that the leaking liquid was causing a strong turbulence associated with the wind. It was feared that the leaking product could overflow the dams o the containment basin (having an equivalent volume to the damaged tank) due to the amounts of foam sprayed on the crude oil surface.Two road tankers and 8 trailers of high and medium expanding foam were used.The provincial fire brigade intervened with 4 vehicles and 26 men. Vapour concentrations of the spilled oil were continuously monitored on top of the containment basin dam, during the transfer operation of the spilled crude oil&nbsp; The concentration levels determined during the monitoring variated&nbsp; from 4% to 14% of the lower flammability threshold limit.The railway lines Taranto - Bari, Taranto- Metaponto were closed down as a precautionary measure until 5:30 hrs. on 2/05/2006.The state road S.S 106 Ionica was closed and patrolled by police in the tract adjacent to the tank for a shorter period of time.The area affected by the spillage was put under continuous surveillance by the onsite fire fighting team and by the public fire brigade of Taranto. Several teams of the public fire brigade have been intervened until 19:00 hrs on 5/05/2006, when emptying operations of the containment basin terminated.The failure of tank T-3002 has caused the release of approx. 30.000 m3 of crude oil corresponding to approx. 26.000 t.At the date of this report the environmental impact on the soil of the containment basin has been analysed whereas soil&nbsp; remediation measures had were to be taken for the containment basin. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "The release occurred following the formation of a large fissure in the lower part of the tank shell of tank T3002.\nIt has not been excluded that the tank failure may have been caused by a structural failure of the tank base, although an  inspection on the verticality of the tank shell did not show any irregularity.\nThe cause of the tank failure is being investigated.\nThe root causes of the accident, i.e. the causes of the tank failure, as well as the organisational and management causes will be identified only after the internal inspection of the tank.",
        "Consequences": "Release of 26,000 t of crude oil into the unpaved containment basin.\nThe onsite emergency response plan, specific for the tank storage area, was activated, the other units of the refinery maintained normal operation, because a general emergency had not been declared\nAfter the spilled crude oil  had been completely pumped from the containment basin into neighbouring tanks, soil tests showed soil contamination with an average depth of 30 cm  and a maximum depth of 2 m, with a concentration of contaminants above permitted  threshold values .\nAs precautionary measure the train line Taranto - Bari  passing some 80m from the company's premises was closed until 5:30 on 2/05/2006.\nArea concerned - Remarks:The occurrence has involved the tank T_3002 and the containment basin of approx 14.040 m2 surface.The tank is located in a storage park which is physically separated from the refinery's processing installations by the state road SS 106 Jonica.The processing installations were not affected by the occurrence and continued working.The emergency plan specific for the storage, handling and blending department was activated.Soil contamination has affected the area corresponding to the containment basin of tank T-3002.People - Remarks:The accident has caused no victims.The onsite population considered at risk includes exclusively the personnel of the onsite emergency response team and the personnel present in the specific area during the accident. The personnel present onsite during holydays consists in the average in 40 units.Ecological Harm - Remarks:The release of crude oil inside the containment basin has caused soil contamination in the basin. Sample probes have showed principally concentrations of heavy hydrocarbons (C&gt;12) and to an minor extends concentrations of light hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds (C&lt;12) above the contamination threshold limits. At a maximal depth of 2m.The stratigraphy of the soil in the basin has shown that at approx. 3 m depth starts a clay layer reaching 80 m depth (data extracted from the regional geologic map) which has a low permeability isolating thus the deep water bed from the superficial water bed which starts at 2,5 m from the surface.The piezometric probes have shown pollution levels in the superficial water bed above the threshold values defined by law but, according to the statements of the company, these values have not changed significantly with respect to the values encountered in the soil classification performed in 2004.The results of the soil classification have been used in the Environmental and -Health Risk Analysis which was performed and has shown an unacceptable risk at such concentration level and therefore the need of remediation measures. The company is waiting the validation by the Ministry of Environment&nbsp; of the results obtained in the Risk Analysis such to set up a remediation project. Meanwhile, due to the fact that that part of the contaminants in the contaminated soil are washed out by precipitation and thus reach the water shed, a permanent piezometric monitoring system of the water shed through a series of wells placed hydro-geologically upstream and downstream from the tank T-3002. In any case the watershed&nbsp; Remediation project for the entire refinery which has been authorised in 2004 foresaw the construction of a hydraulic barrier in correspondence of tank T-3002, which has been realised. The hydraulic barrier consists in a series of pozzi di emungimento (injection wells) from which the water from the superficial water shed&nbsp; can be pumped for treatment.Material Loss - Remarks:&nbsp;The company had following costs:- Emergency response action (rental of motorised pumps, medium and high expanding&nbsp; foaming agent and other consumables);- Temporary repair of the tank by constructing a retention wall of approx 2 m of steel reinforced concrete in correspondence to the leakage point.- The contaminated soil analysis and the Risk Analysis specific for the occurrenceThe numbers indicated comprise also the estimated cost for:Tank cleaning, opening, repair and retrofitting (installation of a double bottom)Contaminated soil remediation inside the retention basin.Community Disruption - Remarks:The railway lines Taranto - Bari and Taranto- Metaponto which pass respectively at 80 and 165m from the western limit of the retention basin, were closed down as a precautionary measure The state road S.S 106 Ionica was closed and patrolled by police in the tract adjacent to the tank for a shorter period of time.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of:       Ecological component: land (with known potential for long term ecological harm or preventing human access or activities) - Affected Yes",

Therefore the causes of the tank rupture, localized on the bottom section of the tank shell, cannot be determined.\nConcerning the emergency response operation, both the onsite emergency plan and the offsite emergency plan were triggered permitting to avoid the evolution of the event into a worst case scenario.\n\nLong term response\nThe company reserves the right to make any technical, organisational and management changes once the causes of the tank rupture is clearly established, after an internal inspection of the tank is performed, which at the actual state of the works is foreseen for June 2007.\nMeanwhile the company:\n- did not consider it necessary to change the existing tank inspection and control procedures\n- has confirmed that double bottoms will be installed in the tanks according to the program which started in 2004 and is scheduled to end in 2010 \n- The company has been intensifying the control on the work progress in the tank bottom exchange program such to assure the respect of the timing defined.\n- The company has already started official procedures for organising the remediation operations comprising the opening, inspection, repair end refurbishment of the tank (double bottom), and has started the official procedure foreseen in legislative decree  Dlgs 152/2006 which will conclude with the remediation operations of the contaminated soil in the containment basin.\nSeveso II Duties- Remarks:The Regional Technical Committee (CTR)&nbsp; has concluded his evaluation of the safety report 2005 in November 2006, prescribing following actions to be taken:- Installation of remote controls on the pumps and of the root valves of category A tanks (for liquids with flash point &lt;21\u00b0C),- Installation of fixed extinguishing foam sprayers in proximity of containment basins of Category A tanks.- For floating roof tanks installation of redundant breathing valves- Installation of&nbsp; valves at the end of&nbsp; the rainwater drainage pipes in the floating roofs of Category A tanks. The safety report foresaw the catastrophic rupture of a crude oil tank with estimated soil contamination levels&nbsp; higher than those effectively measured after the accident.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: The company had already programmed to install double bottoms in all tanks of category A and tanks for the for the storage of gas oil, in compliance with standard API 650,&nbsp; and the Best Vailable Technology (BAT) of the sector, when the accident occurredThe&nbsp; tank bottom&nbsp; substitution program started in 2004 and is scheduled to terminate in 2010.Following the accident the company has been intensifying the control on the work progress in the tank bottom exchange program such to assure the respect of the timing defined.The company is evaluating the possibility to install double bottoms also in the combustible oil tanks.Moreover following the accident the structural conditions of 29 tanks were tested with acoustic emissions, but also in this case the operation was already planned.The company is waiting to determine the exact causes of the tank shell failure by an internal inspection of the tank, the company has not found elements to request a revision of the&nbsp; existing tank testing procedures.Measures to mitigate consequences: The company reserves right to adopt specific mitigation measures once the exact causes of the accident are determined."

        "Accident Description": "Municipality blocked the drains by using inflatable barriers placed at the outflow. The firefighting water was collected using sludge suction equipments and taken to Kommune-kemi.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Favourable wind and weather conditions.The accident occurred during lunch time and nobody was present. Based on the investigations, it seems that an air/styrene vapours explosive mixture, contained in a small pressure vessel holding gelcoat, was ignited, resulting in an internal overpressure and to the ejection of burning gases through the safety valve. The burning gases partially melted the safety valve and initiated a fire which spread very rapidly over the building. As two storage vessels containing styrene were located in the affected area, a large release of styrene was threatened. This led to a temporary evacuation of the plant and warning of local external population. 60 people were evacuated from their houses located to the south-east of the factory.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nBased on the available information, it has been concluded that an explosive mixture of air/styrene vapours in the pressure pot containing gelcoat (mixture of 60% polyester and 40% styrene) was ignited, probably due to static electricity. The burning gases were released through the safety valve installed on the pot and partially melted the valve itself, initiating a fire which spread very rapidly over the building.\n\nCAUSES:\nWhen the gelcoat should be applied it was pressed out from the pressure pot through a hand operated valve by compressed air. As styrene has a vapour pressure of 6 mbar at 20\u00b0C, a flammable/explosive mixture with air may be expected in the pressure pot during operation but it not was not considered. The liquid gelcoat was in the pot placed in a plastic bucket, providing a possible source of static electricity.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:60 people were evacuated from their houses located to the south-east of the factory. 29 people of the emergency teams were mobilized during the accident. No data are available about the number of the factory's workers involved.MATERIAL LOSS:The production hall was damaged by the fire. The cost of the damages have been evaluated in about 5-6 million DKR (about 0.6-0.75 MECU).Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the fire brigade arrived, first priority was given to the cooling of 2 gelcoat storage vessels inside the building to prevent the release of toxic styrene vapours.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Municipality blocked the drains by using inflatable barriers placed at the outflow. Due to the risk of release of toxic gases, 60 people were temporarily evacuated from their houses located to the south-east of the factory. 29 people of the emergency teams were mobilized.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Due to the heating caused by the fire, the gelcoat in the 2 storage vessels was polymerized and, therefore, cutting of these vessels before transportation to the waste treatment facility was necessary. The cutting operation had to be performed under water jets to avoid the risk of a new fire.MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:After the accident, the following measures were established:1- if solvents, which may form an explosive mixture with pressurized air are being used in the pressure vessel, an inert gas should be used as a propellant;2- all components of the equipment should be properly earthed."

        "Accident Description": "Sludge bulking caused by the growth of filamentous bacteria in the biological treatment plant for industrial effluents at a large chemical site. Organic sludge decanting in the clarifiers was rendered impossible, causing the sludge to overflow into the final physicochemical treatment plant, which rapidly became saturated. Effluent leaving the plant was discharged into the natural environment (first into the river Merle and then into the Rosselle). The water became brown and turbid. The official limits values for SM (suspended matter), COD (chemical oxygen demand) and BOD5 (biological oxygen demand under 5 j) were significantly exceeded at the point of exit from the plant. The potentially affected river Rosselle flows into the Saar in Germany. The German authorities have been informed by the Civil Protection authorities via cross-border procedures. The operator informed the authority for the inspection of classified installations and drew up a press release on 4 August.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The operator is considering several possible explanations for the appearance of filamentous bacteria: accidental destruction of biomass, lack of oxygenation, nutrient deficiency, variation in gross load at the entrance to the plant, adverse climatic conditions (high temperature)",
        "Consequences": "The potentially affected river Rosselle flows into the Saar in Germany. The German authorities have been informed by the Civil Protection authorities via cross-border procedures.",
        "Emergency response": "The following action was taken as soon as the anomaly was discovered: decrease in hydraulic load, testing of alternative flocculents, chlorination then re-inoculation of the plant. Before being discharged into the natural environment, the effluent is treated by large mobile units (filtration and coagulation/flocculation/decanting) starting from the fifth day (operating cost: EUR 0.5 m). Production has been slowed down in several sections on the site until the treatment plants are brought back into operation; one has been stopped, while the operation of two others has been reduced to 30-50%, resulting in high operating losses. Some of the effluent that feeds the biological treatment plant is being kept in storage in order to limit the organic load at the entrance to the plant. Medium-term surveillance of the environment has been put in place in order to assess the impact of the accident (ecotoxicological testing of Daphnia). An unannounced check carried out by the authority for the inspection of classified installations 10 days after the accident found that the effluents discharged into the environment were in compliance with the rules in force.",
        "Lesson Learned": "A study of the water treatment works at the site should eventually be carried out in order to justify their size (closure of several installations, with the result that the water treatment works are oversized)."

        "Causes of the accident": "\u2013 Damage to the inlet shaft went unnoticed.\u2013 Deficient inspection routine. The root causes can be traced to two sources. Firstly, the restructuring following a change of operator when the site was bought in 2003 plays a role. As part of that process, the in-house masonry department, which had until that time carried out inspections and maintenance of the chemical wastewater shafts, was dismantled. There was a lack of awareness of what this step would mean for plant safety or of the need to replace the department. The second main cause was a lack of coordination between the operator and the VAwS expert on regular inspections. The operator was clearly not sure what exactly had to be inspected and to what extent. Moreover, the expert\u2019s notes give little information about the testing activities, the condition of the tested equipment and equipment components and the scope of the tests. The entry \u2018OK\u2019 on testing reports provides little information without further clarification.",
        "Consequences": "Damage to property within the operating area of buildings and sewers as well as contamination of the groundwater.",
        "Emergency response": "\u2013 Immediate end to letting chemical wastewater flow into the drainage system.\u2013 The shaft was emptied.\n\u2013 The chemical wastewater was diverted to other inlets.\u2013 Possible building washout is to be assessed.\u2013 Cleaning of the outlet shaft, review of the building\u2019s structural analysis.\u2013 The contaminated groundwater will be pumped out.\u2013 Expected start week&nbsp;45 of 2015.\u2013 Study commissioned on the degradation of acetonitrile in groundwater.\nModel-based description of the movement of groundwater commissioned from the T\u00fcbingen Groundwater Research Institute (TGF) using the groundwater model from the municipality of Grenzach-Wyhlen based on previous incidents.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Most of the chemical wastewater shafts have now been inspected and the inspections will be completed by the end of 2016; no further leaks have yet been found.In the future, all chemical wastewater shafts will be inspected on an annual basis.The authority is kept constantly informed about inspection activities and results. The lessons that can be learnt from this are:\u2013 A change of operator and associated technical and organisations changes can have a considerable impact on plant safety. Of particular importance are aspects concerning plant integrity (inspection, upkeep and maintenance). The impact on safety may not become apparent for a considerable time. The safety management system must also take into consideration organisational changes. It is recommended that such organisational changes are also taken into consideration by the authorities in conjunction with supervision.\u2013 A lack of coordination of regular inspection and testing measures may lead to incorrect interpretations when assessing the state of the equipment.\u2013 Clear findings with written descriptions and images are therefore required in order to establish the scope and detail of the inspection and the methods used. The inspection report (results) should contain a comprehensible description of the inspection carried out and an expert opinion. In particular, the results of visual inspections should be explained."

        "Accident Description": "Release of Isobutane (iC4) with trace Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) from corroded pipeline on a Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation (HFA) plant. Company has estimated quantity released as 20 tonnes of iC4's and between 60 and 160 Kg of HF. The iC4's were in the vapour phase and are classified as LPG. Release exceeded 5% of qualifying quantity.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The failure was due to internal corrosion of the pipeline. When subsequently inspected the pipeline was also found to have significant internal scale, which in some places completely blocked the line. It appears that approximately 2 years before the incident the line was subjected to a hydrotest using water. It is now thought that the line contained scale from previous operations and this scale became wet as a result of the hydrotest. The drying procedures rely on any water in the system being driven to low points by the circulation of hydrocarbons, where the water is collected and subsequently drained. However this relies on flow through the plant and linework. Since the failed line was on the discharge of a pressure relief valve (PRV), there would be no flow. It is therefore suspected that the line was still wet when taken back into service.The presence of this water, together with the 0.3% Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) in the Isobutane (iC4) process stream, is thought to have caused the accelerated corrosion and scaling.",
        "Consequences": "There were no deaths, injuries, community upset or environmental damage resulting from this incident. However the consequences could have been serious if the flammable gas cloud which resulted, had ignited.",
        "Emergency response": "The incident was dealt with by the company following its own on-site emergency procedures. Although the County fire brigade did attend they were not required. The plant was shut down and depressurised and the Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) transferred to the emergency dump vessel. The release continued for some 84 minutes from the time the gas alarms sounded as the pressure of the plant was reduced. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "The company was well aware that the water concentration in Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) should not exceed 2% weight to limit the corrosion of carbon steel. On recommissioning after the hydrotest, there would have been a relatively high concentration of water in the HF in the line. There is therefore nothing new to be learned with regard to this particular issue. However the company claim that the way the corrosion developed, eventually causing the failure, was unforeseen and therefore there are implications for the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) strategy it employs. The RBI methodology has been reviewed. The company has also had to review the hydrotest and drying procedures. The failed pipeline has been completely replaced and new arrangements provided for the pipeline to be dried at future shutdowns. The investigation included detailed discussions with the company regarding the level of corrosion and scaling. These will continue together with questions concerning the pressure relief arrangements for the plant.  "

        "Accident Description": "The accident occurred at around 8.20 a.m. on 14 January 2016 at the start of the process of filling an IBC with hydrochloric acid in 31-33% solution (fig. 1, enclosed). The accident caused pieces of the container and its protective cage to be projected outwards to a distance of around 20 m. The pieces, and in particular the metal plate on the cage of the container (fig. 2 and 3, enclose), directly hit the worker carrying out the operations, including on the face. The fire brigade arrived at the plant at around 8.37 a.m. Personnel from the emergency medical services (two ambulances), environmental protection services, occupational health and safety services and police also arrived on the scene. The seriously injured worker was airlifted to a hospital intensive care unit. The victim suffered cardiac arrest and died on 15 January 2016.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The operating procedure in place for pouring substances into containers with a capacity of 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;litres or more required a check to be carried out on any incompatibility between the product to be transferred and any residue of the product previously held in the container.In order to ensure that a double check was done, the forklift driver responsible for moving the containers was to select the containers to be filled and provide them to the worker who, after repeating the check, would fill them.In the event that occurred, the required checks were carried out by a single worker whose duties were both forklift operator and warehouse operative (responsible both for moving containers within the plant and, where relevant, filling them). In error, hydrochloric acid began to be poured into a container that had previously held sodium chlorite, with residues estimated at approx. (&gt;=) 1.6 kg still being present.\nIt is believed that the chemical reaction which caused the explosion can be explained by hydrochloric acid mixing with sodium chlorite.The stoichiometry of the reaction between sodium chlorite and hydrochloric acid is as follows: 5NaClO2 + 4HCl -&gt; 4ClO2 + 5NaCl + 2H2O The reaction leads to the formation of ClO2 (chlorine dioxide) which, as indicated on the safety data sheet (SDS Code: 50084, ClorDisys Solutions, Inc.) can give rise, in the gaseous phase, to spontaneous explosive decomposition in concentrations exceeding 10% v/v (low-order explosion). At concentrations greater than or equal to 14% v/v, the decomposition can cause a violent reaction (source: OxyChem Basic Chemicals Technical Service).\nThe initial error allowed interaction between substances whose incompatibility was in fact known and indicated in the procedure. However, issues have come to light that may have contributed to the incorrect operation:\n\nthe procedure in place at the plant envisaged a double check on the container\u2019s label (indicating the substance previously held in it) by the forklift driver when selecting the container to be filled and by the worker filling it; the injured worker may have felt that he had complied with the procedure since, as warehouse operative, he was responsible both for moving the containers within the plant (forklift driver) and for pouring the acid from the tanks into the containers;\nthe plant does not have procedures for organising the yard as regards the management of containers that can be used for pouring operations (particularly concerning those not to be re\u2011used and to be returned to suppliers empty) and, above all, with regard to the incompatibility of substances;\nthe containers are re-used and the check on any residues and their actual nature do not appear to be done.\n",
        "Consequences": "The generation of chlorine dioxide through the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium chlorite and the resulting violent decomposition reaction (low-order explosion), together with the fact that the worker closed the container when he realised that the reaction was happening and that chlorine was thus being produced, led to the explosion and caused the container and its protective metal cage to break apart. The plate on the container&rsquo;s protective metal cage (plate of approx. 50&nbsp;cm x 40&nbsp;cm x 0.2&nbsp;cm used to affix the label, required by the rules, describing the container and its content) was projected outwards by the explosion and hit the worker (who was around 1&nbsp;m from the container) in the face, causing him to die the next day.",
        "Emergency response": "The Internal Emergency Plan was launched following the event. This involved deploying the internal emergency team, calling the fire brigade and emergency medical services and directing the in-house staff not on the emergency team to the assembly point. The emergency team moved the injured worker away from the area affected by the event. The fire brigade arrived at the plant at 8.37 a.m., marked off the area affected by the event and secured the site. They were supported in this by the findings of an environmental check carried out to ascertain whether toxic substances were present. The worker directly affected by the event was airlifted to hospital and operated on. He died the next day.Two other workers who immediately came to their colleague\u2019s aid without appropriate protective devices suffered breathing disturbances, were brought to A&amp;E for the necessary treatment and were signed off sick for two days.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The worker involved in the accident seems not to have properly applied the procedure in place at the plant or perhaps felt he had applied it since, as warehouse operative, he had both the task of moving the containers within the plant and the task of pouring from the tanks into the containers.The company has revised the procedure for filling containers, seemingly strengthening the requirement for checks to be carried out by different people.The empty sodium chlorite container incorrectly filled with hydrochloric acid should not have been present in the area where acid is poured. In fact, sodium chlorite is stored at the plant and on sold on to customers in the same containers in which it arrives at the plant, i.e. without any pouring.The container used in error was present on the vehicle used the previous day by the same worker and not unloaded, together with a second container that had previously been used for hydrochloric acid and which should have used for filling.There is thus also a problem in how the yard is organised as regards the management of containers that can be used for pouring operations (in particular as regards those not to be re-used and to be returned to suppliers empty) and, above all, with regard to the incompatibility of substances.As regards the incompatibility between the substances sold and present in the plant (as indicated in the internal procedure), consideration should also be given to the need to check the containers to be used for pouring operations, e.g. to check:&nbsp;\n\nthe label identifying the substance previously present;\nwhether any residues are present;\nthe actual nature of the residues;\nwhether the container to be used needs to be cleaned.\n"

        "Accident Description": "In a petrochemical plant, 72 t of gas comprising 80% ethylene and 20% ethane were released into the air at a rate of 60 kg/hr from 27/02/07 to 17/04/07, representing 5% of the site's annual VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions.A production operator making his round discovered the leak on 27/02/07 on the vent hole of the cold box housing the ethylene/ethylene exchanger (insulated by pearlite) of the steam-cracking unit. This vent hole located at a height of 15 m evacuates the inerting nitrogen of the cold box, which functions between -40 and -50 \u00b0C under 8 to 11 bar. To avoid any risk of ignition or explosion, the operator has installed 4 gas detectors, constantly measured the internal pressure of the box, monitored the development of leaks by video camera with a feed to the control room, increased the vent hole from 1\" to 3\" after installing an elbow on it to divert the leak from the installation, which was then connected to a mobile flare and put into service on17. 04. Water and steam curtain systems and fire monitors were pre-positioned in case of a major leak. Automatic shut-off valves were installed to rapidly isolate the section concerned and the work permits procedure was modified to take into account the deteriorated the situation.Since the leak did not increase over time, thereby confirming the metallurgical analysis, and in view of the safety and surveillance measures taken, the facility remained in service for a limited period in order to prepare the on-site repair of the exchanger. The facility finally shut down for one month on 28/05/07.Notification of the accident is justified by the fact that the ethylene and ethane released correspond respectively to 115% and 29% of the Seveso thresholds for substances.This accident corresponds to level 5 of the European accident scale for hazardous materials, by releasing 100% in excess of the relevant Seveso threshold.",

        "Accident Description": "From 2 to 4 October 2006 repairs were carried out at omissis nafta of the KR\u2011601/2 furnace in section 001 of the KT-1/1 combined\ntechnological device for deep processing of fuel oil; these works consisted of\nreplacing the three worn out sections of the heating spiral in the radiation\npart of the furnace. After completing the works at 8:00 in the morning of 12\nOctober 2006 the work was begun on starting up the KR-601/2 furnace. The\nburners were ignited in the KR\u2011601/2 furnace, the temperature was raised and\nthe furnace heating spirals were filled with fuel oil, which began feeding into\nthe K-601 column at 9:28 of the same day. Prior to connecting KR\u2011601/2 to the\nsystem, the raw material was fed into the K-601 column by heating it in the KR-601/1\nreserve furnace. The technological parameters of the KR-601/1 furnace and K\u2011601\ncolumn were within the allowed limits. The KR-601/2 furnace was connected to the system by\ngradually raising the temperature of the raw material supplied to the column.\nAccording to the technical regulation of the vacuum fuel oil rectification and tar\nvisbreaking section 001 of the combined technological device KT-1/1 for deep\nprocessing of fuel oil, the temperature of the supplied raw material needs to\nbe raised by 30 to 35\u00b0C per hour. It is apparent from the analysis of the diagrams\nof technological parameters that from 12:55 to 14:24 the temperature of the raw\nmaterial being supplied was rising by 38 to 45\u00b0C per hour, meaning that the\nlimits specified in the technical regulation were being exceeded. Certain other divergences from the technological regime can\nbe seen from the diagrams of the parameters of the technological regime: - at 9:32 and at 9:48 the vacuum pressure in the column\ndecreased to 104.435 mm Hg st. and 67.018 mm Hg st. respectively (usually the vacuum\npressure in the column is about 20 mm Hg st.); - from 13:37 the level of tar started decreasing sharply at\nthe bottom of the K\u2011601 column, and at 14:24 the measuring devices could not\nregister it at all. According to the technical regulation, the level of tar at\nthe bottom of the column must remain within the limits of 40 to 90%; - from 14:00 to 14:23 the pressure of the cleavage gas in\nseparators SP-603/1 and SP-603/2 started increasing sharply (from 0.53 bar. to\n-0.335 bar.); - from 10:55 to 12:25 the total amount of raw material being\nfed into the K-601 column was about 544 m3/h. At 13:55 the amount of the raw\nmaterial being supplied decreased to 447\u00a0m3/h. The debit was increased,\nand at 14:25 the amount of the raw material being fed into the column was 520\nm3/h. At 14:30 the supply of the raw material into the column stopped\ncompletely . - At 14:24 there was a complete absence of vacuum pressure\nin the K-601 column; - At 14:30 the S-608 pump stopped pumping and was operating\nan empty cycle. The Communication Point of the Operative Management Section\nof the Fire Rescue Service of omissis received the fire alarm from\nthe K-601 column at 14:32 after the fire safety alarm was set in bases Nos 6\nand 7 of section 001. The firefighters on duty in team 1 of the omissis Fire Safety Service were the first to begin extinguishing the fire in section\n001, using fire rescue truck PA-40(131)137. The remaining firefighters in team 1\nand team 2 were immediately sent to site of the fire. When the first of those\nteams arrived at the site at 14:36 the column and an area covering 200 sq.m. at\nthe bottom of the column were alight. When the column collapsed at 14:54 the\nfire spread across an area of 800 sq. m.",
        "Causes of the accident": " The commission found during the investigation that, according\nto the drawing contained in the technical passport of the K-601 column, the 150\nmm long junction pipe at the bottom of the column ends with a coupling junction,\nhowever, the junction pipe is actually mounted by connecting it to the technological\npipeline No\u00a0619/1 with a welded connection. These technical modifications\nare not shown in the drawings of the technical passport of the K-601 column. It\nwas found during the investigation that the design solution to replace the coupling\njunction with a connection by welding was adopted and approved in 1987. On the\nbasis of the same solution, the steal containing 5% Cr and 0.5% Mo (steal type\naccording to GOST 5520-79), as foreseen in the initial project for the\nproduction from the 426 x 10 pipe of the elements of the technological pipeline\nNo\u00a0619/1 connected to the junction pipe of the K\u2011601 column, was replaced\nby carbonic construction steal 22K, according to GOST 5520-79. According to the\nglobally recognised methods against corrosion, if the technological product\nsulphur content exceeds 0.5% and the product temperature exceeds 260 0C, corrosion\nand heat-proof metal must be used (as was foreseen in the initial project). As\nthe technological product sulphur content of the K-601 column and the product\ntemperature highly exceeds the values referred above (2.6% and 625 0C\naccordingly), it can be stated that the replacement of the type of steal was an\ninadequate solution that resulted in the corrosion of the pipeline\nNo\u00a0619/1. This is confirmed by tests carried out during the investigation,\naccording to which, the metal of the wall of the separated pipe in the pipeline\nNo\u00a0619/1, between the parts of the vacuum column and the separation valve,\nis affected by inter\u2011crystal corrosion and bottom layer erosion (corrosion).\nThe investigated parts of the technological pipeline No\u00a0619/1 were\naffected by erosion (corrosion) at the time of operation and up to the moment\nof fire. It is likely that the thinning of different walls of the pipe was\npredicated by erosion (corrosion) before the fire. The thickness of the wall in\nsome places was only 0.15 mm. It was found during the investigation that, at the moment when\nthe fire was detected and during the extinguishing of the initial fire, it was the\nbottom part of the K-601 column, located in the intermediary area of the\npedestal of the K-601 column and between feedwater heaters of the column and\nsection 001 of the KT 1/1 technological device that was on fire. According to the opinion of the investigating commission,\nthe most likely reason for the fire in the section 001 of the KT 1/1 combined\ntechnological device for deep processing of fuel oil is the ignition of the\ntechnological product (tar), previously heated to the self\u2011incineration\ntemperature, after this product burst out through the crack (or cracks) in the\npart affected by corrosion of the technological pipeline No 619/1 between the\njunction pipe of the K-601 column and the separating valve. Such cracks may\nhave resulted from the thinning of the wall in the part of the said pipeline to\nthe level that it was not able to resist the pressure load. It results from the analysis of the technical regulation of\nthe vacuum fuel oil rectification and tar visbreaking 001 section of the\ncombined technological device KT-1/1 for deep processing of fuel oil, that the\nactions of the technological staff faced with changes in technological\nparameters (tar level at the bottom of the K-601 column (the cube) or vacuum\nlevel inside the column K-601) and their technological management are not\nstrictly regulated and the technological staff operating the device acts on the\nbasis of instructions from their directors or based on their own personal\nexperience. At the time of the accident the staff operating the device notices\nany change in technological parameters (decrease of the tar level at the bottom\nof the column and sudden decrease of vacuum in the column itself) attempted to\nrestore the parameters, by regulating the column load and the tar debit from\nthe bottom of the column, but at that time the product was already coming\nthrough the possible place of dehermetisation in the part of the technological\npipeline No\u00a0619/1 between the K-601 column junction pipe and the\nseparating valve. It has almost been an hour (from 13:37 to 14:30) that no one\nof the operating personnel passed through the K-601 column and inspected it or\nthe related equipment, in order to identify the reasons for the decreased tar\nlevel in the cube of the K-601 column. On 15 October 2004 the management plans approved by the\nchairperson of the board of omissis provided for the reduction of\noperating costs, by extending the intervals between general repairs by at least\n4 years and more, and, at the same time, for the improvement of the long-term\nreliability of devices. According to the commission, this decision fails to\nimprove the long-term reliability of devices, as the repairs of separate\ndevices, without stopping the production for general repairs, cannot allow the\nfull taking into account of the wear and tear of the devices and their\ncondition. The last general repairs at omissis were carried out in\n2003, and the repairs planned for 2006 were postponed. The manufacturer set a service period of 11 years for the\nK-601 vacuum column (technical passport of the device, page 129, Table 2\n\u201cTechnical characteristics\u201d). The inner condition of the K-601 column was\ninspected on 26 September 1997 together with hydraulic tests. Based on the\ninspection and test results, also the investigations performed and conclusions\npresented by the joint stock omissis, omissis decided\nto extend the period of operation of the column (the fact recorded in the\ntechnical passport of the K-601 column). The last inspection of the inner and outer condition of the\nK-601 column was performed on 9 January 2006 (the fact recorded in the\ntechnical passport of the K-601 column). According to the requirements of the\nInstructions No\u00a0BM-2 for using pressure vessels, the next date for the\ninner and outer inspection of the column was set to 9 January 2010, i.e. the\nplanned frequency of the inspections was 4 years. Acting on the basis of the Instruction for the use of\npressure pipelines No\u00a0BM-4, approved Order No\u00a083 of the deputy\ndirector for production technology and capital integration of omissis\nof 23 April 2004, the pipeline maintenance engineer of the Diagnostic Facility\nperforms the technical inspections of the pressure pipeline No619/1 (from the K-601\ncolumn to the pumps S-608, S-613/1, S-613/2). The last inspection of the operating\npipeline No\u00a0619/1 (hereinafter referred to as IOP) and the full\nverification of its technical condition (hereinafter referred to as VTC) was\nperformed on 15 December 2004. The inspection found some minor shortcomings,\nhowever, it concluded that the repairs of the pipeline were not necessary, and\nthe next inspection dates were set accordingly at 15 December 2008 for IOP and\n15 December 2010 for VTC (the fact recorded in the technical passport of the\nK-601 column).",
        "Consequences": " The samples of ambient air in omissis, omissis and omissis\nvillages were taken and their residents were inquired. Based on the results of inspection of ambient air, the\nconcentration of chemicals found (nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide) did not\nexceed the single limit values allowed by omissis Hygiene Standard HN\n35:2002 \u201cLimit Values of Polluting Substances in the Ambient Air of Residential\nAreas\u201d. None of the employees of omissis or residents of\nthe surrounding areas addressed to omissis hospital reception due to health\nproblems related to the fire at omissis. Neither the ambulance of omissisi had any calls related to this accident. Having regard to the information available, no objective\nfacts demonstrating the consequences to public health of the fire at omissis were found. Having received all the required documentation and\ncalculations from omissis, the officers of the State Environmental\nProtection Inspectorate and omissis Regional Environmental Protection\nDepartment inspected the place of the accident and the related communications\nand performed the required measurements and laboratory tests. After collecting all the available data it was found that it\nwas only the ambient air that suffered damage, after the pollutants fled into\nthe atmosphere in the result of fire. It was found that 9.13 t of different oil\nproducts burned during the fire at omissis and the resulting damage\nto the environment amounted to omissis 68\u00a0864.66 (equivalent approx. to 19900 Euro). Omissis suffered material damage of omissis 530\n748 (equivalent approx. to 153700 Euro), i.e. the assets of the corresponding value that no longer fit for purpose\nwere written off the accounting. ",
        "Emergency response": "30 fire rescue cars and 82 state fire rescue service\nofficers from omissis, omissis and omissis county Fire Safety Services\nparticipated in the elimination of the accident and 17\u00a0pressure guns were\nused to extinguish the fire.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In order to avoid similar accidents in future, the following\nrecommendations were given: 1. It is necessary to supplement the technological\nregulations, by foreseeing particular (defined) actions of the staff and\nnecessary measures to be taken in the event of change in technological\nparameters and disruption of technological processes. 2. The control of evaluation of technical condition of\npipelines, detection of shortcomings and violations, regulation of application\nof diagnostic measures and methods, elimination of defects and violations and\nprocedures for carrying out repairs was strengthened. 3. In order to ensure safe operation of technological\nequipment for oil processing, prepare studies for the risk analysis of possible\naccidents at omissis, clarify accident elimination plans and the\nsafety report. 4. In order to ensure safe operation of technological\ndevices for oil processing, cover the supporting metal constructions of\nanalogous devices with fire-proof material. 5. The time between repairs of devices may only be prolonged\nafter modernising the device or strengthening the testing and inspection system. 6. Install video monitoring systems of dangerous equipment.

Their job was to wash, absolutize the equipment in accordance with the Cleaning Instruction, before the start of amino-camphor HCl production.There were already technical failures before the absolutization step, which were repaired.In early hours of 3rd December after repairing the failures washing toluene was filled from autoclave R-230 via pump SZ-243 into the inertized, self-discharging centrifugal machine FI-231.During the dismounting of pneumatic pipeline air entered into the centrifugal machine.The closed - originally inert - system became opened for a short period and this changed the properties of inert state inside the drum of centrifugal machine which rotated with unchanged speed. As the technician assembled the dismounted pipeline the air-space with changed concentration was closed in the centrifugal machine.The inertization system was launched while the system became open, i. e. nitrogen entered into the centrifugal machine, until the centrifugal machine did not reached the closed status and the pressure reached the value of 8-14 mbar.After this the centrifugal machine was operated without load for about 1 hour, while the nitrogen feed which assures the overpressure activated presumably several times.During this step at 5:12 explosion happened inside of the centrifugal machine, and thereafter fire started around the centrifugal machine.There is no evidence for source of ignition, but the ignition of explosive gas mixture was probably caused by electrostatic discharge.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Oxygen entered into the - originally inertized - centrifugal machine, because of technological failure.Based on the fire-analyses it can be stated that the accident occurred because of technical failure. The closed - originally inert - system became opened for a short period and this changed the properties of inert state inside the drum of centrifugal machine which rotated with unchanged speed.There is no evidence for source of ignition, but the ignition of explosive gas mixture was probably caused by electrostatic discharge.",
        "Consequences": "Area concerned: The accident didn't escalate outside of the establishment.People - remarks: The worker injured in the accident died in burning casualties on the 2nd day after transported to the hospital. Other human was not affected.Material Loss:The plant suffered material damages. There were production loss. Estimated at 1 Million Euros.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "Emergency measures - Remarks: The fire-alarm center got alarmed as the accident happened, after this, the person present in the center alarmed the company fire brigade, the on-site action coordinating person (dispatcher), the security service and the electrical duty-office. In 3-4 minutes the squad-leader informed the local fire-station and also the county emergency directorate. The competent managers of the company were ordered in. The plant firemen rescued the casualty (5:17), localized the fire, and then extinguished. The local firemen arrived at site (5:30) helped in post-accident activity. The seriously injured worker was brought to central medical ambulance and from there to county hospital. Meanwhile the informed leaders of authorities arrived. The fire-fighting was finished by 6:20. The reconstruction of the installation was finished by 22. 09. 2003.Seveso II duties - remarks: By the time of accident the safety analysis of the plant was not prepared. The amended government decree of 2/2001 stated 1st April 2003 as deadline for sending in the safety analyses, thus the plant could fulfill the SEVESO II obligations and undertakings only in part.Discussion about the response:At 5:15 on 3rd December 2002 fire-alarm came from the plant, which was confirmed also by phone. The firemen went to site immediately with all of the fire-extinguishing equipments. 4 person and the safety officer on duty went to the site.Fire was seen in room for weighing dangerous material.Exploring the sit they observed one person in fire. The reinforced glass wall beside the door has been broken by the firemen. The person in fire stepped out.The officer on duty and the workers helped the casualty to get into the car and in transport. At 5:20 the staff was ordered to assemble one fire-extinguisher powder-gusher and extinguish the fire of unknown material, which went out by using the powder-gusher. Meanwhile the firemen noticed that there is fire around the toluene-tank.They experienced that the equipment were in fire, heavy, black smoke coming through the door. The staff was ordered to replace the powder-gusher. While the replace of powder-gusher was not ready they started to extinguish the fire with 50 kg dry chemical extinguisher placed near to the room. The fire went out, but we saw leak on top of the equipment and on two places behind o fit, which reinflamed in short time. By that time the replacement of powder-gusher was done and we shot the powder. After this the fire went out, and then 2-3 times reinflamed and liquid material was leaking further to the top of the equipment and behind the equipment. Because of this in about one minute after extinguishing the fire there was a larger reinflame of fire, but it was also extinguished with powder-gusher, but because of these inflammations the electrical lines under the ceiling on cable-ladder were in flame and the fire spread in direction of control room. By this time I ordered to replace the powder-gusher to the other entrance and we tried to get a reinflaming fire under. By this time arrived the department leader. After consulting with him beside applying the powder-gusher, they ordered to assemble a water-gusher, because they got by this time the putting out declaration of electrical office on duty. After this the electrical cable and minor reinflames were extinguished by water-gusher. The gusher had to be replaced to direction of control room, because the fire spread on cable to that direction. Meanwhile the fire-protection leader arrived, who ordered a worker and/or a fireman to install a generator-lighting to the entrance near to control room. Further this door was used for extinguishing the cable fire. Two firemen started to explore the upper floor, with help of firemen, who arrived by that time. Because of high temperature and heavy smoke the orientation was not easy, but they did not experienced fire in the upper floor, only in the right lower part of the computer room. For extinguishing of this fire a new gusher was assembled, in which the firemen helped. The fire went out in minutes, later the focus went to cooling the equipment, and/or in upper floor, furthermore in ground floor the drying external door and the transit door in front of the fire were opened.Later we got request to cool the centrifugal machine and the equipment above, which was requested by the division leader.",
        "Lesson Learned": "There was no action in operational field. The technology has been modified, instead of centrifugal machine, filter-dryer has been put into operation.\nMeasures to prevent recurrence:&nbsp; Following measures were ordered in the plant in connection with the incident on 3rd December 2002. In every case, the deadlines and responsible persons were determined.1. Pneumatic pipelines:- By installing new pneumatic systems the standard color marking for pipelines has to be applied.- In case of existing systems - where via the pneumatic pipelines both compressed air and nitrogen are used - the pipelines for nitrogen has to be changed for yellow color.2. The nitrogen flushing of the space between liquid phase outlet and liquid seal - which is \"dead space\" in regard of inertization - has to be solved.3. The exchange of&nbsp;flexible pipes to rigid ones - ensuring the gas-tight function between the centrifugal machines and centrifugal wagon, applying solid material sealing and the coupling assuring the gas-tight state by mechanical way has to be considered. If it is not possible, then supply of inflatable tubes shall be provided by nitrogen. 4. The exchange of filtering centrifugal machine FI-231 and applying other type of filtering equipment."

        "Accident Description": "At about 8:45 am on August 5, 2009, when a tank truck loaded with 30t liquid ammonia from a chemical plant was unloading liquid ammonia, a metal soft tube suddenly ruptured, causing the leakage of liquid ammonia. As of 10:00 am on August 7, the liquid ammonia leakage incident had caused 21 persons to be hospitalized for treatment, of whom 3 were seriously hurt but not critically; 88 persons had irritating reactions and were observed at clinics; and 137 left hospital and returned home after being cured. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "According to the preliminary police investigation, there were three causes for the incident:\n-First, the unloading metal tube of the liquid ammonia tank truck had quality problems. According to the site observation, the surface of the metal tube had aged and was seriously worn, and there were bulges on some of its surface;\n-Second, the emergency cut-off valve of the tank failed to work. After liquid ammonia leaked, the tank truck driver immediately went to the rear of the tank to shut the emergency cut-off valve, but the valve failed to work and did not cut off the leakage source in time; and\n-Third, the tank truck was overloaded. Its approved load was 24.3 t, but its actual load reached about 30t.\nageing\n",
        "Consequences": "The liquid ammonia leakage incident had caused 21 persons to be hospitalized for treatment, of whom 3 were seriously hurt but not critically; 88 persons had irritating reactions and were observed at clinics; and 137 left hospital and returned home after being cured. ",
        "Emergency response": "While corporate company responded to the incident by itself, it also quickly reported the incident to Annex 1 Eight Selected Chemical Accident Reports from China the local government and police. At 9:10 am, after receiving the incident report, the government of Hongshan District immediately started the contingency plan, and leaders of municipal and district governments and related departments hurried to the incident site to command emergency response efforts. Local police closed off and controlled the incident site. The local firefighters used water to cool and dilute the leaking liquid ammonia to reduce the volatilization of ammonia. At 9:10 am, safety supervision personnel arrived at the site, immediately co-working with the firefighters to evacuate the people at the accident site and photographing the site to obtain evidence. At about 10:15 am, the rescue workers shut the valve of the tank; around 10:20 am, the leakage source was completely cut off. About 1 hour and 30 minutes later, the on-site emergency response was basically completed. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "MAHB findings:\nThe metal tube had bad quality and it was aged. The company should have management procedures, regular inspections to identify and tackle ageing. Furthermore, inspection programme in place to check the quality of the pieces of equipment. The emergency cut off valve failed to work properly and therefore overload occurred. Secondary/additional safety barriers and written safety procedures should be in place to prevent overloading and being able to stop overloading of truck.\n"

        "Accident Title": "Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) leak at foam production plant",
        "Start Date": "2012-08-13 12:43:00",
        "Finish Date": "2012-08-13 06:45:00",
        "Accident Description": "At approximately 07:00 in the foam production area, a TDI pipeline (in the cooling system) connected to a heat exchanger (plate-fin heat exchanger) was opened.\nAfter the circuit had been running for approximately 15 minutes, a pressure relief valve was activated and fluid (cooling water) was released.\nThe TDI circuit pump was shut down and the TDI pipeline to the heat exchanger was closed off. Initial troubleshooting by staff. From approx. 08:30 supported by specialist firm which carried out the installation. The cause was identified as using the wrong pipelines. When the heat exchanger was fitted the product inlet (TDI) and the cooling water outlet from the heat exchanger were mixed up.\nThis resulted in a short-circuit between the coolant (ethylene glycol/water) and the product (TDI). At that point it was not apparent that coolant had entered the TDI tank. It was not possible to foresee the subsequent effects of this. At approx. 11:30 the operating crew noticed that steam was coming out of the tank storage facility. They then inspected the tank storage facility and found that the steam was coming out of one TDI tank and that the tank had a raised temperature.\nThe production management then immediately informed the company management. In addition, the production manager at a subsidiary site and the European Isocyanate Producers Association (ISOPA) emergency call centre were contacted for advice.\nThe steam generation in the tank section of the storage hall had now become stronger and the temperature and pressure in the tank continued to rise. It could also be seen that material (liquid and foam) and steam were being released from the tank as gas escaped.\nSince it could no longer be ruled out that gas could also be released outside the tank storage building, at approx. 12:43 the operating crew called the public fire service.\nAt approx. 13:00 the first members of the public fire service, police and rescue service arrived at the site. The public fire service was assisted by two works fire brigade units on site.\nAt approx. 13:15 the competent authorities and the appointed external accident coordinator were also informed by the company management.\nSide by side with the emergency services deployed at the accident site, an emergency and crisis management team was set up in the administration building on 13 August 2013 for internal risk protection and emergency management. The team was made up of company operations managers, the accident coordinator, external emergency services and representatives of the authorities. Since the TDI contents of the damaged tank continued to display an exothermic reaction and thermal instability, to reduce the heat of the reaction the tank and the entire TDI tank storage building were permanently kept under a water curtain by the emergency services. Following the installation of various additional temperature-measuring devices, the reaction in the damaged tank could be measured and monitored, inside the tank and on its outer wall continuously by the emergency services in a safe room.\nThe TDI tank affected had a double wall, which meant that the water curtain had only a small heat-dissipating effect. As described, the tank had to be cooled for several days by spraying (water curtain). Following the provisional all-clear on 16 August 2012, on 17 August 2012 the temperature rose again significantly, possibly as a result of the reduced spraying. The situation did not stabilise until 18/19 August 2012 as a result of the sustained cooling. To be safe, the public emergency response services continued cooling by spraying (water curtain) until it was clear from the temperature readings that the reaction had stopped. The investigation and clean-up work could then begin. The damaged TDI tank was inspected by specially trained fire service staff and other experts at the end of August 2013. The purpose of the inspection was to obtain a better assessment of the residual risk for salvaging the damaged tank and as a result determine the subsequent recovery procedure.\nFollowing a thorough examination, by agreement with the company operations managers, the local emergency services and representatives of the authorities, the tank and its remaining contents were disposed of safely with the aid of a specialised firm in September 2013 using a special industrial cleaning method (suction method). At the same time the expert appointed by the investigating authority began investigating the cause in accordance with \u00a7 29a BImSchG (Federal Immission Control Act).",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause is human error (repair work):\nPreparatory work for starting up a TDI cooling water system by staff (13 August 2012) following conversion work. When a plate-fin heat exchanger was fitted, the pipelines were mixed up. start up\nAs a result, on start-up water was able to enter a raw material tank. The ingress of water (heat transfer medium in the heat exchanger: ethylene glycol/water mixture) triggered a chemical reaction, leading to an increase in temperature and pressure in the affected tank.",
        "Consequences": "- Damage to tank,\n- Contaminated TDI, approximately 20 t. Cost: EUR 100 000",
        "Emergency response": "At approx. 07:00 the inlet and return valves of the production pipeline were opened and the TDI circulated (preparatory work for starting up the TDI cooling water system).\nAt approx. 07:15 the pressure relief valve in the cooling water circuit activates. Cooling water is allowed to drain.\nFrom approx. 07:15 staff look for fault.\nFrom approx. 08:30 support from outside firm. Cause of fault: mix-up in pipelines. Water ingress into TDI tank not apparent.\nAt approx. 11:30 steam generated in TDI store. Operating crew check TDI store. Company management informed immediately. Production manager at a subsidiary site and the ISOPA emergency call centre contacted for advice.\nAt approx. 12:43 emergency call to fire service because increased steam generation visible.\nAt approx. 13:00 first emergency service staff arrive on site. Emergency service staff immediately take the appropriate safety measures: water curtain outside (building), tank, i.e. tank walls, cooled from outside (also by spraying), danger areas sealed off, public alerted by police loudspeaker messages, radio announcements (\u2018Please stay indoors and keep doors and windows closed\u2019).\nAt approx. 13:15 competent authorities and appointed external accident coordinator informed by company management. - The company (workshop management) made an emergency call to the fire brigade,\n- Members of staff at the plant were evacuated in accordance with the emergency plan and proceeded to the assembly point,\n- Fire brigade and other emergency services (police) attended the scene,\n- Emergency services set up a water curtain (building),\n- Tank, i.e. tank walls, cooled from outside (also by spraying), - Danger areas sealed off,\n- Local residents alerted by police loudspeaker messages, radio announcements,\n- Nearby facilities at plant secured (building and separation/decoupling of nearby components (equipment/pipelines),\n- Immediate notification sent to competent authority, - Information sheet produced and distributed to local residents,\n- Measurements (atmospheric measurements) taken by fire brigade,\n- Network of approximately 25 technical experts and consultants set up on-site in order to develop essential safety measures further (including additional cooling of damaged tank, tank recovery, securing neighbouring components, official information, etc.).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Technical measures:\n- Measuring and control equipment: to protect employees in the event of an incident a large number of measuring and control devices were installed, e.g. pressure monitors, temperature monitors, overfill protectors, filling level monitors, water monitors, TDI sensors, etc.\n- Marking of TDI pipelines and storage tanks: all TDI pipelines and storage tanks were colour-coded. The suction and pressure lines on TDI pumps were marked in different colours. Signs were also put up with the substance names and flow direction.\n- Installation of a TDI monitor which gives an acoustic and optical alarm on site if a limit value of 0.5 ppb is exceeded.\n- Reduction of the TDI storage capacity.\n- Replacement of the traditional heat exchanger with a safety heat exchanger. This ensures that no coolant comes into contact with TDI or enters the TDI circuit, and that no TDI enters the cooling circuit. Organisational measures:\n- Setting up of an emergency service (alarm system sends text message to mobile phone).\n- Review of the plant alarm and contingency plan and introduction of a local incident commander.\n- Review of operating instructions, such as conduct in the event of an alarm in the TDI part of the plant, operating instructions for the organisation of the emergency service, goods-in checks and unloading TDI tankers, operating instructions for the TDI monitors, instructions for outside firms.\n- Review of and training in the \u2018work permit\u2019 procedure: for work involving particular risks, such as working at height, working with hazardous substances, etc. a work permit must be issued and all the necessary data documented.\n- Review of the inspection and maintenance plan: drawing up an inspection register with all routine inspections. As a precautionary measure to limit the effect of incidents, a number of technical and organisational measures were laid down and implemented. Other measures included adding a systematic incident assessment to the safety report. A total of three incident assessments were drawn up.\nThe incident assessments will be routinely reviewed."

The night guardian passed a check-point behind storage tank No 31 at 04:00 am and did not notice anything abnormal. At 04:00 am 2 employees arrived in the office company (it is situated about 250 m from the parking lot for lorries). A few minutes after their arrival 5 valves on the tanks' bottom were activated including tanks No 30 and 31. At 04:10, a driver from the parking lot passed by the office to warn about a petrol smelling mist on the parking place. The two employees check this phenomenon (moving around in car!) first at the parking place and then inside the establishment. At 04:20 the 2 men observed a mist whiter than fog at the east counterfort of the tank No 22 and inside the retention basin of tanks No 30 and 31. None of the other retention basins contained any mist. The mist entered the parking lot passing under the counterfort separating the retention basin from the parking lot. The mist covered the whole parking area and was just about reaching the road. At 04:20 am a violent explosion happened originating from the parking place and propagating towards the storage area. The two employees were thrown in the retention basin by the shock wave, but managed to return to the office and close the automatic valves. The emergency services arrived on-site at 04:38 am. The police blocked the access to the roads around the storage facility, and the railway traffic was interrupted. The tanks caught fire at 04:50 am. The fire was extinguished at 12.17. A more detailed accident case history description is shown on Annex No 1 attached to the Original Report.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nA leakage (source unknown) of unleaded petrol formed aerosol (estimated volume about 25,000 m3) that was ignited by a lorry, parked but with motor running.

The fire probably developed in an ancient ink processing tower, which was scheduled for substitution.This accident is classified at level 3 of the international accident gravity scale due to the material damage, which was estimated in 9.000.000 (nine million) Euros, although the establishment itself is not classified as a Seveso establishment.",
        "Causes of the accident": "According to the operator, an employee was dosing a non standard mixture using a 25 l metallic bucket without earthing the bucket. An electrical discharge may have ignited the solvent vapours, the fire then spread rapidly to the processing tower and to the other containers; the vapours released over the relief valves of the containers accelerated the propagation of the fire.",

The production was shut down, the 7 employees present in the work-shop were evacuated, then all the personnel left the establishment. The fire brigade reached the accident place 10 minutes after being automatically alerted over a direct line (TALIA system - Alarm Terminal for the Identification of Accident sources) and arrived well equipped. The fire was brought under control at 5:30 and completely extinguished at 9:30. The site was put under surveillance during the following 5 days. The installation was not equipped with an adequate retention pond; during the time needed to install containment systems the extinguishing water drained in a channel for one hour before being confined into the site storm-water system (150 m3). At 8:30 h some external companies pumped the extinguishing water into storm-water ponds (municipality, Infrastructure and Development Department) in which the extinguishing water was kept for several hours, the water gates of the storm-water ponds proved not to be waterproof. Shortly after the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) observed a pollution of the river Matz. The polluted effluents were in the end evacuated by road tankers for disposal.",

        "Finish Date": "2018-07-23 07:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "At around 9.00 a.m. black smoke from the flares of the steam cracker unit was observed. At 1.50 p.m. flames were seen coming from a flue. Two distinct events were taking place: a loss of steam supply throughout the platform and a fire in a furnace of the steam cracker unit.\n&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "A general loss of electric power, followed by a loss of backup power, cut the steam supply to the platform and, in particular, to the steam cracker unit, consequently causing flaring. The steam supply was re-established at around 5.30 p.m., but it was not enough to end the flaring, as several boilers remained idle. The operator\u2019s strategy of steam load shedding consisted in cutting the steam supply first to the flares, which was necessary to improve combustion, and then to the production units. Flaring was finally reduced by restarting the production installations and starting up the secondary boilers.\nThe loss of electric power was caused by defects in junction boxes between two sections of thick buried cables. An expert is examining those boxes to determine the causes of the defects.\nThe fire in the furnace of the steam cracker unit started when the tubes where the hydrocarbons circulate broke and fell to the bottom of the furnace. It would seem that the hydrocarbons then caught fire. The loss of steam shut down the furnace suddenly, which in turn led to thermal chock and damage to the tubes.\n&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "A total of 1,440 t of hydrocarbons were flared over a period of two days.\n&nbsp;",
        "Emergency response": "The operator launched its internal emergency plan at 2.30 p.m. As a preventive measure, the police blocked traffic on the D110 road, which runs next to the site. The internal emergency services and firefighters set up a command post to monitor the situation. The operator cut the hydrocarbon supply to the steam cracker furnace, which gradually lowered the intensity of the fire.&nbsp;The installations downstream of the furnace were purged with nitrogen, the fire was controlled and the furnace made safe at about 3.00 a.m. the following morning. In order to offset the loss of steam, the site operator restarted the boilers at around 5.30 p.m. The prefecture and the operator issued a joint press release at around 6.00 p.m. The internal emergency plan was lifted the following morning at 7.30 a.m. By restarting the boilers it was possible to reduce flaring, but black smoke was visible until the following day.\n&nbsp;",
        "Lesson Learned": "The operator suggested the following improvements:\n\nReviewing its steam load shedding strategy in order to limit emissions into the air from the flares;\nEvaluating the functioning of the steam cracker in case of loss of steam.\n"

The accident is notified due to its relevance concerning lessons to be learned: risks related to ammonium nitrates and emergency response related measures.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The ammonium nitrates stored could be the cause of the accident starting. The 2 gas bottles cannot be by themselves the  cause of the accident. The explosion of a light-bulb as releasing factor of the fire was hypothesiseded (light switch found in ON position).",
        "Consequences": "Twenty-three persons including 18 fire-fighters were injured. Nine fire-fighters were seriously injured and three fire-fighters were injured very seriously and were still hospitalised after 18 days. Windows were broken in the village up to several hundred meters distance. Roofs and cars were damaged within a radius of 800 m. The fire propagated after the explosion emitting a big black smoke-cloud.",
        "Emergency response": "The emergency-response plan was released at maximum-alert level (red). Several dozen emergency response vehicles, 4 helicopters, a team with rescue dogs, an advanced medical post and 150 fire-fighters for support were sent out. The fire was brought under control at about 20:30 hrs. 94 inhabitants were evacuated and a security perimeter of 300 to 400 m diameter and a security service were set up and maintained all night. A psychological support unit, which was set up from October 3, was consulted by more than a hundred people. Approximately 60 inhabitants were allowed to return to their homes after 4 days. A judicial investigation was carried out. The security and monitoring service was disbanded by the police 11 days after the explosion.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Ammonium nitrates could be the cause of the explosion. In addition to the compliance with regulations for the storage of this kind of products several organisms (professional trade unions, insurances..) publish recommendations concerning the storage of these products for establishments not subject to the Seveso Directive. The presence of these substances has to be known and taken into account in case of an emergency response action. The communication problems which were reported were also due to the absence of coverage by the mobile phone network."

        "Accident Description": "At May 19, during the night, an Ethylene Oxide ( EO) railcar was discharged. This situation only occurs during shortage of EO , e.g. during turnaround phases. Normally railcars are not discharged, but loaded, however the most of the EO is used internally. Prior to the unloading, a cooling unit in the storage area was taken out of production for cleaning and was re-commissioned. This operation included isolating this unit by means of \u2018blinds\u2019. After applying startup procedures the operator started the discharge operation. Such operations for safety reasons are exclusively carried out during night shifts. Initially a small batch for quality assessment was discharged into a dedicated tank without any problem. Shortly before the incident, the transport line was rechecked by the operator, valve settings were adjusted to facilitate transfer to the main spherical storage tank. Upon commencing transfer, the operator encountered problems generating a sufficient flow from the pump. Several re- checks of ( valve, pressure etc.) settings and lineups, and confirmations were carried out. After restart attempts, and increasing (nitrogen) vapour pressure in the railcar, an apparently normal pressure gradient and fluid flow was monitored. Sometime later, EO gas alarm was triggered, that shortly thereafter ceased an next was interpreted as a \u2018false peak alarm\u2019. Shortly after shift switch, the EO transfer operation was halted as a normal safety precaution. The day shift crew in the daylight discovered signs of EO leakage underneath a manifold, and discovered a blind flange that had not been discovered during the night. This obviously alerted senior management, and soon it was concluded that the entire transferred volume ( 32,5 tons) had found its way into cooling water discharge point via a Pressure Relief Valve. Immediately, the local emergency team was established and started the impact assessment. Simultaneously, local authorities as well as the AKZO Nobel Corporate Emergency response team were alerted, and a independent investigation of the incident by corporate and independent experts with support of the Board of Management was initiated. Important to mention is:",
        "Causes of the accident": "The following conclusions are drawn up on account of the investigation: Operating error plus incomplete application of Management of ChangeCombination of an operating error (leaving a blind flange in place) plus an incomplete application of a Management of Change procedure (maximum allowable operating pressure not in line with the pressure relief valve settings) led to over pressurization of the EO transport system. As a consequence EO material found its way through the relief valve into the cooling water system and finally to sea water. Cleaning the EO Cooler was executed not following a work permit nor was it planned and controlled in the strict turnaround regime.Isolating the cooler in the EO transport system by own personnel for cleaning, remained outside the turnaround (plant maintenance stop) work scope and did not trigger inclusion of these activities into the strict turnaround control routine, nor was it included in a work permit routine. Work permits are issued only for contractors working on the installations. This was one of the causes that contributed to the error in the blind flange procedure. Informal shift handover at operator level and deviation from standard operating procedures.Coordination and handover of activities to be carried out by different operators is informal and the assessment and response to operational deviations is largely delegated to operators, with no stringent requirements to involve line management. This was one of the main causes that contributed to applying higher than normal pressures on the system and not discovering the fact that an additional blind that was put in the system.",
        "Consequences": "The potential consequence of the main event is in this case EO toxification (poisoning) of surface water. Ethylene Oxide is toxic to microorganisms and fish. The LC50 value for fish is 84 mg/l (exposure time 96 hrs.) However, in free flowing water the EO concentration decreases continually due to a combination of evaporation, hydrolysis and biodegradation, as is underpinned by a diagram showing the EO concentration pattern in the affected Asker\u00f6fjorden.",

The investigation team would like to stress that these observations are of great value, because they could influence a wide area of the organisation. During the investigation the following observations have been made.\u00a0 During the investigation the team observed room for improvement in the field of housekeeping,\u00a0 Examples being:\u00a0 Absence of signage, welcoming documents and related instructions in the reception area in other than Swedish (i.e. in English)\u00a0 A reasonable level of tidiness in the reception building with unfixed repairs waiting\u00a0 In the plant:\u00a0 Missing valve tags, obstacles on the plant floor that could/should have been removed previously, tools/instruments, hoses and other obstacles in installation landings\u00a0 From a series of incidents including the subject one in Stenungsund it appears that alarm architecture and \u2013management is an ongoing dilemma.\u00a0 It would be worthwhile considering a review of Control Room Alarm Architecture comparing critical process conditions -as derived from risk analysis with the way the same conditions are presented in a(ny) control room in a distinctly differing format from status (change) information. Without such distinction, alarms threaten to become \u2018information noise\u2019 between (hundreds of) status notifications."

        "Causes of the accident": "The source of the discharge was the flushing out of effluent from the incineration unit for chlorinated residues (which also contained bromine).\nThe incinerator was processing chlorinated waste from Spain when the incident occurred. Investigations showed that the bromine content of the waste was up to four times more than the incinerator usually handled. The incinerator flue-gases underwent wet treatment.",
        "Consequences": "Tests confirmed high levels of chlorates alongside high levels of bromates at a chemical production site.",
        "Emergency response": "On 22 March, the municipality ordered water use restrictions and distributed bottles of water to residents.\nDischarges from the electrolysis workshop were diverted to the emergency tanks.\nOn 31 March, the prefect issued an emergency order banning discharges from incineration units and requiring monitoring of the daily readings at water intake stations and in the environment. On 3 April, the measurements taken on the company\u2019s discharges were all below the detection threshold.\nUntil the situation at the water intake station permanently improved, the operator put in place an ultrafiltration unit to supply drinking water. The operator also installed a mobile osmosis treatment station to treat the 10,000&nbsp;m\u00b3 of polluted water stored in the containment tanks.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The specifications of external waste processed must be looked at closely in terms of how the incineration flue-gases are treated."

        "Accident Description": "SAFETY SYSTEMS OR OPERATORS INTERVENTION:The gate to the storehouse was closed at 14:00. Nothing unusual was observed. The last time the storage room of FAS was visited before the accident was in the morning of Friday, 11th of October.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Wind direction North-East. Wind speed = about 5 m/s.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:On Friday, 11th of October 1991 at 14:15, about 22.7 tonnes of formamidine sulfinic acid (FAS) decomposed almost instantaneously producing a thick white fog of sulphur dioxide and a solid residue. The sulphur dioxide cloud disappeared at approximately 16:15. An open fire did not developed. The maximum temperature reached during the decomposition has not been very high because the wooden pallets on which the FAS big- bags were stored were not burnt or discoloured.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The initiating event is not fully known. A smell in the warehouse was felt for some time prior to the accident. FAS decomposed to Sulphur dioxide escaping the building. The solid residue flowed out of the building.CAUSES:The likely cause was storage mistakes, which caused chemical reactions between the stored chemicals. These reactions were exothermic and initiated the fast decomposition of FAS. The exothermic reactions took probably place between the bags of FAS and the bags of alkaline soap. Alkaline dust from sodium carbonate, which was sprinkled on the floor to give a driving support for trucks, may also have been involved in the reaction, and condensed water may have been accelerated the reactions. The storage of FAS in two layers may have accelerated the rate of decomposition, as it reduced the heat&nbsp; transfer from the bags.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:12 people inside and 19 outside the establishment were injured by the release of sulphur dioxide. All of them were hospitalized.MATERIAL LOSS:No material losses occurred except the decomposed product (about 22.7 tonnes of FAS) and other chemicals that were damaged. The cost of the lost products has been evaluated in about 1 million DKR (about 0.12 MECU).ECOLOGICAL HARM:Sulphur dioxide was released from Maglemoelle Papirfabrik into the neighbourhood, a part of the town Naestved. The residue (melted FAS, sulphur, urea and other decomposition products) flowed into the harbour. The local environmental authority observed the harbour on the day of the accident and two days later. As the water in the harbour was rapidly diluted via the channel, no disturbances in acquatic life was observed.&nbsp;MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:On a map attached to the Original Report is shown the area which was alarmed by the police.Disruption of community life: The sulphur dioxide cloud escaped from the storage room and was released from Maglemoelle Papirfabrik into the neighbourhood, a part of the town Naestved (19 people people outside the establishment were hospitalized). The residue of the FAS decomposition flowed into the harbour. The area which was alarmed by the police is shown on a map attached to the Original Report.Material loss - Establishment losses - material max euro: 133000Material loss - Establishment losses - material max local: 1000000Material loss - Local currency: DKRAffected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire brigade (14 people) assisted by the civil defense (16 people) stopped the decomposition of FAS by overflowing the product with plenty of water. The residue of the FAS decomposition flowed into the harbour.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The area involved by the sulphur dioxide cloud was alarmed by the police. The local environmental authority observed the harbour on the day of the accident and two days later. As the water in the harbour was rapidly diluted via the channel, no disturbances in aquatic life were observed.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:After the accident, the conditions for FAS storage have been changed and the following measures were established:1- improvement of the quality of the big-bags used for FAS (watertight and stronger, in such a way to reduce the possibility of damages during transport);2- separate clean storage room for FAS;3- storage of FAS in one layer only and separation of bags to ensure good heat transfer.MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE ACCIDENT:After the accident, it was established to install a redundant monitoring system (operating in continuous) for sulphur dioxide concentrations connected to an alarm system in Maglemoelle Papirfabrik and Naestved Fire Brigade and to a sprinkler system."

In the incident, a storm caused damage to the weather protection film on a substrate store, which is fastened to a gas storage membrane to provide protection from outside weather conditions.\nThe gas storage membrane remained intact. No people were injured and no damage was caused to the environment. However, approximately EUR 25 000 of property damage was caused.",
        "Causes of the accident": "In the light of meteorological data and images of the damage sustained, it is assumed that the incident was caused by the prevailing weather conditions on 30 June 2012. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm this for certain. According to current information, the weather conditions were a significant cause of the damage sustained.",
        "Consequences": "Damage to weather protection film and replacement of damaged film. The damaged film was replaced by the film manufacturer and the entire roof was checked for damage. There is no possibility that gas may have leaked.\n",
        "Emergency response": "Once damage had been caused to the weather protection film, it was immediately secured to avoid further damage being caused and protection was arranged for the gas storage membrane. The damaged film has already been replaced by the manufacturer and the gas storage membrane checked for damage. After the damage occurred, precautions were immediately taken to protect the weather protection film from further damage. This prevented the film from becoming detached and the loose film from causing subsequent damage. Following the storm, the weather protection film was fully removed from the substrate store and placed to the side of the plant to protect it from further damage.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "The risk of damage being caused to the weather protection film is unavoidable. However, the second layer (gas membrane) makes the possibility of a biogas leak unlikely. No further precautions are envisaged. The roof which was installed is state of the art. "

In this case the accident is classified at level 3 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive applying the criteria on amounts of substances (1% to 10% of the upper threshold).Considering the peculiarity of this kind of storage and the relevance of the event it has been classified as \"other event\".",
        "Causes of the accident": "Following investigation a gas leakage was found on a (DN50) dead-end line connected to a DN150 branch and part of the purging circuit which had been partially dismantled in 1987. The gas probably reached the electrical appliance room via cable conduits. It is not known precisely how long the pipe had been leaking: the leakage may have started quite a long time before the accident. ",
        "Consequences": "Financial and material damage was limited: a building showed cracks, cables and control cabinets had to be tested, a cast iron lid of a venting chamber was blown several meters away.\n\n",
        "Emergency response": "Emergency shutdown systems and the alarm were released. A security perimeter was set up on-site and all activities were shutdown.The piping system involved in the accident, buried 3m underground, was isolated and purged. Inspection of the piping was complicated by the fact that the leaking gas had iced the ground for 2.5 m around the pipe; the operation was concluded after 2 days.The Classified Installation Inspectorate suggested issuing&nbsp; a prefectural order making&nbsp;&nbsp; the presentation of a complete accident investigation report and the documentation of the repair work a condition for resuming activities. The Inspectorate further requested an action plan for the treatment of embrittlement points like the one found on the sector involved in the accident, the installation of gas detection systems in all places not already equipped and in all cable channels. The operator is to substitute the pipe sector concerned and remove the dead-end line section. A study is to be performed on the caption of the other wells: dismantling of dead-end lines on old piping, corrosion diagnostics on the other ones.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures for improving the gas tightness of electric appliance rooms are being put in place.  The studies may lead to the installation of a servo system shutting down the electrical supply in case of gas detection. The leakage in the piping may also have been caused by a metallurgical default: complementary investigations have been started."

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nThe operation of the plant was organized in two shifts. Since the hydrogenation at Reactor 6 would have taken at least 30 hours, it was not possible to complete the reaction during a single shift. The reaction was commenced at 8:00 a.m. on the day of the accident and, at 11:50 p.m., the shift chemical operator closed down the system as follows:\n- he shut off the hydrogen addition at the reactor and closed the valve at the hydrogen cylinder bank;\n- the reactor's agitator was turned off and the reactor was left isolated with an hydrogen atmosphere over the liquid.\nNo nitrogen inerting was used. The operator checked the reactor's control panel which showed normal operating temperature and pressure. The operator was also in control of Reactor 5 which he shut down in a similar manner. At approximately midnight, as the chemical operators were changing in their locker room, they heard a loud explosion coming from the process area. As they evacuated the building, they observed a fire around Reactor 6. The area sprinkler system was automatically activated and quenched the fire. It was noticed that one operator was missing. He came to the assembly point a few minutes later and said that when the explosion occurred he was trapped in the mill room weighing finished product. He could not exit by the process area and had to exit through a hatch on the floor, jump onto a rotary dryer below and climb down to the ground floor. A second explosion occurred a few minutes later. A fire with a characteristic black smoke resulted, indicative of a solvent fire. The sprinkler system extinguished this fire. A short while later, the fire services arrived and put out small localized fires on the ground floor around Reactor 6. The building was left vacant for the rest of the night.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nAn analysis of the Reactor 6 contents showed that approximately 400 litres of the total contents (about 1200 litres) remained inside the vessel. A quality control analysis of this material showed that the reaction was progressing satisfactorily before the incident. Examinations have shown that combustion should be supported inside the reactor as nitrous oxide was generated in the process. An electrostatic discharge could have caused the first explosion but this was considered unlikely on investigation. The most probable cause of the incident was a defective agitator. The maintenance record on the agitator showed that it malfunctioned on numerous occasions  but the maintenance was not sufficient. It was felt that the agitator possibly malfunctioned again allowing a hydrogen leak. As the reactor was located in a general process area with plants operating nearby, the released hydrogen could easily have found an ignition source as some of the electrical plants operating nearby were not suitable for use with hydrogen. The investigation showed that the reactor's pressure relief line did not operate as the bursting disc was found to be intact.\n",
        "Consequences": "MATERIAL LOSS:The extent of the damage caused by the explosion and the following fires was as follows: the reactor was badly distorted; the valve on the underside of Reactor 6 was also distorted and leaked; the sightglass in the manlid was shattered; the agitator was blown from its seating and deposited a few metres away; the glass fittings on Reactors 5 and 7 were shattered; electric cable insulation was charred and paintwork on the walls, ceilings and nearby millroom doors was scorched as far as 15 metres away; the glass in the windows on the first floor was shattered and the window frames distorted next to Reactors 5 and 7; windows up to 30 metres were blown out. The costs of the damage has been estimated at about 0.4M Euros.People - Remarks: No people were injured by the explosion because, when the accident occurred, the operators were changing in their locker room except for an operator that was trapped in the mill room weighing finished product. He could not exit by the process area and had to exit through a hatch on the floor, jump onto a rotary dryer below and climb down to the ground floor.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The process building was evacuated. The fires were extinguished by the automatically activated sprinkler system. The Fire services (15 fire fighters) arrived a short while later and put out small localized fires on the ground floor around Reactor 6.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:No off-site emergency measures were necessary.No emergency measures are still necessary, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After this accident, the following measures were established:\n1- to carry out hydrogenation in a separate dedicated process area with electrical equipment suitable for use with hydrogen;\n2- to provide adequate alarms to warn when a hydrogen leak could occur.\n\nThe Company was also required to:\n3- implement a more extensive preventive maintenance system;\n4- install appropriate pressure relief devices to ensure that emissions do not vent into the process area;\n5- review procedures to ensure that processes which have to be left unattended overnight are left in a safe state;6- provide nitrogen purging in any reactor containing highly flammable solvents which have to be left unattended overnight."

        "Finish Date": "2016-09-06 20:31:00",
        "Accident Description": "On 6 September 2016 an automatic system opened safety valves (\u2018bleeders\u2019) at a blast furnace at around 20:27 for a period of approximately 4 minutes. The bleeders are located on a 86&nbsp;m platform and are the safety devices provided for in the blast furnace as described in the Partial Safety Report, which prevent and safely release an unacceptable overpressure in the blast furnace. This measure resulted in an emission perceptible from outside the factory (discharge of dusty blast furnace gas with audible flow noise).\nSafety measure:Due to an as yet unidentified error within the redundant programmable memory controller (SPS) of the pressure measurement in the blast furnace\u2019s risers, there was a fault in the process control system, which resulted in a system reset for pressure measurements being carried out in the measurement system. The previous fault had reduced the counter-pressure on the blast furnace to around 1 bar. The set point was 2.4 bar. As a result of this very large system deviation, the annular scrubber units in the gas purification process slammed shut. As a result, pressure built up in the upper furnace and the built-in safety features were triggered in the correct order:\n\nThe Snort Valve opened several times to reduce wind pressure.\nThe first bleeder opened when a pressure of approximately 3.1 bar was reached.\nThe opening of the bleeder released the furnace pressure safely into the atmosphere as expected.\nThe triggering of this safety system eliminates a serious risk for staff and local residents. When the bleeders closed at 20.31, the furnace pressure was again in the controlled range and the system was again in normal condition.\n\nThe safety system in place functioned correctly and without errors.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The pressure build-up in the blast furnace gas system and the response of the PCE monitoring device were caused by the failure of both logic modules of the redundant programmable memory controller. According to the manufacturer\u2019s investigations, the cause of failure lies in errors in the internal address of the logic modules.&nbsp;\nThe reason for failure is, in the expert\u2019s view, accidental errors.",
        "Consequences": "External impacts: Audible flow noise for four minutes and soiling (of cars) causing &euro;500 in damage.Audible flow noise for four minutes.",
        "Emergency response": "\nThe on-site fire brigade and relevant on-call teams were informed;\nIssue of a D2 message by the on-site fire brigade, downgraded to D1 after a short period of time;\nPress release;\nImmediate report by telephone to the local government.\n\nThe soiling caused by falling dust was subsequently dealt with.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In particular, in comparable situations in future, the existing back-up system will be used until the SPS becomes available again after a restart. This has already been achieved by implementing an automatic switch to the back-up controller (with appropriate visualisation) in the event of an error in the standard system as an ad hoc measure.&nbsp;\nDuring planned standstills in summer 2017, two additional pressure transmitters will be installed on the blast furnace gas risers. Their analogue readings will then be transmitted directly to the back-up controller as a 4-20 mA signal. The back-pressure can thus be controlled by the back-up controller independently of the SPS on the basis of separate measurements of the pressure in the risers.\nThe analogue data signals from the four existing pressure transmitters on the risers will also be routed via four independent isolation amplifiers in order to decouple the signals."

It was used in an air separation plant and for many years had only been used occasionally as a back up to the turbo compressor during peak load. The piston compressor had been switched on the previous day at 7.45 pm. It had therefore been on for approximately 16 hours at the time of accident. &nbsp;At 11.48 am strong vibrations were first observed, directly followed by an explosion at the compressor with a secondary fire. The machine shop was damaged as a result of the shock wave, projected parts, molten material, heat and fume condensation. There was no personal injury.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Compression of O2 from 150 mbar to 18 bar\n Temperature: inflow: 20 \u00b0C, discharge: 90-100 \u00b0CCause description:\nThe incident began inside the cylinder on stage 3 (most heavily used) most likely via the piston in the top  compression space. This is clear from the damage: dismantling of the system confirmed the first impression.\nA metal fire must then have developed inside which spread by exploding outwards having melted the top wall of the cylinder. The fire was then apparently further fed by the oxygen flowing back out of the pipes until the stop valve of the pipe system was closed manually. There was evidence that the piston in stage 3 had jammed (piston rod twisted). It is likely that this seizure was a result of the primary cause, i.e. the piston got stuck and the piston rod was twisted as a result of the continued running (or trail ) of the machine.\nThe presumed cause is that parts inside the compressor broke up or off and then gathered on the piston. These broken parts were then beaten against the cover of the compressor compartment and consequently became warped, or alternatively got into the gap between the piston and the cylinder liner (also possible for parts bigger than the width of the gap around the valve opening) and were ground there. Both of these processes produce friction heat which ignited the fire.\n\n",

        "Causes of the accident": "How the fire started is unknown. The most probable cause is chemical heating. The fire fighting installation did not function effectively. After smoke detection, the automatic fire extinguisher was activated. During the filling of the hall with foam, it was discovered that some ventilation hatches were still open. Two of three hatches were kicked shut, but then the increasing amount of foam prevented further action. Consequently the hall was filled with foam and automatically refilled whenever the foam level dropped. Refilling continued from 05.16 until 05.57, then the installation ran out of foam. New supplies arrived too late, around 08.00. At this point the foam level had probably dropped to a level allowing oxygen to come into contact with the smouldering waste. The fire brigade had to wait for the automatic system to extinguish the fire. When it became apparent that this did not happen, they could not enter the hall. They were forced to wait with extinguishing the fire until the walls and/or roof collapsed.",
        "Consequences": "The incident caused material loss. Toxic combustion products were formed.The smoke of the fire covered a large area west of Drachten. At first it was feared that the smoke contained a lot of toxic substances. Therefor the Ministry of Agriculture took precautionary measures. The concentration of toxic materials in the water, soil and grass was measured. Milk from cows in the area was destroyed.People - Remarks:39 employees of ATF were examined to detect possible adverse effects on their health. The overall conclusion of the examination was favourable. Some employees reported irritation of the airway one day after the fire. Social life was influenced to some extent, due to overwork. Biometric tests did not show abnormalities due to exposure to toxic substances. One of the companies involved in the clean-up operation also had its employees examined. No adverse effects on health were registered. Furthermore, monitoring of levels of toxic substances in the area around the site (both air and soil) showed that no one was exposed to significant levels of dioxins during or after the fire.Material Loss - Remarks:The farmers affected by the preventive measures receive a total of 500,000 Euros for compensation of their expenses and losses.Discussion about consequences:Initial testing indicated elevated levels of lead and cadmium up till 4 kilometres from the fire. At a distance of 300 metres the cadmium levels in the grass exceeded about ten times the allowed maximum levels for cattle-fodder. In the week after the fire grass and milk samples were taken again to examine the nature, concentration levels and possible risks of the combustion products that were released during the fire. The results of this investigation may be summarized as follows:|\u00b7 As a result of the preventive measures taken, no elevated levels of heavy metals, PCB's and dioxins were expected in milk from the area. Measurements on milk samples collected on May 13, 14 and 15 confirmed these assumptions.|\u00b7 Grass samples taken in the area 1.5 till 30 kilometres from the fire showed no elevated levels of PCB's, dioxin-like substances or heavy metals.|\u00b7 Elevated levels of dioxin were found only in grass at distances less than 1500 metres from the fire.|\u00b7 At one of the 49 measure sites, at a distance of 1 kilometre from the fire, elevated levels of vanadium, chrome, arsene, cadmium, mercury and lead were measured in the grass. The allowed maximum level in cattle-fodder was exceeded only for lead on this site. No other samples in the area 0,5 till 30 kilometres from the fire showed excess of the allowed maximum levels for heavy metals in cattle-fodder.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "On-site systems: not known yet. External services: firebrigade was active controlling the fire. Ministry of Agriculture took precautionary measures. The concentration of toxic materials in the water, soil and grass was measured. Milk from cows in the area was destroyed.Emergency measures - Remarks: The Ministry of Health advised against the consumption of products grown in gardens or vegetable gardens within a distance of 1.5 kilometres from the fire. The Ministry of Agriculture ordered restrictive measures for farms in the vicinity (up to a distance of 30 kilometres from the fire). Cattle were put into the stable, grass was not used as cattle-fodder and milk was collected separately. A few days later, tests showed that only grass samples within a distance of 1.5 kilometres from the fire were contaminated. Milk samples were not contaminated. The preventive measures concerning milk were therefore lifted. The preventive measures concerning cattle and grass were lifted except for farms in the 1.5 kilometres zone. For those farms, the preventive measures were only lifted after the grass had been mowed and destroyed. Concerning the on-site clean-up operation: An estimate of 3400 m3 fire-water (mixed with sewage) was transported to a disposal facility. Several areas on the property of ATF De Pijp were contaminated due to firewater run-off and cleaning operations. 691.460 tonnes of contaminated soil were excavated and transported to a disposal facility.Official action taken - legal action: Penal investigationOfficial action taken - other official action: see 1d. Furthermore the permit for operating the installation was partially withdrawn. To resume the company's activities an adapted working procedure has been drawn up. This working procedure is based on daily removal of waste materials. Local authorities also ordered a screening for toxic substances of objects in the vicinity of the site.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures&nbsp; to mitigate consequences: The depot was equipped with an automatic hi-ex firefighting system with inside air. After smoke detection the foam fire extinguisher was activated. This has presumably prevented the fire from spreading for several hours, but has not led to complete extinguishing of the fire. The extinguisher installation did not work flawlessly. Part of the foam was lost through open hatches at the bottom of the depot. However, there are no indications that this significantly reduced the effectiveness of the installation. Therefore the effectiveness of the hi-ex foam extinguisher, whether or not equipped with inside air, in extinguishing fires in chemical depots must be questioned. The Committee Prevention of Disasters (CPR), which recommends the use of this particular fire fighting system in its guideline CPR 15, has ordered further investigation into this subject."

        "Accident Description": "The accident occurred at the PENDIMETHALIN (active principle for the selective herbicide) production plant. The process comprises 4 steps:Step 1 - mononitrationStep 2 - reductive alkylation of 4-nitroxyleneStep 3 - dinitration of the intermediateStep 4 - purification and washing of the Pendimethalin.The accident occurred during step 3 in the nitric acid concentration section and involved the distillation column C320 and the dedicated reboiler E320, connected to the column by natural circulation.The cause of the accident is still under investigation by the competent judicial authorities; however, based on the declarations of the company, it can be supposed that the event initiated with the bursting of the bottom of the distillation column and the reboiler connected to the same column. The blast wave consequent to the explosion hurled one of the two road tankers parked nearby on a second road tanker. The road tanker hurled by the blast wave contained nitric acid with a ca. 40% concentration, resulting from the purging of the column bottom, whereas the road tanker which was hit was empty. The projection of missiles on the plant structures consequent to the explosion caused among other consequences, also cracks on the tank containing nitric acid and its release. A fire developed also affecting only the immediate surroundings of the explosion within a radius of a few metres, according to an estimate based on the effects left by the flames. According to the estimates of the company, the smoke column produced by the fire reached a height of 20 metres and&nbsp; shifted towards a nearby highway. The process substances and residues which were released by the explosion, were subsequently washed away by the extinguishing water used by the Finchimica fire brigade and were collected in the final emergency containment basin, with a capacity of ca. 1.600 m= (1400m= were collected following the accident), the plant personnel put the basin immediately into service for the successive treatment in the sewage treatment plant. During the collecting phase of the extinguishing water in the basin, a not perfectly closed interception valve allowed a certain amount of the extinguishing water to leak into the municipal sewage system and from there into an open air channel named \"colatore Moloncello\". Tests have been performed on samples taken from the affected water systems and the results are still under evaluation by the competent territorial authorities: however, from what is known to the company, there is no visible damage to the surrounding flora.",

        "Consequences": "From what is known to the company nobody has been affected directly by the accident and there is no evidence of health consequences either on-site or off-site.\nConcerning environmental consequences, the damages are mainly due to the limited spill in the sewage system as described before and are under evaluation by the competent territorial authorities (ASL, etc.).\nThe fire  caused the release of combustion products in the atmosphere deriving from the combustion of the process liquids and the coatings of the surrounding buildings. Concerning the evolution of the released combustion gases, the ASL, which intervened on a call of the 118 emergency response service, established, as declared in its report, the \"absence of a continuous diffusion of combustion gases in the atmosphere\".\nTechnicians of the SOPI (Operative Structure for Emergency Response of the ASL) carried out the necessary tests \"excluding the presence in the atmosphere of nitric acid, combustion gases as COx, NOx, SOx, hydrocyanic acid, and all other organic substances with a xylene infrared absorption spectrum.\nThe ASL itself has taken waste water samples (processing water, extinguishing water, etc.) for analysis; the results are under evaluation by the competent authorities.\nConcerning material damage, the accident caused on-site consequences as well as off-site consequences.\nOn-site the installation:\n- \"building 1 and 2\" with damage to equipment and structures,\n- the two road tankers affected by the blast wave and missile projection are out of service,\n- the control room of the office building with damages to the external walls, windows, and in the control room damage to the ceiling panelling.\nIn a more detailed way, in the control room windows and ceiling panelling were damaged by the pressure wave. The external walls were damaged by missiles projections of structural elements from buildings 1 and 2.\nThe largest metal fragment found weighs 120-130 kg.\nA missile  pierced the external metallic fence of the liquid hydrogen storage tank located ca. 60 m from the explosion point, without damaging the tank itself because it was shielded by building 2. Moreover the blast wave, which  expanded mostly on the N-S axis which was not protected by large buildings  reached also, apart from the already mentioned control room, the laboratory building and the management office building some 150 m away, causing the rupture of windows in both of them.\nOff-site, within a radius of 400 m, a few buildings were affected by rupture of windows and some missile projection. Metallic fragments were found onsite within a radius of 100 m and some others over the enclosure wall within a distance of 40-60 m from the wall (perforations with a maximum size of some dozen cm).\nIn a more detailed way concerning off-site consequences, using the establishment as orientation point:\n- eastwards, highway and mainly agricultural land, no damage has been reported until now.\n- northwards, two farm buildings, the first at a distance of 120 m, suffered broken windows, whereas the second, at a distance of 220 m, did not suffer any damage.\n- westwards, some private buildings and some installations being part of the industrial area, broken windows were reported.\n- southwards toll-gate of the highway (ca. 100 m) and the industrial area, no damage was reported.\nEcological Harm - Remarks:As already mentioned before, the territorial competent ASL is analysing the drawn water samples, in order to define the extent and magnitude of damage caused by the release of extinguishing water into the sewage system.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "As declared by the company, according to the on-site emergency plan, the shift manager alerted the on-site emergency service which intervened by activating the emergency shut-down system of the installation, the fixed extinguishing system and the water collection system.At the same time, one of the safety operators, in compliance with the on-site emergency plan, called the external fire brigade on No. 115, the emergency rescue service on No. 118, the competent ASL, the Prefecture of Brescia, the major and the civil protection group.At about 2:20 h, the off-site emergency response plan was activated when the fire brigade, arrived on-site, found the fire under control and took the control of the extinguishing and containment operations. Ordered by the prefect, the police and the carabinieri&nbsp; closed the highway between Brescia and Manerbio until 5:00 h, when the state of emergency was called off.Official action taken - legal action: The state attorneys office of Brescia is carrying out investigations.Official action taken - other official action: The competent ASL is carrying out investigations into possible contamination of the water of the channel named \"colatore Moloncello\", tributary of the river \"Mella\".",

        "Causes of the accident": "Operation error (operation against regulations)24/09/98, a transport container exploded during a cleansing process in the washing station of an organo-metallic compound production plant.After return from the customers, the transport containers undergo a thorough cleansing before a new filling. However, in this particular case, even after several attempts it was impossible to completely remove the deposits on the inner wall of the container. Tests aiming at the detection of reactive alkyl residues showed negative results. Thus, the deposits were exposed to an aqueous solution of caustic soda. Since no production of heat or gases had been detected over a period of several hours, to increase the effectiveness of the cleaning procedure the container was sealed and kept revolving around its longitudinal axis on a roller system. However, after a short time, the container burst, torn apart along the longitudinal axis, while a torospherical bottom&nbsp; was blown away and damaged a heptane pipeline. The released heptane ignited, and the whole building caught fire.The incident was caused by a pressure build-up inside the container caused by flammable gases, mainly hydrogen, formed by the chemical reaction of aqueous caustic soda solution with the aluminium alkyl residues. The container had been sealed infringing operating instructions.",
        "Consequences": "The event caused considerable material losses. Two persons suffered severe burns  - with fatal consequences in one case.",
        "Emergency response": "not given",
        "Lesson Learned": "- Cleaning operations of the containers are performed with a washing medium not reacting with deposits in the containers -- e.g. heptane.- Equip the washing station with weighing systems, allowing a determination of residue quantities after washing by weighing the container before and after the cleaning process; overfilling during the washing process can also be avoided.- Revision of the operating instructions.- Performing safety training activities.- Accident scenario modelling, for example incidents which include fire and explosions.- Reconsidering the alarm plans.- Carrying out additional safety analysis."

        "Accident Description": "Two reports conclude that repair work on an agitator that was carried out by an external firm triggered a fire on the fermenter, which also spread to the adjacent secondary fermenter.Significant material damage resulted, though no-one was injured.\nSequence of events from expert reports:After checking and inspecting the technical components for defects/deficiencies of a material nature or that could cause a fire themselves, and after inspecting external influences, these could be excluded as a cause of the fire.\nThis leaves human error as the possible cause of the damage. According to the workflow outlined, the service technicians should have detached the connecting cable from the traction cable in order to replace the defective traction cable with a new one.This would have detached the cable of the agitator from its fastening/mount.After the traction cable was replaced, the agitator\u2019s connecting cable should have been attached to the traction cable again. It seems that was either not done or it was not done correctly. The photos of the damage do not show the connecting cable reattached with the safety lock. This fastening of the connecting cable appears to have been forgotten after the replacement of the traction cable.This would explain how the connecting cable could get into the propeller of the agitator and be severed by it. The resulting severing of the connecting cable led to a short circuit that generated sparks. The resulting sparks ignited the gas in the fermenter. The oxygen concentration of the air/gas mixture in the fermenter was high enough at the time to ignite the gas and thus trigger the fire.\nThe connecting cable is secured to the traction cable with a stainless steel safety lock, which cannot become detached on its own. Likewise, the nature of the material rules out ageing or corrosion.\nSafety measures:The fire brigade, police and ambulances were on site within a few minutes. According to the fire brigade, when they arrived the roofs were burning in just a few small places.A little extinguishing work put the fire out within a few minutes. Two of the fire brigades remained on site until around 17:15 to put out any subsequent fires if necessary (which proved not to be the case).So that was just a precautionary measure.",

        "Lesson Learned": "The above analysis of causes suggests that the existing precautionary measures are as effective as possible. We still cannot completely rule out the risk of human error in the future.Additional checks on the final assembly would further reduce the risk. The high level of specialisation of the contracted assembly company means that the top priority is in improved quality control within the assembly company, which is largely outside the control of the facility operator. The facility operator has indeed increased its general vigilance with regard to work done by external companies. The staff\u2019s long years in the job should be particularly helpful in allowing them to use their experience to prevent risks in the future.Measures were taken to limit the impact, but it was not possible to prevent injury to the secondary fermenter. The materials used have now been given a fire-resistant finish (films) where possible. This is another constructive safeguard that may limit the effects of damage in the event of a future incident."

        "Causes of the accident": "At 02.05 on 17th February 2008 during stable plant operations, DCS operator noted that pressure loss was occurring in a butane refrigerated storage tank. Ambient temperature outside was -7 degrees C, well below the boiling point of butane. Action to arrest pressure loss by increasing heat input to the tank failed. Inspection of the tank area showed common mode failure of three pilot operated fire safety valves (FSVs), which lifted below set pressure and released butane to atmosphere. Operators isolated FSVs, pressure restored to normal, release stopped.Common mode failure of FSVs. Tyco (Anderson Greenwood) 9200 series pilot operated diaphragm valves. Low ambient temperature caused butane to condense out in the valve dome and sense line, pressure dropped, which caused valve to open. Valve mechanically sound and correctly set but not suitable for butane duty at low ambient temperatures or other fluids where ambient temperature may drop to below boiling point/dew point of fluid.",
        "Consequences": "The release did not ignite. There were no injuries or environmental harm, and no disruption to the local community. Those employees who carried out the emergency response were shaken. The material loss was difficult to calculate because the loss was relatively small compared to the overall plant inventory and the tank was continually receiving product from the plant at the time. Also it was not clear when, and for how long, each FSV was open.There was no damage to the plant.The fire case was not compromised.",
        "Emergency response": "On site action was taken. On Site/ Off Site plans were not invoked.The release was not immediately identified so operators initially acted to control the pressure drop. This increased the amount of butane released.

It was planned to substitute the gas pressure pipe being part of the reactor ethylene effective pressure measurement system. During shut down the operations of the plant the polymer in the high pressure separator&nbsp; (operative temperature 250\u00b0 C) is washed out of the container with cold ethylene (ca. 100\u00b0 C).12 kg of ethylene were released in the atmosphere due to a leakage in the flange coupling between the the high pressure separator and the low pressure separator. The released ethylene burned until the explosion occurred.

        "Finish Date": "2011-04-28 17:50:00",
        "Accident Description": "At 15:40 the workers of a refinery discovered a leak of aerosolised hydrocarbon fuel (HC: gas oil, hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide) in the gas oil desulphurising unit. This caused a release of hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide above the desulphurising unit. The leak was located at the exit of the desulphurisation reactor, at the level of the air coolers.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The study conducted by the operator shows that the leak came from a perforation in a bundle of ordinary carbon steel tubes in one of the four air coolers of the unit. This was caused by corrosion linked to the presence of ammonium disulphides produced by the combination of H2S from desulphurisation and of nitrogen from denitrification in the reactor. Water is constantly injected upstream in order to dissolve this substance and prevent deposition. The unit was modified five years earlier to meet the specifications for low-sulphur fuels. This may have played a role in the accident by increasing denitrification in the reactor and therefore the concentration of corrosive products. corrosion",
        "Consequences": "The unit was decompressed (20-bar network) through flaring and then degassed using nitrogen. There were no victims, but residents of the neighbouring municipality located downwind started complaining about odours late in the afternoon. The sensors of the municipality confirmed that the recommended information threshold for sulphur dioxide (SO2) was exceeded between 16:00 and 17:00. The operator suffered production losses of several million euros owing to the slow-down of the units on the platform, the 15-day closure of the desulphurising unit and non-desulphurised gas oils, which are harder to sell.",
        "Emergency response": "The worker responsible for control of the unit activated its automatic shutdown and the water curtains of the oven. The internal rescue team was alerted at 15:45, and at 15:47 the 1 500 employees of the platform (refinery + petrochemicals) were ordered to remain indoors. The operator launched the internal operating plan at 15:50 and the internal rescue team installed water curtains around the unit. The public rescue services sent a fire officer to the operator's facility.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Below are the lessons learned by the operator:\n-\tthis type of equipment is difficult to inspect, because a single non-compliant bend out of 368 caused the accident;\n-\tthe inspections carried out were appropriate for detecting zones of erosion in the bends, which can be found by radiography because of their highly irregular surface. However, the method was unsuitable for this type of corrosion, located downstream from the seam joint on the right side of the tube, resulting in an even surface with very irregular wear on the edge of the seam joint.\nThe operator decided to install during the next stoppage in 2012 new air coolers using metal that is more resistant to this type of corrosion and a design better adapted to bends/seam joints."

        "Finish Date": "1990-11-29 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "An operator disconnected a drain assembly connected to the depropaniser reboiler until it was remained only a partially opened but blocked 50mm valve (from the Original Report it is not fully clear if it was a 50mm or a 15mm valve). The blockage was caused by caustic soda and the operator played steam over the valve to clear the blockage. The blockage was cleared but the operator was unable to close the gate valve due to caustic soda and LPG released at high temperature and pressure (the disconnection of the pipework was not done in accordance with the sites standing instructions). In order to reduce the pressure in the depropaniser to mininimise the amount of LPG escaping from the 50mm valve, a 406mm pneumatically operated depressurizing valve was opened. This valve, with a rated capacity of 13.375 tons per minute, was designed to depressurize the interconnected depropaniser and polypropylene splitter columns in 15 minutes via a 762mm line into the main 910mm flareheader. After the depressurizing valve was opened, the 50mm gate valve connected to the depropaniser was closed by an operator wearing breathing apparatus. The LPG released was safely dispersed. The emergency depressurising valve was open for 2'19\". At a low point in the 762mm line to the main flareheader described above there was located a small (254mm diameter, 600mm high) sump. At the bottom of this sump there was a 38mm diameter pipe to drain accumulated liquid into a nearby vessel. The liquid accumulated in this vessel was automatically pumped away. The sump was however blocked with debris and this allowed a large amount of liquid (about 30 m3) to accumulate in the 762mm line. The escaping gas from the depressurizing valve caused this liquid to be dispersed down the flareline and the forces generated caused about 100m of 762mm line to be displaced, falling approximately 10 metres to the ground. The pipeline buckled and in a few points there were some crackings. In one point a crack was found to have propagated through the 77% of the 10mm nominal thickness of the pipeline wall. The pipeline did not however failed and no LPG was released from this source.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nThe initiating event was the release of LPG through 15mm drain valve (initiallly blocked by caustic soda) connected to the depropaniser reboiler. The operator was unable to close the valve after its blockage was cleared out by means of steam. In order to reduce the amount of released LPG, the depropaniser and polypropylene splitter columns were depressurised via an emergency depressurising valve to a flareline. A  blockage in the flareline resulted in its displacement.\nCAUSES:\nThe initiating event was caused by the blockage of a drain valve by caustic soda. The disconnection of the pipework was not done in accordance with the sites standing procedures that, however, were inadequate for clearing a pipe blockage. The flareline displacement was caused by the failure to maintain the line free of blockages (no written procedures were instituted to avoid it and, besides, the design of the flareline drainage arrangements made its maintenance difficult).",
        "Consequences": "MATERIAL LOSS:The cost of reinstating the collapsed flareline was about 1,450,000 EurosAffected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The emergency depressurization of the interconnected depropaniser and polypropylene splitter columns was activated in order to minimize the amount of LPG released from the drain valve. After the activation of the emergency depressurization, the drain valve was closed by an operator wearing breathing apparatus. Besides, as precautionary measures:- all the areas in the vicinity of the plant were evacuated;- the internal fire brigade was alerted and attended incident;- mobile and fixed fire monitors were set-up downwind of the damaged sections of flareline;- roads in the area were closed;- the county fire brigades were called.Emergency measures - Remarks: The emergency depressurization of the interconnected depropaniser and polypropylene splitter columns was activated in order to minimize the amount of LPG released through the drain valve (code 7104) and the gate valve connected to the depropaniser was closed by an operator wearing breathing apparatus (code 7107). Inside the establishment, as precautionary measures: the internal fire brigade was alerted and attended the accident (code 7107); the fire crew set-up mobile and fixed fire monitors downwind of the damaged sections of the flareline; roads in the plant area were closed (code 7208) and all areas in vicinity of the plant were evacuated (code 7401); the county fire brigades were called (code 7201).

        "Accident Description": "On 15&nbsp;September&nbsp;2015, an alert (measurement position \u2014 rundown) was registered in the VCM control room. Investigations into the cause revealed a leak in the stuffing box of a valve.The shift foreman then used the distributed control system (15&nbsp;September&nbsp;2015, 23.15, DCS standby) to bridge two high vacuum (HV) valves (referred to in-house as \u2018forced\u2019 (forced into another valve position)) -&gt; valve position closed (entry present in the VCM facility\u2019s bridge log book). The system was subsequently released and prepared for a valve replacement the next day.The valve replacement was carried out without incident and was handed over once production was complete.Production staff carried out a leakage test on the system (results negative). For the necessary oxygen-free purge, a nitrogen purge (7-8&nbsp;bar) of the previously opened system was carried out. The purging process involved releasing the purging medium (N2) into the atmosphere via a 2\u201d valve. On 16&nbsp;September&nbsp;2015, from 15.34 to 16.04, a substance release (liquid VCM) occurred via the 2\u201d valve.Safety function: The alarm (measuring point: 585&nbsp;ppm) was activated in the control room at 15.53. No explosion warning devices were triggered. The control room operator informed the external operator and the shift foreman, both of whom then went to the part of the facility affected.There the leak was detected (VC leak, 2\u201d flush nozzle, approx. 1-2&nbsp;bar). Breathing protection equipment was fetched, which the shift foreman wore while closing the flush nozzle and ending the leak. The liquid VCM was collected from the area subject to the Federal Water Act. The VC vaporised and ice/snow formed, along with a gas cloud (light southerly wind in the direction of the VC spheres). A large part of the area was cordoned off and the VC was transferred into a nearby collecting basin by production staff (breathing protection, chemical protective suit, rubber boots) and channelled into the internal sewage system using water. At no point during the incident was the on-site fire service alerted.The analysis in the distributed control system (DCS) estimated a total of around 5&nbsp;t of VCM.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The system was to be put back in operation. To this end, the shift foreman ordered an O2 analysis to be carried out by the laboratory. This measurement had not yet been taken.On the assumption that an HV valve remains in the closed position following the removal of the \u2018DCS bridge\u2019 until an acknowledgement from the control room, the shift foreman ordered the DCS team to remove the \u2018bridge\u2019 in the DCS.There was no direct contact between the shift foreman and the DCS team; the DCS team member was in contact with the control room operator. However, when the \u2018bridge\u2019 was removed, the valve was opened and VCM from a higher rundown tank was able to escape via the 2\u201d valve that had been opened for purging, leading to the substance release. In order to bring a swift end to substance leaks, a facility kill switch for the rundown section is provided, which closes all tank outlets, including the HV valve. However, this feature was not activated, either on-site or from the control room.\nDirect causes1) Circumstances:- Open venting valve (2\u201d valve for purging) and simultaneous opening of an HV valve by removing the bridge.- No additional closure or separation in the intake.\n2) Actions:Safety features taken out of operation:- Instruction to DCS staff to remove the bridge.- DCS staff removed the \u2018bridge\u2019 (HV valve forced \u2018shut\u2019).\nNon-compliance with basic safety regulations:- No additional separation (e.g. blanking spade) deemed necessary by production staff.\n(Wrong) decisions made:- Purging the pipe with nitrogen and releasing it into the air via a 2\u201d venting valve.- O2 analysis required but not yet carried out; nonetheless, clearance given to remove the \u2018bridge\u2019.\nIndirect causes:Training:- Insufficient knowledge of the workings of the part of the facility and the \u2018bridge\u2019 that had been put in place.\nCommunication:- No compulsory communication method agreed (e.g. signed form) between those responsible for removing bridges.- No direct communication between the shift foreman and DCS staff. Inadequate or non-existent safety regulations:- Rules for working on parts of the facility that channel the product and for separating the systems unclear.- No clear regulations on purging systems.- No uniform regulations established with regard to bridges, and in particular removing bridges and the necessary communication and clearance. As regards the remaining series of events following the substance release, it should be noted that there was insufficient knowledge of the contingency measures required according to the alarm and danger prevention plan. Measures taken, such as transferring the escaped substance without special explosions prevention measures, are also subject to criticism.",
        "Consequences": "No impairment of people / employees inside and outside the establishment. also no impact to property or environmental impact. Water was used to flush the escaped VCM into the internal sewage system to prevent further vaporisation.",

Following an investigation, the venting valve was closed using breathing protection.Water was then used to flush the VCM into the internal sewage system.&nbsp;\nWater was used to flush the escaped VCM into the internal sewage system to prevent further vaporisation.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Short term:- All employees informed about the incident.- Shift foreman and deputy given training on how the barriers work on the rundown tanks and the safe approach when working in this area. Medium term:\n\nTraining on the strictly compulsory contingency measures under the alarm plan and how to handle leaks of hazardous substances, in particular VCM.\nCreation of clear and unambiguous regulations on:\n\n- working on parts of the facility that channel the product and separating the systems (required partitions, authorisation, identification, etc.);- purging the systems;- bridging, and in particular removing bridges and the required communication and clearance. Direct technical measures were not identified, as this was an incident which occurred not during normal operation, but during repair works, which can occur in such a form in any part of the facility. A specific technical measure did not therefore seem expedient; instead the organisational systems and regulations must be adjusted so that sufficient safety measures are taken whenever work is being carried out on systems channelling hazardous substances."

        "Accident Description": "At 11:00 a.m. on Nov. 24, 2005, an explosion accident happened at a chemical plant in Xinmin Town, Dianjiang County, Chongqing Municipality, resulting in 1 death and 5 people injured. The cause of the accident was that when workers used hydrogen peroxide to handle sulfur-containing impurities of benzene, they poured hydrogen peroxide into the reactor too fast, causing the reactor to explode due to dramatic chemical reactions. After the accident happened, the local government urgently evacuated more than 6,000 students and residents of nearby schools and residential areas. While firefighters put out the fire caused by the explosion, the firefighting water carried unburned benzene (about 4t) into Guixi River in Xinmin Town, threatening the downstream drinking water sources (Guixi River flows into Caojia River which flows into Gaotan River. Although there is no drinking water fetching point along Gaotan River, the river flows into Longxi River, along which a downstream lake called Changshou Lake is the drinking water fetching point of Changshou District of Chongqing. The drinking water fetching point is about 123km from the explosion place).",

        "Consequences": "In the explosion 1 person died and 5 people injured.",
        "Emergency response": "After the accident happened, the local government urgently evacuated more than 6,000 students and residents of nearby schools and residential areas. While firefighters put out the fire caused by the explosion, the firefighting water carried unburned benzene (about 4t) into Guixi River in Xinmin Town, threatening the downstream drinking water sources (Guixi River flows into Caojia River which flows into Gaotan River. Although there is no drinking water fetching point along Gaotan River, the river flows into Longxi River, along which a downstream lake called Changshou Lake is the drinking water fetching point of Changshou District of Chongqing. The drinking water fetching point is about 123km from the explosion place).\nBased on the site pollution situation and the pollution handling progress, the emergency command headquarters took a series of effective measures:\n1) It ordered the downstream Changshou District to closely monitor the river water at the point where the river flows into the territory of the district; once an excessive concentration of benzene was found, monitoring workers were instructed to immediately report this to the district government and release information to the public about the situation of the drinking water source;\n2) It ordered the government of Dianjiang County to completely isolate the pollutants at the accident site and to handle the isolated benzene;\n3) It ordered various levels of local environmental protection departments to closely monitor the environment, to closely track the movement and concentration change of the pollutants, to predict the diffusion trend of the benzene pollutant according to the hydrological parameters of the river, and to timely evaluate the blockade and adsorption effect of pollutants along the river; and\n4) It closed the waterlocks of Gaoan Dam and Gaodong Dam in the upstream of Changshou Lake to cut off water flowing into the territory of the Changshou District, ensuring that the pollutants would be blocked within the upstream river of Gaodong Dam and preventing the pollutants from entering the Changshou Lake.\nAfter five days of salvage and adsorption, most of benzene was adsorbed, rescued and evaporated within the Caojia River, and only a small amount (about 63kg according to estimates and calculation) entered Gaotan River; after multiple layers of adsorption and treatment, the pollutants were basically eliminated between the Sanhe Estuary of Gaotan River and Gaoan Dam. As of 4:00 pm on Nov. 29, after more than 40 hours of continuous emergency treatment, no benzene was detected in the entire Gaotan River. The threat of the pollutants downstream of the Gantan River had already been eliminated. The pollutants did not affect the Longxi River and the Changshou Lake, which is a drinking water source for residents of Changshou District. At 7:00 pm on Nov. 29, Chongqing municipal government finally lifted the alarm related to the environmental pollution caused by the explosion accident. Environmental protection departments of both Chongqing Municipality and Dianjiang County responded rapidly, organizing environmental monitoring workers to deploy 10 monitoring points within an about 100km range along Caojia River, Gaotan River and Longxi River to continuously monitor the water quality and to closely track the drift of the pollution belt. The Dianjiang county government immediately set up an accident rescue and investigation group and took effective measures to prevent the diffusion of pollutants. In the 24km-long Caojia River, the group urgently used straw, activated carbon and charcoal to build 9 dams to block pollutants from drifting downstream.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Avoid ad hoc changes to the formula and follow written procedures, specification of the speed rate to prevent overcharging.Operators have to be aware of potential chemical risks, reactivity and the characteristics of the chemical material they handle. Hazard identification or HAZOP study is necessary as well as adequate training to operators."

Through investigation, the cause of the incident was that a working bulldozer broke the J164 + 200m section of the pipeline of Chengqing Oilfield, causing about 142t crude oil in the pipeline to leak into the environment, and resulting in oil pollution to about 0.3 hectare of forestland.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A working bulldozer broke the J164 + 200m section of the oil pipeline of Chengqing Oilfield.",
        "Consequences": "142t crude oil in the pipeline to leak into the environment, and resulting in oil pollution to about 0.3 hectare of forestland.",
        "Emergency response": "After receiving reports about the incident, the leaders of Yan' an Bureau of Environmental Protection and the leaders of the government of Baota District and relevant departments immediately hurried to the incident site and took corresponding measures to handle the incident, including:\n1) Organized more than 100 workers from Nanniwan Oil Production Plant of Changqing Oilfied (belonging to Yan' an Petroleum Group Corp.) and mobilized machinery and equipment from the plant to dispose of the incident. The rescue workers cut off the power at the incident site, built 3 dams to block the leaked oil within a dry ditch to prevent it from flowing into the Pine River (a Class Two branch of Yellow River; its downstream has drinking water sources) and then recovered the leaked crude oil at the incident site;\n2) Shut down the valve of the oil pipeline and blocked the broken pipeline. By 2:40 pm, the leaking pipeline had been blocked. At 5:00 pm, Changqing Oilfield organized workers to weld the broken pipeline. At 10:00 pm, the pipeline resumed its oil delivery function;\n3) Mobilized 12 oil tank trucks and other vehicles to recover the leaked crude oil. By 11:00 pm, the leaked oil had been basically all recovered, and the polluted soil was disposed of with landfill and leakproof measures.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Strengthen the protection of oil pipelines: Oil transport enterprises should increase their safety and prevention awareness. From the design, construction, operation, maintenance and supervision of oil pipelines, they should try to take the safety of oil transport as the starting point, trying to reduce unnecessary environmental pollution caused by the leakage of oil pipelines. At the same time, they should strengthen the public awareness education of oil pipeline protection, monitoring and management, and encourage the local residents to participate in pipeline protection and active supervision and to timely report illegal behaviors to relevant authorities."

        "Finish Date": "1993-07-16 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident involved a cadmium distillation column. The column was\nformed by a stack of 59 silicon carbide trays heated to 1000\u00b0C. The\nheating chamber enclosing the bottom of the distillation column was\nkept depressurised.\nThe temperature was monitored at different points of the distillation\nunit, and the temperature control was assured by regulating manually\nboth the gas flow to the burners and the draught. The essential\nmaintenance task was to absorb zinc oxides releases which occurred\nrelatively frequently between the trays, fouling the installation.&nbsp; The\ncleaning operation was performed through inspection openings on the\nwalls of the heating chamber, which were closed during operation with\nrefractory plugs and sealed with clay. This operation was performed by\nrefractory bricklayers employed by the company or by a specialised\nsubcontractor.\nIndependently, the columns were operated permanently during 18 months.\nAny shut-down or significant drop in temperature would have caused the\nrupture of the trays, particularly sensitive to thermal shocks.\nThe accident scenario was as follows:\n- 27/05/1993: 7 weeks before the event, start-up of the column in which\nthe accident originated after refurbishment (new tray stack, new flues)\n- 24/06/93: start of the effective production phase\n- 24/06/93: 17:00 h an abnormal rumbling noise which had never been\nheard before in a refurbished installation, alerted the operators. An\ninspection showed a temperature rise in the heat exchanger and a\nsignificant fouling.\n- 25/06/93: during the morning before the event, several operations\nwere carried out without success to re-establish normal operating\nconditions.\n- 25/06/93: at 12:10 h a sudden divergence of the lateral temperatures was observed in the heating chamber.\n- 25/06/93: at 12:25 h 11persons (production manager, workshop manager,\nexperienced employees, temporary personnel, refractory bricklayers from\na subcontractor) were located near the column when the accident\noccurred. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "Different assumptions can be made concerning the causes of the accident:1. - The fouling of the combustion chamber caused by considerable zinc oxides releases, lead to an incomplete combustion process and the formation of non-combusted gas pockets, which exploded when fresh air was supplied by the opening of inspection openings or of the flues.2. - The oxygen impoverishment of the oven permitted a direct reaction of the zinc released by the leaking column and the carbon dioxide present. This reaction is very exothermic.3. - The simultaneous opening of several inspection openings extinguished the burners causing a collapse of several trays and an uncontrolled vaporisation of the zinc.",
        "Consequences": "The explosion first caused the projection of a series of lids (plugs) due to a violent internal overpressure. A muffled explosion noise was perceived by the personnel in the control room some dozen metres from the column. A burning gas cloud was emitted by the column, forming a white fog which diffused in a few minutes in the whole workshop.Human losses were very high: the 11 persons present were seriously burned, 10 died in the following minutes, hours or days, the only survivor suffered 90% burns.",
        "Emergency response": "The explosion was violent. The intervention of on-site emergency response systems could not be made.\nExternal emergency response services could only evacuate the victims.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Investigations were carried out. The reconstruction and operation of the column was subjected to an improvement of the operating rules and procedures concerning the installation of new trays, the checking of the factors linked to temperature rises, the detection of failures and the release of alarm, the emergency measures, personal protection measures on the most exposed workplaces."

In the condenser aspiration pipe formed an underpressure. In the gas aspiration line was installed a water trap, whose drain had a plastic tube stopped that in turn was submerged in the bottom of a plastic tube filled with water. For the underpressure the water was aspirated out of the plastic tube, but deposits remained in the lower parts. Due to an underpressure protection the mean pressure condenser failed. Now the back flowing air arrived to the high pressure condenser. The hydrogen formed together with the air an explosive gas which autoignited.

        "Accident Description": "A wood-dust-explosion occurred in a plant for the production of wooden chipboards during the loading operation of a combustion installation, 4 persons were injured. The explosion occurred on the bottom-side (under-side) of the drag-chain conveyor. The returning drag-chains are coated and form with the bottom of the trough an essentially closed room (space). The conveyor has the function to transport fuel, mainly&nbsp; in the form of chips and pieces of wood, from a bulk pit (hole) to the combustion chamber. The fuel is fed, in correspondence of the supply (transfer) point, in the combustion chamber through a lock (gate). The actual cause of the explosion (accident root cause) could not yet be identified. Probably the explosion was ignited through a flame-transmission from the furnace. In principle it is possible that an ignition source has penetrated in the drag-chain conveyor from the bulk pit or the combustion chamber. The possibility that the ignition source originated from the bulk pit can be excluded, considering the fact that the fuel was frozen due to the low external temperatures, and that it is very unlikely that the frozen fuel ignites (catches fire). The ignition source could have been transmitted from the furnace, even if the fuel is fed through a lock. Due to the rough (harsh) operation conditions it is plausible that the lock-flaps did not close tight. It is also plausible that the explosion occurred in the combustion chamber or that the under-pressure control was disturbed.Four persons doing repair works on a filter in the direct vicinity of (immediately near) the drag-chain-conveyor were injured by the explosion. Two persons could be sent home from hospital after ambulant treatment, whereas the two other persons had to be hospitalised for a longer period due to the burns on their faces.The paneling of the drag-chain-conveyor was ripped off by the explosion.Wood dust-explosion (deflagration of wood-dust) in a combustion installation",

Shortly after, alarms from gas and hydrogen sulphidedetectors were received from a biofilm plant, located approximately 70 metres from the tank. The gas readings quicklyincreased to 100% of the lower explosion limit and up to 40 ppm hydrogen sulphide. The experience in the control roomwas that the situation developed very quickly, was difficult to understand and that it was out of control. The firstassessment was that the tank was overflowing, but&nbsp; no pumps delivering to the tank were running at thetime. The evacuation alarm was activated. Within three to four minutes the gas alarms cleared, and the tank level wasnormalised. Emergency preparedness personnel were quickly mobilised. Smoke divers did not find any traces of oil spillwhen searching around the tank. The temperature in the tank was examined using a thermal camera, and smoke diversturned off the steam supply using valves at the tank. The thermal camera showed gas/steam rising upwards from thetank. The situation gradually normalised, and the \u2018danger over\u2019 signal was sounded at approximately 01:00 the nextmorning.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The direct cause was sudden boiling with phase transition and foaming (slopover) in the tank due to overheating. Parts of an emulsion layer in the tank was dissolved due to&nbsp; high temperature&nbsp;in the underlying water zone. A rapid transfer of heat took place as oil and water from the hot emulsion layer and from&nbsp;the water zone mixed with the oil layers resulting in boiling in the oil phase. This initiated foaming and release of gas. This&nbsp;is a process that can occur in oil tanks containing a water phase and heat supply.\nThere are many underlying causes:\n\nLack of barriers. Some barriers (for example automatic temperature control on the tank) had been removed without proper MOC in earlier modifications. Inadequate risk assessment of changes&nbsp; and inadequate hazop and follow up of hazop.\nLoss of competency, knowledge and understanding of risks associated to the specific operation.\nPersonnel acceptance of deviations as being \"normal\" (temperature alarms in control room not trusted, believed to be unreliable)\nIntroduction of new type of waste to the water treatment tank (containing more lighter hydrocarbons than before) without&nbsp;assessment of the increased risk.\n",
        "Consequences": "The incident resulted in a release of approximately 1100 kilos of process gas.\nThe investigation team classified the incident with the highest actual degree of seriousness Actual Red 1 - Oil / Gasleakage and highest potential degree of seriousness under slightly different circumstances Possible Red 1 - Death.Slightly different circumstances mean that it is only by chance that alternative outcomes of the incident did not occur, andnot what could have happened in a worst-case scenario. It was only by chance that the spill did not increase or ignite.The classification is based on the emission rate, presence of ignition sources and estimated consequences if personnelhad been exposed to ignition of the gas. The incident is classified with the highest degree of severity Red 1.Experience from events referenced by Shell documents the potential of similar events. In the investigation team's opinion,it was pure chance that the incident at Mongstad did not have a more serious outcome in the form of a major accident.There were no technical barriers that could have prevented a further increase in the tank temperature. If the temperaturehad been a few degrees higher, causing boiling in the water phase, the outcome would have been much more serious.Gas detection was very limited in the offsite area. Road traffic, streetlights and unprotected buildings would be potentialsources of ignition for a large gas cloud. The outcome with regard to personal injury in such an event would have beenaffected by the time of day, activity level and the number of people at the facility.",
        "Emergency response": "The area was evacuated according to internal procedures. Internal&nbsp; emergency preparedness personnel were quickly mobilised.

The temperature in the tank was examined using a thermal camera, and&nbsp;fire fighters turned off the steam supply using valves at the tank.&nbsp; The \u2018danger over\u2019 signal was sounded at approximately 01:00 the next&nbsp;morning.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Based on the cause of the incident, recommendations&nbsp; have been given:\n- Need for improved Process knowledge,&nbsp;improvements in training of personnel,&nbsp;updating of documentation,- Improvement of technical safety barriers to prevent similar incidents,- The need for gas detection in the area in question,- Zero tolerance regarding acceptance of deviations as being \"normal\",- Risk assessment of operational changes,- Increased quality in HAZOP reviews and closure of findings."

        "Accident Description": "Unexpected release of hydrogen sulphide gas occurred at a plant for production of ferric chloride from waste pickling solution. Two workers were manually adding solid phase sodium sulphide to a liquid phase pickling solution. The release occurred because the pH value of the solution was too low and too much sodium sulphide was added. The two workers were killed. The initial concentration of the released gas was at least 1000 ppm.\n1999, the initiating event was the addition of solid phase sodium\nsulphide to liquid phase spent pickling solutions, which had far too\nlow a pH value. The intention was to precipitate heavy metals in the\nsolution. However, the very low pH value induced formation of hydrogen\nsulphide gas rather than precipitation of heavy metals.[TEXT 1]\nOn the afternoon of the 9th of may 1995, there was a release of hydrogen sulphide gas at a plant, which resulted in the death of two process workers. The release occurred at a plant for the production of ferric chloride from waste pickling solutions. The two workers were manually adding solid phase sodium sulphide to a liquid phase pickling solution. The pH value of the pickling solution was much too low and too much sodium sulphide was added. Therefore instead of the expected chemical reaction (precipitation) an unexpected reaction (formation of hydrogen sulphide gas) occurred.\n\n[TEXT 2]\nThe time of \"major occurrence - finish\" which has been stated is the time when the municipal Rescue Service had concluded that the two process operators were deceased.\nAccident Gravity Scale=3\n[TEXT 3]\nThe site is covered by the Seveso I directive because of the use of chlorine.\n\nMeteorological conditions - Remarks: Sunny day, with clear sky and steady wind.Wind speed: 2.60; Wind direction: north; Wind stability: stable; Temperature: 10.00, Precipitation: NoneDiscussions about the occurrence: The human factor and lack of chemical-technical knowledge. Among other things no proper pH check of the spent pickling solutions was carried out. Inadequate management procedures, the work carried out in an improvised manner instead of following established procedures. Inadequate supervision of how the work was actually carried out and a lack of safety culture. The activity of the establishment was not in accordance with the license issued on the basis of the Environmental Protection Act.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The human factor and lack of chemical-technical knowledge. Among other things no proper pH check of the spent pickling solution was carried out. Inadequate management procedures, the work carried out in an improvised manner instead of following working procedures. Inadequate supervision of how the work was actually carried out and a lack of safety culture. The activity of the establishment was not in accordance with the license issued on the basis of the Environmental Protection Act.No proper pH value check was made of the spent pickling solutions, in the reaction vessels, into which sodium sulphide was added. Various inappropriate, temporary arrangements were used in order to facilitate the adding of sodium sulphide. Therefore the roof covering directly above the reaction vessels was removed and a temporary ladder arrangement was in place in order to facilitate human access to the top of the reaction vessels.",
        "Consequences": "The two process workers were immediately killed due to the inhalation of hydrogen sulphide gas. The accident and associated negative effects stem from inadequate management procedures which made it possible for staff to conduct work in an improvised manner characterized by many inappropriate temporary arrangements, and insufficient checking of parameters (especially solution pH) of vital importance.Area concerned - Remarks: The evolved hydrogen sulphide gas dissipated in the atmosphere to a non dangerous concentration within a few minutes.People - Remarks:The person who went to look for the process operators that did not come down from the grating at the top of the reactor vessels, was himself potentially at risk, since he did not know about the evolved hydrogen sulphide gas.Material Loss - Remarks:Costs: 20,000 Euros (Off site losses due to rescue activities and social costs associated with the two deceased process operators.)Community Disruption - Remarks:Significant media interest was reported. To some extent this media interest disturbed the psychological counselling of the co-workers of the deceased process operators. The Swedish Board of Accident Investigation pointed out that in this type of situation a responsible person should be appointed to deal with the media.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "The municipal rescue service arrived on scene about 15-20 minutes after the incident efforts were made to revive the two process workers but to no avail. The clothes of the two process operators were cut open and removed from their bodies since their clothes were to some extent suspected of serving as a poisonous gas trap. The two process operators were rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital where doctors concluded that the two operators had deceased. Storage of the bodies at the hospital caused some problems because they&nbsp; emitted large amounts of H2S.Emergency measures - Remarks:From the factory the national emergency alarm centre was phoned as soon as the accident had been detected. The emergency centre sent out the local Rescue Service, a staffed ambulance, and notified the local hospital via telefax.Official action taken - legal action: The court fined the company 70,000 Euros for breaking The Occupational Safety and Health  Act. They also fined the Director 1300 Euros and gave him a conditional sentence.Official action taken - other official action: Investigation reports from the Swedish Board of Accident Investigation and the Swedish National Labour Inspectorate have been prepared. The latter contains photographs from the scene.Discussion about response: From the factory the national emergency alarm centre was phoned as soon as the accident had been detected. The emergency centre sent out the local Rescue Service, a staffed ambulance, and notified the local hospital via telefax.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons learned  - Description: Spent pickling\nsolutions to which sodium sulphide is to be added (for precipitation of\nheavy metals) must be properly pH checked prior to addition of sodium\nsulphide. The pH value must be at least 4.5. It is of paramount\nimportance that firm, well planned working procedures are adhered to in\nthis type of industry. Improvised procedures introduce great risk.Measures to prevent recurrence: Improved management routines and improved safety training of the staff were found to be necessary. A review is also necessary in order to check if there are more critical parameters which should be analysed on a routine basis in order to ensure safety and minimize risks. The entire staff at the process factory in question need to change their attitude in a direction which caters for more consideration of safety and risk related aspects. The accident also highlights the difficulties of assessing staff education, general knowledge and experience in safety matters for the authorities.Measures to mitigate consequences: Psychological counselling of co-workers and relatives of the deceased took place soon after the accident had occurred."

Earlier  the company that to notify due to a storage of liquefied anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAccident Gravity Scale=4\n\nType of accident - Remarks: The major occurrence (1101) release of gas to the atmosphere was caused by the initiating event (1306) decomposition of NPK-fertiliser to NOx. The decomposition was only possible because of mixing two products, one containing copper and the other containing chloride, these formed together a product with self-sustaining decomposition properties. The temperature increase caused by the decomposition initiated minor secondary fires e.g. in electrical cables.Meteorological conditions - Precipitation: noneMeteorological conditions - Wind speed: 3.00Meteorological conditions - Wind direction: SMeteorological conditions - Wind stability: EMeteorological conditions - Temperature: 20.00Meteorological conditions - Remarks: None",
        "Causes of the accident": "The decomposition took place in a spherodizer for crystallisation and drying, due to decomposition or runaway reactions.&nbsp;Due to a preceding production of a product containing copper, and subsequent production of a chloride containing product, these two products were mixed and formed a product with self sustaining decomposition properties (class B fertiliser), which the spherodizer received. Caused by blocking of the outlet of the spherodizer the temperature and the retention time in the spherodizer increased. As a consequence decomposition of the product was initiated. This process generated mainly nitrogen oxides which escaped to the building and through the stack. \nThe rate of decomposition/run away process was so fast, that the operators were not able to initiate water spraying of the spherodizer.",
        "Consequences": "There were only material losses.\nThe citizens were warned out to a distance of 2 kilometres in the wind\ndirection. No damage outside the factory building. No persons in the\ncity were affected. The concentration of nitrogen oxides are not known. Nobody from the off-site population was injured. Firstly it was Saturday morning (weekend), secondly due to early warning, thirdly the concentration of nitrogen oxides was not high enough to cause harm as most of the gas was vented through the  factory stack. Ecological harm - Remarks: Expectation of ecological harm or damage should not be expected for that type of accident because of dilution of the gasses escaping from the stack.\nWater used for stopping decomposition was transported to the public water treatment plant.Disruption of community life: Roads close to the site were closed by police.\nMaterial loss - Remarks: 10 - 15 000 000 DKR estimated cost to operator.Material loss - Establishment losses - material max euro: 1700000Material loss - Establishment losses - material max local: 1250000000Material loss - Local currency: DKKAffected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localEcological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of :       Ecological component: residential area (covered by toxic cloud) - Affected Yes",
        "Emergency response": "The on-site emergency plan was put into action. The on-site emergency plan was efficient and sufficient. The actions taken included evacuation of 3 employees. 4 operators were hospitalised for observation. The off-site emergency plan was also initiated, the actions taken included that neighbours were ordered to stay indoor and ordered to close doors and windows. The duration for these measures was two hours.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:a) Full cleaning of the facility after production of copper containing products.b) Improved control system and separation between control and safety systems.c) Systematic storage of process data.d) Improved working procedures and instructions.e) Automatic stop of N-gas heater in case of spherodizer stop.f) Reassessment of the internal emergency plan.g) Emergency water supply to all spherodizers.Useful references: Rapport in Danish:\"Undersogelsesrapport over uheldet p\u00e5 Kemira den 24. august 1996\", Udarbejdet af Vejle Amt i samarbejde med COWI, Arbejdstilsynet, Fredericia Kommune, Brand &amp; Redning.

A few operators on shift tried to find out the\nreason for this, but they hardly had any time to do so when the\npressure had risen above normal level.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A runaway reaction is suspected as the cause of the explosion. The root cause of the accident is still under investigation.At the time of the accident the plant and the reactor were stopped due\nto maintenance work and the reactor had been left in a stand-by\ncondition for a day. Earlier in the afternoon attempts had been made to\nclear a clogged pipeline leading from the reactor, but without success.\nIt was planned to continue the maintenance work the next day. During\nthe evening shift the temperature and pressure of the reactor started\nto rise inexplicably. A few operators on the shift tried to evaluate\nthe reason for this phenomenon, but the pressure rose above normal\nvalues very quickly. One operator went to check out the status of the\nreactor and immediately after that the reactor exploded and a huge fire\nresulted.The investigation following the accident showed that an unexpected chemical reaction in the production process was the cause of the explosion. It was discovered that the increase of temperature in the reactor to over 300 degrees Celsius led to a break down of the process intermediate, sodium methoxy borohydride, and this led to gases being formed to such an extent that their pressure broke the reactor. Flammable gases and liquids were released in the explosion and set the reactor building on fire. The rise of temperature of the chemical liquid in the reactor was caused&nbsp; by a deposit in the reactor base as well as heat formed by mechanical friction of the reactor stirred. The rise in temperature in the reactor was not discovered in the control room, because the measurement device was covered by an insulating deposit layer. Process reactions were not well enough known and the system was not designed to cope with an exothermic reaction. Also, the safety and control equipment for the system were inadequate. Information from any similar accident experience concerning this exceptional chemical reaction was not available.",
        "Consequences": "After pressure in the reactor had risen above normal level one operator went to check out the status of the reactor. Immediately after that the reactor exploded and a huge fire followed. This operator died in the accident. Due to explosion the vent panels of the building were blown off, the reactor and several pumps, pipelines and other process equipment were destroyed. Costs unknown however several million euro.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "The fire was extinguished by three fire brigades from municipalities nearby.Official action taken - legal action: None based on the Seveso legislation.Official action taken - other official action: The operation license was cancelled and the plant has to apply for a new license.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: When a new process is designed the recurrence of similar chemical reactions has to be taken into account by studying the process with as reliable methods as possible. Also the system must be equipped with appropriate pressure relief devices and a reactor emptying system as well as adequate process control methods."

The gas holder had 4 lifts and a total capacity of 170,000 m3. The site was unmanned during the silent hours but the volume at the holder was monitored by remote control from the Control Centre. The leak was caused by cracks in the fillet welds at the base of the vertical stay positions in the first lift cup. These had previously been repaired by the use of iron cement over the welds, probably at the time of construction. There was a release of natural gas over a period of 17 minutes. The escape took place above ground level as the gas holder dropped. Since natural gas is lighter than air, the main movement of the escaping gas would therefore be upwards. The gas cloud did not find an ignition source. The gas inflow to the holder and the gas outflow to the distribution system were stopped. By 08:00 am conditions at the site were back to normal. Theoretical, and also practical studies (involving an old gas holder), indicated that there was no chance of a gas flammable concentration outside the site boundaries.",

        "Accident Description": "The operator commissioned an external company to remove various pipe parts from an existing propylene line and replace them with new ones.The necessary work authorisation slips for the preparatory work were issued.The line was completely purged with nitrogen from the tank end. 13 blanking plates were positioned to isolate the line. The effectiveness of the flushing was measured.Subsequently, on 14 October 2016, cutting and welding work was carried out at several places on the line.\nChronological sequence on 17 October 2016:\nThe extended-deadline authorisation slips were handed over to the operational staff of the external company in the measurement room. A pipe bridge foreman was present at the work site in the pipeline route before work began and supervised the start of the works.\nAt the work site, a 3&nbsp;mm hole was first made in the line with a hand drill in order to check that the line was clear and safe. Control measurements using a portable gas meter were carried out to ensure that no hydrocarbon or explosive atmosphere was present.\nSeveral cuts were made and sections of pipe were removed.A localised fire broke out at around 11:20 for reasons as yet to be established.A very sooty flame could be seen.\nThe employees of the external company moved away from the danger area.The fire protection unit tried to extinguish the fire using hand-held fire extinguishers.\nThe fire brigade was alerted by the port\u2019s control station at 11:21 and arrived a few minutes later.\nShortly after the fire brigade arrived, an explosion occurred. Based on what we know so far, this was caused by a catastrophic failure of the ethylene line.\nThe impact was amplified by a section of at least 30 metres in length being ripped from its moorings and dashed towards the quay, where the first emergency services on the scene had taken up position. As a result, the fire also spread to other parts of the pipeline network and to a ship moored on the quay.\nOther lines exploded as a result of the large amount of heat generated by the underfire in the pipeline trench. This led to the release of other substances and mixtures of substances, which also ignited.\nOther firefighting units were called to assist.\nThe fire was extinguished at around 21:30 thanks to the affected pipes being shut off and to further intensive fire-fighting work. After that time, no other incident-relevant events occurred.\nSafety measures:\nAuthorisation slips, safety stations, fixed firefighting equipment, alarms, works fire brigade.",
        "Causes of the accident": "According to the results of the public prosecutor's investigations, the angle grinder cut not the propylene line to be repaired, but a neighbouring pipeline filled with a liquefied gas mixture (raffinate II). The liquefied gas mixture under pressure escaped through this cut and presumably ignited on the hot surface or sparks of the angle grinder. The burning liquid gas jet directly hit the adjacent ethylene pipeline, approximately 50&nbsp;cm away. The ethylene pipeline is operated at a pressure of approximately 90&nbsp;bar.\nIt is suspected that the direct application of heat to the ethylene pipeline led to a thermal decomposition of the ethylene, which ruptured the pipeline and caused burning ethylene to flow out. The other pipelines in the trench were then heated up and further mechanical damage to other pipelines occurred.",
        "Consequences": "Damage to property within the site:Pipelines, pipeline bridges, tanker, cars, lorries, emergency vehicles, interruption to production. Environmental damage within the site:Floor in pipeline trench.Adverse effects off site:Reports of unusual smells by persons in the area surrounding the northern port.Other disruptions off site:Traffic jams on the motorway and on the site access roads, closure of various gates.",

        "Accident Description": "Tubular protector on the electrical cable for the submerged pump in tank No. 8 was damaged during pumping thereby leading to a release of liquid chlorine from the tank.On 21.7.2000 at 07:45 there was a release of chlorine to the atmosphere as a result of an operational accident involving the chlorine tank No. 8 (TK 2.01.C) in the chlorine store, building E 4990, in the electrolysis operations, PVC plant of the company. The release reached beyond the boundary of the company. At 07:56 h a level III chemical alarm was issued. The release from the tank was stopped before 17:00 h by the fire service in cooperation with workers from the electrolysis operation. During this time 12 members of HZS were treated medically, with 10 of these being injured (inhalation, acid burn). No other workers at the plant or inhabitants of the surrounding area were harmed. The accident had no affect on the operation of the production plants.On the 21.7.2000 at 7:00 Mr Majer prepared, on the request of the head of the chlorine filling shop. Mr. Juris, the pumping of chlorine from tank 8 located in building E 4990 to an external tank. After performing the necessary manipulation and checking the operational parameters of the tank he switched on the pump in tank 8. At that point he heard a loud bang, and saw that the store was inundated with chlorine, whereby he switched off the pump. On the basis of the reaction of sensor no. 5 of the emergency monitoring system (a signal is lead to the electrolysis control panel of the operational headquarters of the fire services) at 7:49, it is possible to estimate the time of accident as approx. 7:45. Obrat informoval Mr. Juris and together dressed in protective masks they investigated what had happened. Due to the heavy inundation of chlorine Mr. Juris returned to the adjacent building for breathing equipment. He then informed Mr. Kubist, manager of the chlorine, lye and ATA production, who at 7:52 called for the fire services (extension 150). After entering the inundated storage area, Mr. Juris attempted to determine the source of the leakage. He discovered that the liquid chlorine was leaking from the top of tank 8, where the pump was located. He supposed that the chlorine delivery route from the pump was broken, as the leak occurred at the moment the pump was turned on.In difficult conditions and with minimal visibility he closed the armature of the delivery pump above the lid of the tank and opened the armature of the deaeration tank to the chlorine production. He then left the storage area and switched off the storage area ventilation system. In the meantime, Mr. Kubista activated the emergency shutdown in the sodium chloride production hall. The fire services arrived at 7:55 am. A third degree chemical alarm was sounded at 7:56 am. At this time wind direction was 278\u00b0 (westerly) and velocity was 0.5 m/s. The fire services began their investigation at 8:00 am and began to take action to limit the leakage of chlorine from the tank. At the same time, Mr. Stastny switched off the electricity in building E 4990. The tenzometric scales and pressure and temperature measurements of the chlorine tanks in the store ceased to operate. After the arrival of the fire services, Mr. Juris and Mr. Kubista briefed them on the severity of the situation and that the liquid chlorine is probably leaking from the pump's feed pipe in tank 8. In light of the fact that after closing the delivery vent of the pump the intensity of the leak did not decrease, they deduced that the pipe ruptured somewhere between the lid of the tank and the delivery armature, where there is a special steel profile.. The fire services managed, under conditions of very poor visibility and spraying liquid chlorine, to directly identify the leakage point. On the basis of the third degree chemical alarm and the information given by NES -OkU Meln\u00edk, vyhl\u00e1sil NES the warning signal \"Catastrophe\" and subsequently announced that there had been a release of chlorine at Spolena over the public relay system in the town of Tisice-Kozly at 8:32. At 8:55 the announcement was made in the towns of Vsetaty, Ovc\u00e1ry, Dr\u00edsy and again in Tisice-Kozly. At 8:40 informoval VDO zdymadla Lobkovice and Obr\u00edstv\u00ed of the accident at Spolena and requested the closure of the River Labe (Elbe), which was reopened at 18:30. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "A physical explosion in the electrical part of the pump due to a reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine. Failure of pump motor in the tank.The cause of the accident was a physical explosion in the electrical part of the pump due to a reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine, initiated by sepnut\u00ed of the electrical circuit.The explosion was preceded by penetration of liquid chlorine into the stator parts of the pump motor through a hole in the protective membrane of the stator with subsequent chemical degradation of the material and loss of the insulation properties of the conductors.A short-circuit occurred in the in the stator parts of the pump motor near the protective membrane, which was made of Hastelloa material, on the 20.7.2000, as a consequence of the loosening of several conductors, initiated by a chemical reaction with the chlorine. The protective membrane was exposed to high temperatures for a period of up to 12 seconds (time period until electrical protection reacted) and subsequently perforated. Then the electrical current was lost thereby shutting down the electrical protection. The reaction was subsequently inhibited by the impact of the presence of a large volume of liquid chlorine. Liquid chlorine entered the stator coil and protective tubing of the feed conductors through the perforation in the stator protective membrane.Due to the shutting down of the pump on the 21.7.2000 there was an electrical and temperature overload, caused by a spontaneous reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine. The sharp increase in temperature and the subsequent pressure (approx. 70 - 100 MPa) caused the explosion. The speed of the explosion cancelled out the effectiveness of the electrical protection. The upper tube of the pump motor was lifted and with a slight delay caused a pressure shock and the energy of the released gaseous chlorine caused the horizontal parts of the tubing of the feed conductors to break. Analysis of the quality of the welded joint indicated a clean break, without material defect, fatigue or corrosive damage.This resulted in the ejection of the remains of this tubing with the terminal block on the profile support of the flooring below the tank. The liquid chlorine then escaped from the tank to the collection sump no. 8.&nbsp; ",
        "Consequences": "Minor injuries to fire brigade members - 8 fire safety workers of Spolana a.s., 2 fire safety workers of Meln Off-site losses still under investigation. By 18.9.2000 there were a total of 12 demands for compensation of damages as a result of the accident (animal farming, forest and garden areas, loss of earnings) to the sum of approx. 75 mil. CZK (2.5 mill #), from which a company in Kn\u00edzec\u00ed dvur Tisice makes up approx. 74,5 mil CZK. The direct relation of these damages with the leakage of chlorine has yet to be proven.Compensation for company damages and evaluation of valid applications from the surroundings of the site will be solved in cooperation with the insurance company Ceska pojistova and other external organizations.",
        "Emergency response": "Level III chemical alarm issued at 7.56 am due to release of\nchlorine beyond the SPOLANA plant, inhabitants of surroundings advised\nto evacuate.Activity of the emergency services during the event is described in the description of the course of the accident Discussion with the regional fire council and the inspectorate of the Czech Ministry of Interior.Measures were taken on production operations downstream of the leak (LAO, EVH, KL) in conformity with the emergency plan, therefore it was not necessary to close down operational facilities. Measurements of chlorine concentrations in the atmosphere in effected areas of Spolana were taken by the fire services (8:45 LAO operation - 0.5 ppm, 8:55 Labe dock- 3 ppm). Measurements in the surroundings of the company were performed by EBS Spolana using a monitoring vehicle between 8:20 and 18:05. Measured concentrations of chlorine peaked at 0,6 mg/m3 (0.2 ppm). NES-OkU Meln\u00edk also performed measurements in the surrounding towns between 9:25 and 11:40. The highest concentrations measured were 0.1 ppm.In an attempt to limit the release of chlorine to the surroundings of building E 4990, the fire services installed water screens and used stable hasic\u00ed zar\u00edzen\u00ed on the LAO plant. At 10:16 it was discovered that a brown liquid was flowing from the outflow of channel K1 to the River Labe. The fire services installed a scumboard wall. Visual control, analysis of samples and the short-term staining of the water confirmed that a large flow of water from the water screen had rinsed the sewerage system.In order for the volume of leaking chlorine to be reduced Mr. Juris, after discussion with Mr. Fajkus and Mr. Kubista at around 9:00, decided to transfer the remaining content of tank 8 to tank 9 using the pressure of the chlorine. This however did not reduce the intensity of the chlorine leak. After approx. 60 min. the operation was stopped because the pressure in both of the tanks was presumed to be the same meaning extrusion would not continue. After 11:00 they attempted to limit the leakage by reverse air pressure to the delivery pipe of the pump and resulting back-pressure reduce the level of liquid chlorine in the delivery pipe, whereby improving the conditions under which the fire services were working to seal the leak. This was also to no avail.The activity of the fire services in building E 4990 was performed under extremely difficult circumstances (no light, whole storage area inundated in chlorine, liquid chlorine was spraying from the area of supposed leakage, freezing up of the lid). Contact with the chlorine caused damage to the protective clothing and gloves. It was necessary to regularly substitute fire services members in very short time intervals. Reinforcements were drafted from Meln\u00edk, Neratovic and Kralup n/V. At 9:14 chlorine began to flow from the pipe in building E 4890, the fire services blocked the pipe at 9:38. The activity of the fire services inside building E 4990 on tank 8 was focused on plugging the supposed source of the leak using lead tape and quick-drying cement. Each attempt to stop the leak was unsuccessful until the pressure in the tank decreased at around 16:00, and it was discovered that the chlorine was leaking from the detached safety pipe of the feed conductor of the pump motor. The fire services finally stopped the leak by plugging the orifice of the detached safety pipe with a wooden peg, just before 17:00.At 17:05 the third degree chemical alarm was withdrawn at Spolana, subsequently NES-OkU Meln\u00edk informed the residents in the surrounding towns. At 18:02 the second degree chemical alarm at the company was withdrawn.During the accident and after stopping the leak several management meetings took place to plan the necessary and immediate measures to be taken for stopping the leak and restocking of auxiliary agents. Were decided and specified further methods and activities for the decontamination of building E 4990 and tank (securing the tank for removal of the residual chlorine, provision of chlorine cisterns, methods of inspection and control in object E 4990 and its surroundings). Immediate measures were put into place - until the cause of the accident in investigated the remaining liquid chlorine pumps must not be used in the storage area.Information on the accident was relayed to the media by the company's press officer.26.7.2000 all the liquid chlorine was transferred from all of the tanks in building E4990 to the cistern. Decontamination of building E 4990, allowing entry to the building without the need for breathing apparatus was completed on 31.7.2000.On 1.8.2000 the police department performed an inspection of the site in the presence of members of the company's investigative committee. A preliminary enquiry and photo documentation was taken at the site.Decontamination of tank 8 was completed 8.8.2000. An internal inspection of the tank was performed and the pump was removed for inspection.Disassembly of the pump was performed and photo documentation was taken by the firm Neraservis in the presence of members of the committee on 9.8.2000.",
        "Lesson Learned": "-  immediate restriction on the use of submersed HERMETIC pumps for the filling of cisterns and transfer of liquid chlorine\n-  removal of the HERMETIC pumps and replace the tank lids (retract the delivery branch for the safety pipe) during the planned revision of    the individual tanks\n-  ensure that none of the pumps can be operated whilst the process of removal is under way\n-  elaboration of a study on alternative means of transferring the liquid chlorine\n\n"

        "Finish Date": "2014-03-07 17:40:00",
        "Accident Description": "An explosion occurred in a building in which nitrocellulose formulations were prepared, and recovered single-base powders crushed, for subsequent use in the process of manufacturing double-base spherical powders. (The process involves the manufacture in an aqueous medium of small spherical granules from fresh or recycled nitrocellulose prior to adding nitroglycerine.) Although the recovered powder crusher is not implicated in the accident, it was damaged as a result of the fire in the building. The formulations are made from granules recycled after sieving, crushed single-base recovered powders and fresh nitrocellulose in the form of nitrocotton fibres. To make the formulations, nitrocellulose granules of various origins, stored under water in tanks in the building where the accident occurred, are transferred between tanks in the neighbouring buildings and the tanks in this building via a network of piping fitted with centrifugal pumps. The nitrocellulose granules in the building in question are first pumped into a pycnometer tank to be weighed and then transferred to other decanting and formulation tanks located in the same building. The formulations produced in this way are then transferred, by pumping, to granulation tanks at a later stage in the production line, where they are dissolved in ethyl acetate. An explosion occurred in the transfer pump and the piping linking storage tank B5 with the pycnometer tank during the transfer of nitrocellulose granules in the medium of water between these tanks. The investigations showed that the explosion of wet single-base powder had created detonation conditions in the pump and the vertical pipes downstream of the pump. A quantity of powder estimated at between 10\u00a0kg and 30\u00a0kg was detonated in the accident. The detonation sheared open tanks B4 and B5 in the vicinity of the pump in question. Tank B5, contained granules recycled after sieving and was almost empty, spilled into a pit and the contents of tank B4, consisting of recovered powder in the form of monotubular grains, were partially discharged onto the building's concrete floor and were not involved in the explosive reaction. It is estimated that there were 6 tonnes of powder in tank B4 at the time of the explosion. The other tanks in the building and the pipe network were seriously damaged by the primary debris from the detonation of the pump and piping and by the blast wave. The explosion caused major damage to the building and threw debris out to a radius of 50 to 70\u00a0metres. Windows were broken within a radius of 100-150\u00a0metres. In the building affected, the explosion set off a fire in a store containing dry single-basis powder ready for feeding into the crusher.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The hypothesis that nitrocellulose in a water medium could burn and then detonate as a transition from combustion without being primed by another detonation was initially considered but then ruled out after testing. The detonation of the wet nitrocellulose granules must have been triggered by an initial detonation of dry material. It was concluded that the cause was a technical issue associated with the type of pump which had led to a possible temperature increase in the nitrocellulose granules after loss of prime and drainage of the pump chamber. The creation of a vortex in the tank upstream of the pump caused the pump to lose its prime, enabling the nitrocellulose granules in the pump to come back into contact with air and, in local areas, dry out. The hypothesis is that the dried powder trapped behind the pump impeller then became hot and detonated inside the pump chamber, transferring the detonation to the column of wet nitrocellulose located above the pump. The fact that the pipework upstream of the pump found after the explosion was not destroyed by an internal detonation supports the hypothesis that a vortex caused the pipes to be drained prior to the explosion. Hypotheses and deductions: 1) Vortex effect: It seems that the level of tank B5, to which the centrifugal pump was connected, was low at the time of the accident. In identical circumstances on earlier occasions operators had noticed a vortex effect at the bottom of the tank which could be the cause of air ingress into the pump, causing it to lose prime. During tests to try to recreate the circumstances of the accident, the operator noted: - a 50\u00b0C increase in the (surface) temperature of the pump within 15 minutes; - that the liquid column downstream of the pump failed to empty. Thus, since there is no longer a flow of liquid to the vertical column but only an oscillating phenomenon caused by intermittent discharge of the unprimed pump, the solid particles tend to drop to the bottom of the column, near the pump, where they form a blockage that stops liquid flowing back into the pump and keeping the product residues in the pump wet. 2) Sequence of events: It is hypothesised that the following sequence of events led to the accident: - Air ingress caused by a vortex led to the pump losing prime, obstructing the movement of the product through the pipes and a blockage forming in the column downstream, preventing liquid flowing back. The lack of liquid flow combined with the presence of air caused the pump to heat up and, in local areas, dry out the nitrocellulose. At the same time, nitrocellulose particles dropped into the column downstream of the pump. - The nitrocellulose particles inside the pump became drier in local areas, caught fire and detonated, causing a second detonation of the wet powder in the downstream piping. ",
        "Consequences": "The explosion caused serious damage to the building and threw debris out to a radius of 50 to 70 metres. Windows were broken within a radius of 100-150 metres. The explosion started a fire. Two operators who were working at the rear of the building at the time of the explosion and protected from the primary blast by a brick wall managed to escape. During evacuation, one of the two operators sustained a minor injury to the hand. Both operators were taken to hospital and were discharged to return home the same evening. ",
        "Emergency response": "The internal emergency teams intervened very quickly and started to fight the fire which broke out after the explosion. The external emergency services arrived very quickly on the scene. Set up of a post-accident crisis unit comprising the fire brigade, the police, the municipality, the Governor, civil protection, a communication unit and the competent Seveso inspection services (FPS [Federal Public Service] Economy, RAM [Major Accident Risk] cell of SPW [Service Public de Wallonie]). Clean-up work and site security operations were organised in cooperation with a French company specialised in decommissioning and dismantling pyrotechnic facilities. The situation immediately after the accident may be described as follows. - According to estimates, there were still 6 tonnes of nitrocellulose granules in the building, partially spread on the ground, plus 18 tonnes in the vertical tanks, in the pit or trapped in the piping. - On the ground floor of the building, parts of the floor were covered with nitrocellulose granules mixed with a great deal of debris and rubble. - The building had been severely damaged: only the metal structure remained and this was in very poor condition. - In the event of the remaining nitrocellulose exploding, the effects could extend beyond the site and affect people living in the neighbourhood. The following urgent action was taken: - Saturating with water (drenching) was recommended, considering the fire risk - and even explosion risk - on account of the powder remaining on the ground and in the atmosphere. To that end, an internal fire team attended continuously for 8 weeks to ensure watering. - In agreement with the authorities, a site clearance procedure has been established: Stage 1: reducing the quantity of powder spilt and hence limit the likelihood of its reacting by: - continuous daily hosing of the powder on the ground; - filling the vertical tanks with water; - monitoring of water levels; - isolation of all networks into and out of the building (overhead and underground). Stage 2: Organise the manual collection and packing of the powder spread on the ground. This has been a very gradual operation, organised per areas of a few square metres following risk assessments based on photos of the areas in question and subject to work permits. The powder is recovered using an aluminium shovel and water-filled containers. Stage 3: Securing of walls and building framework at risk of falling before further work on site. Stage 4: Drainage of tanks. Stage 5: Treatment of pipes containing powder. Stage 6: Collection of remaining waste on the ground. Stage 7: Dismantling of the building. After obtaining a technical opinion from external experts, and in agreement with the authorities, a 350\u00a0m security perimeter was set up. Local residents were evacuated during the clearing and cleaning of the industrial site commencing at noon on 13\u00a0March, 6 days after the explosion. After one week, the security perimeter could be reduced as the risk of explosion could be ruled out thanks to the safety measures put in place. Site clearing and remediation works are still ongoing three months after the explosion.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The investigation has not yet been finalised and the causes have not been fully identified. Lessons and immediate steps: Replacement of the company's electrical centrifugal pumps (40 in total) with Venturi-type pumps. Venturi pumps operate on the principle of aspiration of the fluid to be conveyed by means of negative pressure brought about by the movement of a motive fluid (water). This type of pump means that friction can be reduced and the product conveyed can be kept wet continuously since the motive fluid is water. "

        "Finish Date": "2010-06-29 01:50:00",
        "Accident Description": "At 11:15 pm, a violent and loud bursting occurs within an ammonia (NH3) synthesis unit at a SEVESO-classified nitrogenous fertiliser plant. The convex base welded to a heat-insulated, high-pressure water vapour pipe connected to catalytic reforming equipment had burst prior to ignition. The base, a 40-kg block of steel, was projected longitudinally. Inside the shop area, a walkway was ripped off its supports damaging an access ladder. The steel base crossed the ammonia confinement space 25 m further, without causing any damage, then flew over an ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land 230 m away in a parking zone for tanker cars full of ammonia awaiting shipment, which on that day happened to be empty. The water vapour, circulated at 520\u00b0C under 120 bar of pressure in the pipeline, tore apart the asbestos cement cladding on the wall located 20 m from the original rupture and escaped into the atmosphere with a load accompanying noise. The two employees present in the unit at the time cut off vapour supply to stop the sound, shut down production operations and cooled the steam reformer with nitrogen. At 11:50 pm, the plant's internal emergency plan was activated by the operator, yet he failed to sound the siren or notify neighbouring localities. Alerted by the outside noise, local residents called emergency services around midnight; first responders arrived onsite with a crew of 55 men and several utility vehicles. No intervention was required on their part. Upon hearing the vehicle sirens, some residents stepped out onto their balconies or made their way to the periphery of the plant since the municipality was unable to provide information about the ongoing incident. No victims were reported and the site's other units were not adversely affected; no operations had to be interrupted. The damaged unit was shut down for several weeks, which in turn caused shutdowns at special fertiliser production units due to the loss of vapour.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A metallurgical assessment of the base indicated that slow creep had initiated on the outer skin, which combined with flow into the material layer was the cause of pipe rupture. This hypothesis relied on the detection of oxidised, yet non-deformed, pipe openings in the presence of intergranular microcracks on both the pipe and its base. The origin of this creep was explained by the metallurgical composition of the base, i.e. ordinary carbon steel containing no alloys and not adapted to temperatures above 425\u00b0C. The pipeline was made of a slightly-alloyed P22 type steel, which was more resistant to creep and compliant with the original specifications defined 32 years prior for both material elements. Inspections carried out at the time on the convex base did not detect any noncompliance of the steel, given that non-destructive technology had not yet come of age. This creep might have been accelerated as a result of heat treatment performed at 700\u00b0C during equipment installation, once the assembly had been welded. Periodic inspections dedicated to pressurised equipment on the damaged pipe were only recorded into the log 25 years after service start-up, at the time of applying for facility recertification. The initial recertification was rendered official without any underlying structural documentation (misplaced), and subsequent inspections never focused on the section of pipe that would burst.Nine months before the accident, the in-house inspection team had requested adding the mode of \"degradation by high-pressure vapour pipe vibrations\" to the unit's pipe inspection routine, following a break in the drain valve of a high-pressure pipe when restarting operations at the unit. On the day of the accident, this mode had not been included in the inspection programme. Classified Facilities inspectors requested a materials control of all unit pipes before restarting operations; this additional step revealed 12 other noncompliant steel components (a tee junction, tap, base, flange, etc.).",
        "Consequences": "The base, a 40-kg block of steel, was projected longitudinally. Inside the shop area, a walkway was ripped off its supports damaging an access ladder. The steel base crossed the ammonia confinement space 25 m further, without causing any damage, then flew over an ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land 230 m away in a parking zone for tanker cars full of ammonia awaiting shipment, which on that day happened to be empty.

No intervention was required on their part.",
        "Lesson Learned": "---Lessons Learned drawn from the FD_38831_Le Grand Quevilly_DP_vfin_GB.pdf report ----Even though the severity of this accident remained rather mild given the absence of domino effects, several lessons can still be drawn, relative to both the causes and circumstances.As for causes, this accident highlights two significant organisational flaws :\u2022 Deficiency in the control of equipments materials at the time of unit installation. Even though material certificates were verified by an independent control body according to the operator, the steel used on the bottom and 12 other pieces of equipment was not compliant with specifications, and the original pipe construction documentation could never be found.\u2022 Incomplete traceability of pipe monitoring given that until 2003, formalisation of the steam pipe condition monitoring protocol had only been partial (restricted to unit drawings). Formalisation of monitoring procedures was not initiated before the first periodic recertification, in application of the 15 March 2000 decree, though the unit had already been operating for 25 years. Nonetheless, the French regulation relative to plant pipelines (issued on 23rd January, 1962) stipulated in Article 13 that \"the documents, drawings or diagrams, testing and retesting reports, notes from inspections prescribed in Article 12, relative to a pipeline or set of pipelines, are to be archived\u2026\".From a broader perspective, this accident stresses the difficulties found by the internal and external control entities in detecting such non-compliance in steel. As demonstrated in the inventory of all unit\u2019s pipes, this non-compliance does not represent an isolated case. It would be useful to mention that a verification of the steel quality had taken place in 1987 but was limited to those elements prone to hot hydrogen damages. Even if the initial recertification had been conducted in compliance with current regulations (without any imposed hydraulic test, no imposed exposure, original drawings forwarded to the authorised certification body), the question can still be raised whether it was reasonable to limit this verification to just the regulatory control steps in the absence of construction specifications. The organisation of these controls, shared over time among several distinct actors (internal inspection team, certified control authorities and the various external firms subcontracted to perform specific tasks), was not designed to promote efficient monitoring given the lack of rigour in their formalisation.The operator also conducted verifications on the type of materials found on the most sensitive parts of the site's other units. The local environmental authority requested an operator of similar units located just a few kilometres away to undertake the same kind of verification. Feedback was addressed at the national level to all local environmental authority offices.As regards the consequences of this accident, it can be considered that a 40-kg steel projectile propelled through an operating ammonia production unit, passing close to an NH3 receiving bottle, missing the nitric acid unit and a bulk ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land in a zone where railcars loaded with ammonia were likely to park, all while causing relatively minor property damage, lies within the realm of \u201cdivine intervention\u201d. This assessment was underscored in a letter written by the local environmental authority to the operator: \"\u2026 the caps, which are massive pieces of equipment weighing some forty kilograms, most likely crossed the most sensitive installations found in the AM2 unit, namely the R1501 bottle, to ultimately land between 2 railway lines at the location of switch 371. These elements attest to the potential seriousness of this incident\u2026\".This potential seriousness was also fully perceived by the operator, with some testimonials suggesting that some plant employees became aware of the risks related to pressurised steam. It goes without saying that the site's safety reports were focused on the most common hazardous phenomena for this kind of activity, as well as those causing potential effects outside the site boundaries, though domino effects caused by pressurised steam equipments were not included.The scenario with most third-party exposure is based on a toxic ammonia leak (up to an 8-km radius around the site).This scenario recently became more predominant in employees mind given the repetition of accidents of this type arising just a short time earlier at one of the Group's sister facilities located less than 200 km from Grand Quevilly (three months before the accident : ARIA 38959; and one year before with the evacuation of 300 employees receiving significant media attention : ARIA 36660).Besides, a flaw in the implementation of instructions issued by the internal inspection team has to be pointed out.Following the incident that occurred in October 2009, when the water hammer associated with a restart had caused the rupture of a bleed valve on one of the unit's high-pressure pipes, this team had requested that the pipe inspection plan incorporate the mode of vibration-induced degradation. Eight months later, on the day of the accident, this mode had still not been included even though it would have perhaps allowed to detect the surface defect or the onset of microcracking at the level of the weld (had for example a magnafluxing inspection been carried out on the suspected weld).On the other hand and despite the communication efforts engaged by the site operator and authorities over major accidents behaviour in the past few years, this potentially serious outcome has gone unnoticed by all neighbours. Several local residents actually went onto their balconies to observe the actions of fire-fighters, while others walked up to the site boundary even though safety guidelines called for residents to remain indoors.In defence of local residents, the operator's decision to activate the internal emergency plan would have alerted them to the potential seriousness of the incident. Instead, the operator waited for 50 minutes before triggering this emergency plan jointly with the municipality and local authorities. Fire-fighters were notified well before this period, but this notification came from local residents calls, and fire-fighting crews were unaware of the exact situation when they arrived at 11:30 pm in front of the site. Moreover, the decision made at 11:15 pm not to activate the emergency siren on the grounds of an absence of toxic leaks only further sparked the curiosity of some residents upon hearing the leaking steam noise between 11:07 and 11:27 pm, inciting them to get closer to the site. In reality, the operator could not have been completely certain of the absence of toxic leaks until around 12:18 am, after the second inspection of the damaged unit and negative controls of air toxicity around the site. A final inspection of the unit with authority representatives was even considered necessary at 1:15 am to remove any lingering doubts.Alerting local residents and requesting them to remain indoors, even if not really necessary, would have provided the added benefit of reminding residents that a major accident can occur and would have tested their ability to apply correctly the preventive guidelines.In conclusion, the operator was late in informing local emergency response teams and neighbouring municipalities, which were unable to notify individuals with information regarding the accident, a shortcoming that further incited the inappropriate reaction of some residents. And yet the plant's locality happened to be one of the few in France to be equipped with an automated call system to quickly and simultaneously alert residents living near the site."

        "Causes of the accident": "The fire was originated due to a defective fluorescent tube in a suspended intermediate ceiling on the second floor of the building concerned. A short circuit exposed the exhaust air pipe (above the defective fluorescent tube), linked to the  ventilation system of the equipment, to thermal stress. The energy released by the catalytic reaction of Pt-, Pd-, Rh- salts/dust deposits in the exhaust air pipe set the whole pipe on fire. The exhaust air ventilator on fifth floor pulled the fire upstairs overriding the fire dampers.On 06/07/00 a fire occurred in an intermediate ceiling of the second floor of the installation in question.The professional fire brigade and the onsite firefighting service were notified at the same time. The fire was extinguished rapidly and was declared extinguished.During the subsequent control smoke was detected at the door on the second floor leading to the ventilation shaft. After opening the door it appeared that a fire was spreading rapidly towards the ventilation control station in the fifth floor.On the roof of the five storey building the openings of the ventilation system are located.In the north-eastern zone of the building (contact area with the neighbouring building) the development of strong smoke was detected. The smoke cloud was approximately 150-300 m high and shifted slowly towards north-east (an industrial park area).Measurements were performed around 07:25. The measurements were focused on the detection of&nbsp;&nbsp; HCN, HCL, and ammonia gases in the immediate surroundings of the burning building. All measurements were negative.On request of the Environmental Protection Agency (Umweltbundesamt), the measurements were repeated at 08:25. The measurements at the adjoining industrial park resulted in a HCL gas concentration of 20 ppm. The ERPG-2 threshold limit was therefore exceeded and the D3-notification level was released. Due to the wind direction, at no stage was the population exposed to risk. However, there was a health hazard for the employees of the industrial park, due to the high HCL gas concentration.The fire was under control around 10:00 hrs, at 11:15 hrs it was extinguished. The D3-notification level was called off at 11:30 hrs.",

        "Finish Date": "1990-11-22 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "On 22 11 90 at about 11.00 the opening of a safety valve at DSM's nitric acid plants caused release of a certain amount of nitrous gases into the atmosphere. This emission did not endanger the environment as was subsequently confirmed by the measured values. Nevertheless, the Limburg Region (Belgium) was greatly alarmed by this accident. BRT and Limburg Broadcasting Stations advised the population to stay indoor and to keep windows and doors closed until further notice. These instructions are in-line with the regulations in force and are directly resulting from the information provided by DSM to the Regional Alarm Centers: \"gas leaks that may endanger the population\".This communication immediately triggered the application of a civil defence program. DSM should said instead \"gas leak without risk for the population. The regional fire brigade in The Netherlands soon became aware that the population on the Dutch side of the frontier was not alarmed. The Limburg Region in Belgium had meanwhile started its civil defence program that could not be interrupted. A crisis-center was organized in Hasselt were they preferred a certainty to an uncertainty. ADSM expert was called in for scientific measurements of the air but no measured value indicated an increased nitrous gas concentration at living level. At about 4.00 p.m. all special warnings for the population were cancelled. DSM received scores of telephone calls from citizens who had been alarmed by the radio broadcast. No mention was made of any damage to persons or property.",
        "Causes of the accident": "It was found that the accident was due to faulty operation of a safety equipment (safety valve). Built in safety was triggered too soon due to defective auxiliary control. 100% fail-safe operation cannot be achieved in practice.",
        "Consequences": "No mention was made of any damage to persons or properties. The emission of nitrous gases did not endanger the environment as it was subsequently confirmed by the measurement values. DSM calculated the spreading hazard for various zones based upon the expected concentration rate. Measurements confirmed these calculated values (0.5-ppm at living level). In the accident about 500 kg was released into the atmosphere in about 2.5 minutes which is actually the maximum permissible emission before the safety device is triggered.",
        "Emergency response": "- Information by DSM to the Regional Alarm Centres: \"Gas leaks that may endanger the&nbsp;&nbsp; population\"- Triggering of the application of civil defence program- Dutch defence program did not alarm Dutch population- the near Belgian/Limburg Region started civil defence program that could not be&nbsp; interrupted- Crisis center organized in Hasselt- No indication (measured values) of increased nitrous gases at living level- at 4.00 p.m all warnings cancellation",
        "Lesson Learned": "DMG disassembled the auxiliary control system and the plant operates at a lower pressure. A coupled safety system (interlock) was chosen for the future, because it will automatically trim combustion as soon as the safety device is triggered; blow-down time is thus shortened to about 30 seconds. It should be determined how to report in writing such events to the Province Authorities. It was agreed that the Belgian Authorities would be as soon as possible informed about any unusual events that might lead to trouble, harmful effects or danger in Belgian border region. Prompter information should also timely be given to the province and nearby municipalities. The Authorities will also timely be informed in an explanatory CCo about the DSM protection program to be implemented in case of accidents."

        "Start Date": "1997-06-19 02:20:00",
        "Finish Date": "1997-06-19 05:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Fire in a lubricating oil plant which started in a heat exchanger. \nThe accident was reported to ATRIG, the same day, by phone, luckily there was never the risk that the accident scenario could evolve by involving  other process units of the installation or that it could reach outside the Refinery.wind intensity higher than normal for that period of the year, causing the dispersion of the product originating from the leak (release), towards the interior of the unit.Discussion about occurrence:Durig the shift which started at 22:00 h of the 18/06/97 and which finished at 6:00 h of the 19/06/97, Unit 2000 of the lubricating oil plant was in start-up phase (condition), after having been shut-down for scheduled maintenance work.The accident started (originated) in the heat exchanger E 2007 B, when that unit in which the heat exchanger is integrated was very near to reach normal operating conditions. It was foreseen that at the end of that shift the unit would have reached normal operating conditions.When the accident occurred, at&nbsp; 02:20 h of 19/06/1997,&nbsp; unit 2000 was at the final start-up stage, it remained&nbsp; only to introduce rectification vapour in column T 2002, raise the temperature to normal operating values in furnaces H 2001 and H 2002,&nbsp; the feed (charge) of crude oil was of 90 m3/h (cubic metres an hour), the crude oil exiting from H 2001 had a temperature of 320\u00b0C and the residues exiting from H 2002 had approx.the same temperature. Distillation products were collected already in both columns and were to be deviated through slops until information on the quality of the product was obtained.Until the accident everything had been going on normally. Attention must be drawn to the fact, that after the shut-down of the unit and the performance of major maintenance operations it is normal that minor leaks (releases) occur in equipment, the leaks are eliminated by tightening the fastening (fixing) elements. This is the reason why&nbsp; in those circumstances the start-up of the units is performed slower in order to allow the detection of possible (eventual) anomalies (disturbances), avoiding that these present a significant risk.In fact the start up was to be slow, for the reasons indicated above, moreover there had been&nbsp; a certain delay due to a leak which occurred in heat exchanger E 2001, which led to the reduction of the discharge. The introduction of the pipes of the heat exchangers in the respective (corresponding) bodies was made with the help of cradles in order to&nbsp; avoid forcing or deforming the equipment, and thus to damage it.The inspection services made a hydrostatic test on the heat exchanger (at a pressure of 37 kg on the body and 24 kg on the pipes, during one hour) after it had been assembled; according to the results of the acceptance test there had been no need of re-tightening.An operator of&nbsp; Unit 2000 detected the leak (release) which was at the origin of the accident; while he was putting into operation one burner of the furnace H 2002 he saw a very large cloud inside that unit, originating in the upper part (top) of one of the connection joints between the body and the primary chamber (antechamber) of the heat exchanger E 2007B, on the north side. The release assumed the form of a fan and pushed by the wind, which was blowing strongly, it moved towards column T 2005. The detection of the leak (release) occurred between 02:15 h and 02:20 h and was immediately communicated to the control room. At 02:20 the product originating from the leak (release) ignited (took fire) in the area corresponding to the pumps P 2008&nbsp; A and B. The fire expanded rapidly in direction of column T 2005, reaching the base of D 2002.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The fire started in the heat exchanger E 2007 B, when the unit in which it is integrated (part of)  was reaching (very near to reach) normal operation conditions, after that maintenance work had been performed during a scheduled shut-down.\nA leak (release) of product occurred through one of the joint seals (gaskets)  linking (connecting)  the body to the primary chamber (antechamber), the released product (ignited) took fire.",
        "Consequences": "Material losses were limited to a small area of one of the two units of the lubricating oil plant,  losses are quantified at approx. 1,1 million Euros including reconstruction and recovery.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "The Onsite Emergency Plan was activated, the operations were also supported by four voluntary fire brigades of the region.During the extinguishing operations fire hoses, fix monitors (mounted extinguishers), water curtains with sprinklers, and fire-fighting vehicles were used, employing as extinguishing agents foam and powder&nbsp; and water as cooling agent in order to avoid the risk of re-ignition, after having extinguished the fire.Apart from measures directly linked to the extinguishing operations some water curtains were set-up (created, put into place) in order to avoid as far as possible the diffusion (expansion) of the fire.The fire was considered as extinguished at 05:00:00.Emergency measures - Remarks: The shift leader gave the alarm by activating a alarm button, located on road M.The signal \"emergency in the lubricant oil plant\", reached the Security Communication Centre immediately after a phone call which signalled a leak (release) in E 2007 B.Immediately an operator of the security service, which was responsible fo communications, activated the general alarm and communicated, by radio, to all members of the Security Service, that there was an emergency in Unit 2000. After the beginning of the fire the operator at he control panel shut down the furnaces and separated (isolated) the loading (charging) FICVs (2002 A/B and 2002 A/B) of those two furnaces. The control panel operator moved to the Battery Limits of units 2000 and 2100, where he succeeded in shutting (cutting, closing)&nbsp; the crude oil charging valve&nbsp; of the unit. Afterwards he closed (shut, cut) in the Battery Limits the valves of Unit 6100 and of the the slops.An operator of Unit 2000 moved to to the Battery Limits with the goal to close the gas valve and all other valves, in order to isolate the unit.A fix monitor (mounted extinguisher) placed in the room was put into service in order to protect the accumulator D 2004.Approx. 3 or 4 minutes after the fire started, the shift electrician closed down the electric supply in the corresponding substation.Meanwhile all other units of the lubricating oil plant were shut down.When the Communication Control Room received information on \"emergency in Unit 2000\" , the general alarm and the onsite emergency plan were activated.When the emergency response vehicles reached the place, immediately the emergency response co-ordinator (shift leader of the security service) started with the strategic disposition of human and material emergency response resources, integrating in the emergency response team also all the personnel of the unit&nbsp; not needed for emergency process control measures.The collaboration of the voluntary fire-brigade of Matosinhos-Le\u00e7a was also requested through the direct telephone line, which has been set up between the Communication Control Room and their headquarters. The intervention of the voluntary fire-brigade, which responded to the request for support, was coordinated by the emergency response coordinator and can be summarised essentially in measures for cooling the equipment located in the area involved by the fire with the goal to avoid possible ruptures (failures) due to heat radiation of ( the heat emitted by) the fire.During the extinguishing operations fire hoses, fix monitors (mounted extinguishers), water curtains with sprinklers, and fire-fighting vehicles were used, employing as extinguishing agents foam and powder&nbsp; and water as cooling agent in order to avoid the risk of re-ignition, after having extinguished the fire.Apart from measures directly linked to the extinguishing operations some water curtains were set-up (created, put into place) in order to avoid as far as possible the diffusion (expansion) of the fire.The fire was considered as extinguished at 05:00:00. The cooling operations of the equipment were maintained until the emergency response coordinator ordered to send the signal of the end of the emergency , after having inspected the entire area of the accident.All products, in liquid phase, deriving from the fire fighting measures, were collected by the drainage system for oily waters, and were conducted through it towards the waste water treatment plant of the refinery.",

        "Accident Description": "A gas explosion followed by a fire occurred at a pilot plant of a factory producing raw materials of plastics. The accident occurred while two operators were removing a reactor outlet valve which was jammed. The reactor contained propane that was discharged and caught fire. The flames caused severe burns to two maintenance operators. One of them died a few days later.On the day of the accident the reactor in question was shut down because of sudden build up of pressure. This was caused by a clogged outlet valve in the reactor. Two operators had prepared for maintenance work by flushing the reactor with nitrogen gas. When this had been completed twice and the reactor was considered to be free of pressure, it was decided to open the clogged valve. The accident occurred during opening. The reactor contained propane which was then discharged and caught fire. The resulting flames caused severe burns to two nearby operators. One of the operators who was severely injured died as a result and the other was injured.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Following investigation of the accident, several causative factors became apparent as the reason for this accident: 1) Because the product tank was full it caused the clogging of the reactor outlet valve. 2) The two manual valves, opened in the flushing of a gasket of the reactor circulation pump, were left open and thus caused a flow of propane into the reactor. In an emergency shut down situation, the automation of the system closes all propane inlet valves and opens a dump valve which leads to a flare.",
        "Consequences": "One operator died and another was injured due to serious burns. Material losses were mostly burned cables, insulation materials and instrument lockers.Affected Area: installation",

A medical helicopter and an ambulance were called out for the transportation of the injured operators.Official action taken - legal action: None based on the Seveso legislation.Official action taken - other official action: Some prerequisites are required to improve the technical system.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: In order to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, the following recommendations were made by the accident investigation group: 1) The programming of an automation system involving propane inlet valves should be altered so that the valves can not open automatically.2) A level detection alarm should be installed on the product tank. 3) All instructions should be rechecked and any changes should thoroughly be familiar to staff. 4) A check list should be created as a fundamental tool for operators to be followed. With the help of a checklist they can ensure that all the relevant operations in different duties are correctly and sequentially be executed. 5) Valves might be grouped and possibly marked with colours. Therefore process state can be clearly seen as valves would be clearly identified."

        "Accident Description": "Due to the failure of a joint on a Schenk filter, there was a release of a significant quantity (approximately 5 tonnes) of material, known as Quatmass Extraction Solution. This material contained Reglone, and approximately 2 tonnes of Ethylene Dibromide, both of which are toxic. A batch of Reglone product was being manufactured and had reached the filtration stage. Production had been normal up to this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;The batch&nbsp;was sent from the reactor vessel to the Schenk filter under 6 barg pressure, and the usual sequence is that when the vessel is empty the pressure drops and the pressure indicator in the Schenk filter senses this and sends a message to the process control computer to open the nitrogen valve. The nitrogen is then introduced under pressure to drive the filtration.On this occasion the automated nitrogen valve opened, but the nitrogen pressure did not rise&nbsp;above 2 barg, and a message was sent to the process control computer stating 'Pressure slow in rising'. The operator did not notice this for&nbsp;about 45 minutes due to other duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not an alarm.When the operator&nbsp;saw the message, he sent another operator out to investigate, and he saw that there had been a loss of containment and the batch material had been released through the flange connected to the pressure relief valve. It ran down the side of the vessel, through the lagging and into the site drains.The gasket was protruding through the side of the flange and it is thought it had been blown out when the nitrogen was put on to the filter unit.The joint had been broken at the shutdown about 6 months previously, but the unit had been in operation since then handling around 20 batches per week. The filter unit, and a second&nbsp;identical one, were installed 20 years ago.The main causes for the&nbsp;failure were around the loss of compression on the joint faces and the subsequent displacement of the gasket. The most likely causes were; 1) The use of bolts / studs with different tensile strength causing uneven stretching of the bolts in the flange joint;2) The machined surface finish on the safety valve flange face is not to the correct specification;3) External loading on the joint caused by unsupported pipe work;4) Inherent vibration in the Schenk.The most significant deficiency was considered to be inadequate floor and filter mountings. Carcinogenic material (EDB) released from the filter and collected in the site drains. It was subsequently diverted to the site emergency containment tanks. Due to errors causing delays at the site effluent treatment plant, some effluent was sent to Yorkshire Water, rather than kept on site. Yorkshire Water has since verbally confirmed their samples showed no indication of a consent breach.Remedial action taken: Repairs were carried out to support the Schenk filter and improvements made to flange integrity. Further work was undertaken to investigate vibration as a direct result of operational procedures (such as the backwash procedure which was highlighted as being different to what the filtration consultant expected). &nbsp; Root Cause Analysis undertaken by Syngenta identified a number of further operational and engineering improvements. These were implemented during plant outages in October and November 2010 and included: - Redesign of the filter backwash system - Installation of pressure differential instruments to monitor filter performance - Installation of two accelerometers which continuously monitor vibration and will trip the filter spin sequence at predetermined levels. - Filter refurbishment &nbsp; To ensure the equipment is maintained to standard additional engineering routines have been introduced including specific checks of the support legs &amp; plinths, joint integrity and bolt torque.

The flexible hose hit several small pipes and one employee standing nearby.\nDue to the broken pipework there was a release of hydrogen and butene for about five minutes.\nSprinkler systems were activated, no ignition occurred.\n\nAn explosion could have destroyed the entire polymerisation unit.",
        "Causes of the accident": "De-blocking of a cooler was done by using water at high pressure, but with great difficulties. During the day, a nitrogen feed had been temporarily opened out of fear for an explosive atmosphere in the receiving tank-truck. When the water pressure was put on the system again, a nitrogen plug was probably compressed. When the blockage released, the plug was ejected with great velocity, causing the connected flexible hose to move violently.",

        "Causes of the accident": "The strainer was inappropriately used as a filter and had to be cleaned on a fairly regular basis. This was done by removing the lid on the down-side of the strainer and 'cleaning' the filter in the strainer. Afterwards the lid has to be replaced.Causes:- inappropriate use of bolts. Some of them were heavily corroded and damaged and not fit for this particular use (different length and type of wire)- expertise of operators of the production section who performed the maintenance was inadequate. No clear references for the quality of the bolts were available.- supervision of the quality of first line maintenance is inadequate- no procedure or instruction for the cleaning operation- production organisation was not adequately aware of the risks involved with this kind of action- use of a strainer as a process filter is not appropriate. The strainer had to be cleaned on a weekly or even daily basis. This risk was not identified, neither in the design nor in the repair phase.- it could not be ascertained that a risk study has been performed before placing the strainer in 94/95 as would be required by the MOC (management of change).",
        "Consequences": "Only release. No fire, explosion (though it could have happened) or injuries. 3500 kg C1-C5 which was emitted has obviously had some effect on the atmosphere. Beside the production loss due to shut down, there has been no material loss.",
        "Emergency response": "The installation was taken out of operation immediately after detection. Operations and (company) fire brigade have blocked several valves, stopping the leakage. Actions of company fire brigade and available equipment was effective. Sprinklers automatically activated and the fire brigade  used a water gun to mix the vapour-fluid mixture. Drains were filled with foam to block gas release.",

After that, around 125 Kg of Adipic acid (CAS 124-04-9) was introduced. Rapidly, an unwanted decomposition reaction began, starting in the mixer and, through the worm screw, spreading to the hopper charged with 1,000 Kg of &nbsp;Sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate (CAS 51580-86-0). In four and a half minutes the whole facilities were afected by a white dense smoke cluod, likely made of chlorine and derivates. It was the first time this perfume was used on an industrial scale.",

        "Accident Description": "Following an internal leak, phosphorus trichloride and methane passed through a heat exchanger in the steam heat circulation system (steam) and flowed into a condensate collecting tank.Here the phosphorus trichloride hydrolysed into phosphoric acid (H3PO3). This disproportionated slightly on heating above approx. 100\u00b0 C and phosphine was formed. This escaped from the collecting tank via the air vent pipe and immediately combusted.Because of the methane that had likewise entered the condensate collecting tank, the fire spread to the plastic ducts of the air extractor fan.Owing to the increasing pressure in the collecting tank, this could no longer be removed via the air vent pipe, and the syphon of the collecting tank emptied into a reception pit in the production building.This resulted in phosphine and the contained methane being released from the syphon pipe, which ignited and set on fire the building's waste air duct, made of highly flammable polypropylene, close to the reception pit.The fire then spread along the entire waste air duct.&nbsp;Procedures were followed in accordance with the company\u2019s alarm and hazard prevention plan (BAGAP) for the plant protection products facility and the corresponding plan of the chemical park.- Alert issued to the plant's fire service, and other fire services were also contacted.- Removal of production waste water and fire-fighting and surface water to a water-treatment plant;- Central Command notified, D3 notification, broadcasting in the chemical park, alerting with the use of sirens, press releases, environmental measurements, etc.",

        "Finish Date": "2019-01-07 14:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "On 7 January 2019, at around 11:10 a.m., a substance leaked in the tank store of a production plant. The leak occurred from a pipeline between a storage container in the tank store and the production plant.\nThe substance that leaked was oleum 65%. This is concentrated sulfuric acid in which sulfur trioxide is dissolved. The substance reacts violently with water, causes severe chemical burns and can irritate the respiratory tract. Due to the cold, wet weather conditions, a fog formed around the site of the leak. The wind speed was about 0.2 m/s, so the fog occurred only in the vicinity of the leak site.\nAt around 10:45, the transfer of oleum from a railway tank wagon began. For this operation, a vehicle of the on-site fire brigade is on standby at the transfer point in order to be able to intervene immediately in the event of any leakage. For this reason, the leak, which was not linked to the unloading operation, was quickly detected and remedial action was taken immediately. After the leak was detected, the transfer process was stopped and damage limitation measures started.\nThe site fire brigade was alerted and precipitated the fog with several fire monitors and water curtains. The competent authorities (professional fire brigade, Darmstadt Regional Council, police and waterway police) were informed of the event by fax at 11:28. In this report, the event was classified as reporting level D 2 (impacts outside the factory boundaries cannot be ruled out). In addition, the Frankfurt professional fire brigade was asked to assist. Using additional water monitors, it supported the factory fire brigade in precipitating the fog. A total of five water monitors, one extinguishing support vehicle and three water curtains were used.\nIn parallel with the on-site operation, a team was set up in the Site Situation Centre to provide coordinated information for the press and to advise the public via a helpline. Representatives of the Frankfurt professional fire brigade and the police were also present in this team.\nAt 11:51 a.m., the reporting level was increased to D 3 (risk likely or already present outside the factory boundaries) due to the emergence of a light wind and the public was warned by the sirens installed at the plant. Staff in neighbouring warehouses were instructed to vacate their premises.\nMost of the water used to precipitate the leak was collected in the tank storage facility\u2019s collection area. Water that fell outside the collecting basin entered a sewer via the surface drainage system, which drains into the municipal sewer. The outlet to the municipal sewer was shut and the water was thus retained on site. After analyses showed no pH change and no significant sulfate contamination, the water was pumped from the collecting basin and sewer to the site\u2019s biological waste water treatment plant via the chemical waste collecting system.\nThe firm drained the contents of the pipeline in question into a storage container and the pipe was rinsed with sulfuric acid. This made it possible to stop the fog formation at around 13.00. It was established that the leak occurred at a pressure measuring device. After the fog formation ceased, staff of the site fire brigade wearing chemical protective suits replaced the defective measuring instrument with a new device. The subsequent pressure test of the pipe confirmed that the installation was leak-tight.\nAfter the successful pressure test, the professional fire brigade gave the all-clear via the sirens at 14:27 and ended the operation. A total of 26 on-site fire brigade and 55 professional fire brigade staff took part in the deployment.\nIn the course of the operation, the footbridge passing through the plant near the tank storage facility and the road to the north of the plant were closed by the police.\nThe environmental monitoring team of the Frankfurt professional fire brigade carried out measurements of air in and around the plant during the release of the substance and after the leak had ended. None of the measurements detected a concentration hazardous to health.\nRepresentatives of the Darmstadt Regional Government Office and fire safety inspectorate enquired by telephone and on site about the event and the measures taken.\nIt was estimated that no more than 100 kg of sulfur trioxide had leaked.\nDuring the deployment, there were no reports of injuries within the plant either among staff or among firefighters. However, the response team received one report of a child developing a cough outside the plant.\nOn 8 January 2019, the Darmstadt Regional Government Office and the Criminal Police enquired about the event. In the course of these discussions it was agreed, amongst other things, that the defective component would be sent to the manufacturer in order to determine the cause of the defect.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A subsequent examination of the defective pressure measuring device revealed that the membrane that seals the measuring instrument off from the product space was defective and thus the substance escaped into the environment. The measuring equipment was installed in May 2016 and tested on 22 November 2017 as part of the testing of the pipeline in accordance with the Industrial Safety Ordinance.",
        "Consequences": "Release of sulfur trioxide (100 kg). During the deployment, there were no reports of injuries within the plant either among staff or among firefighters. However, the response team received one report of a child developing a cough outside the plant.",
        "Emergency response": "See Accident Description.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Have a vehicle of the on-site fire brigade on standby at the transfer point in order to be able to intervene immediately and take remedial action quickly in the event of any leakage.

        "Accident Description": "During the start-up of a Crude Distillation Unit at a Refinery Manufacturing Complex after a major shutdown, a build-up of liquid hydrocarbon (Naphtha light ends) from the main distillation column process was allowed to enter a furnace which was sufficiently warm to ignite the hydrocarbon causing a slow back flame causing an internal explosion estimated at approximately 60 mbar. The explosion caused the failure of the furnace walls and its base, and subsequent fires at the base of the furnace as hydrocarbon continued to be released until the unit was shut down; there were no injuries and the incident appeared to be contained within the unit without any environmental impact. Whilst, there were no actual injuries, access was normally required both on and under the affected furnace, and therefore there was the potential for fatal injuries of one or more operators. Damage to the furnace has been estimated at a cost of \u00a34 million pounds for the furnace demolition phase and \u00a39 million for the furnace construction phase.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Flammable hydrocarbon material (Naphtha) was released into the vacuum column furnace on Crude Distillation Unit when it was shutdown &amp; subsequently ignited leading to an internal explosion within the Furnace. &nbsp;which caused the furnace walls to be pushed out and the floor of the furnace to collapse onto the working space beneath the furnace, which led to subsequent fires at the base of the furnace as hydrocarbon continued to be released until brought under control. Liquid Naphtha had overflowed from the column into the furnace, despite there being an overflow trip valve, because there was a bypass line and manual valve which bypassed the feed line on the column, and it had not been recognised that that this manual valve had to be in the shut position to ensure the column did not continue to fill, even when the high trip was activated. As a result liquid Naphtha was directed into the furnace rather than to the high level vent to atmosphere; the manual valve had also recently been replaced.",
        "Consequences": "Crude Distillation Unit was written off; COMAH major accident reportable to the EU under schedule 7 of COMAH, as the incident led to more than 2 million Euros damage to property within the establishment.\nThere were no injuries or environmental loss as a result of the incident, however, access under the furnaces was routinely required during start-ups giving rise to the risk of severe or fatal injuries of up to three persons who were working on the unit.",
        "Emergency response": "The site has an on-site emergency response capability with its own fire &amp; rescue appliances; these attended the fire almost immediately and crews had extinguished the fire within 15 minutes; the local external emergency responders also attended the scene in support and they departed the site after approximately 2hrs.",
        "Lesson Learned": "There were -\n\nfailings to ensure that when the manual by-pass valve had been replaced that the replacement valve was of the same specification as the valve replaced, or that it had the same failure modes \u2013 as a result the liquid Naphtha was able to be directed into the furnace rather than to the high level vent ;&nbsp;\nfailings to ensure when installing a high level trip and isolation to prevent overfilling column C206, that its management of change procedure (including HAZOP) would be sufficiently robust to identify the column bypass line and manual valve (which could defeat the overfill protection system);\nfailings to ensure control room operators were provided with suitable information, instruction and training to ensure they could recognise the pre-incident indicators - clear indications that the system was not operating as expected were ignored and the opportunity to investigate the cause was missed.\n"

        "Causes of the accident": "The cause for the wrong dosage and the wrong reaction was a failure of the transfer pump (component failure), which pumps the initial product from the storage tank into the mixing vessel. The measuring instrumentation indicated clearly the absence of the initial substance (correct indication), but the employee in charge with operating the installation only recorded the circumstance without taking the necessary actions (human error of omission, took no action).",

        "Accident Title": "Overflow of a twin tanks propylene oxide storage installation caused by manual error during tanker delivery",
        "Start Date": "1987-09-24 15:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "1987-09-24 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The manufacturing plant was being supplied from one previously-filled twin tank whilst the parallel twin tank was receiving the last of the tanker delivery. The tank in use had been re-pressurised with nitrogen to 2 barg whilst the tank being filled had been re-pressurised as usual to 0.35-0.7 barg and its vent valve set partly open to vent displaced nitrogen to atmosphere. During the change-over between tanks, the operator omitted to shut off the bottom outlet valve of the tank now receiving so that when he opened up the bottom outlet valve of the twin tank now supplying the plant he established in error a direct open connection between the twin tanks via the 1\" diameter bottom outlet manifold. Owing to the differential tank pressures, propylene oxide from the full tank flowed into the vented tank in addition to current inflow from the delivery tanker. In consequence the vented tank overfilled until propylene oxide overflowed from the elevated vent. Escape did not stop when the tanker driver in attendance shut off the delivery from the tanker since transfer via the open outlet manifold between tanks continued. Escape was only halted when the returning process operator shut off the tank vent and, on realizing his error, the bottom outlet valve. The escape ran down the elevated vent pipework and structure alongside and partly into the bund of the neighbouring ethylene oxide storage tank installation. The operator sensibly opened the ethylene oxide installation water drenches to dilute and wash the spillage to drain and ethylene oxide bund dilution sump. Fortunately there was no fire and the incident was contained.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:1- The propylene oxide storage installation was entirely manually controlled so that incorrect setting (or passing) of a valve could result in mis-direction or mis-transfer of bulk material between the tanks. Though tanks overloading was a routine possibility as 18 tonnes road tankers deliveries have to be split between at least two tanks (capacity only 12 or 14 tonnes), no hardware safeguarded against overfilling was foreseen . This has been recently recognised by the Company during assessment for purposes of the CIMAH regulation: the consequent intention was to fit tank high level alarms.2) Staffing and supervision of the plant was inadequate. It had become customary to expect or allow plant operators to keep a check on process plant whilst overseeing tanker deliveries. Any delay on either job meant temporary neglect of the other. In view of the total lack of automatic safeguards continuous operator presence was essential and there should have been a clear rule that there was continuous attendance throughout all propylene oxide delivery and other transfers. This did not happen in practice and the Standard Operating Procedures though fairly detailed were not clear on this point though requiring the plant operator to 'observe the level rise in the receiving tank ... so as not to exceed 80% maximum ...'. Suspension of transfer if the operator has to leave the installation was not laid down.3) Line supervisors were insensitive to the obvious staff shortage on the day of the incident. The out-going supervisor should not have allowed unsupervised delivery to continue during shift change and the oncoming supervisor should likewise have suspended delivery operations or given/arranged adequate support for the lone shift operator. Such decision should not have been left to the operator himself who would feel in danger of criticism for causing delay.",
        "Consequences": "OTHER:No material losses occurred except the escaped propylene oxide.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The operator, when detected the propylene oxide release, closed the bottom outlet valve and opened the water drenches of the ethylene oxide storage tank installation to dilute and wash the spillage to the drain and ethylene oxide bund dilution sump. The works fire brigade and other emergency services were not activated as the accident did not escalate.Emergency measures - Remarks: The propylene oxide escape was halted when the process operator, after he returned to the storage installation, shut-off the tank vent and closed the bottom outlet valve (code 7999). After, he opened the water drenches of the ethylene oxide storage tank installation to dilute and wash away the spillage to the drain and ethylene oxide bund dilution sump (code 7102). Subsequently, he informed the drains/effluent system management of (diluted) release to drain. The works fire brigade and the other emergency services were not called as the accident did not escalate (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, both on-site and off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "No additional measures internal or external to the establishment were\nnecessary. Existing on-site fire brigade, control room, communications,\nemergency planning &amp; operation etc. considered adequate to cope\nwith and alleviate the so far as reasonably practicable the possible\nworst outcome of this accident. Existing on-site and off-site emergency\nplans and also local development plan and consultation arrangements not\nsignificantly affected by the possible worst outcome of this accident.\nMeasures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- fitting of high-level alarms and trips to propylene oxide tanks (ethylene oxide tanks were already overflow-protected);\n2- modification/interlocking of propylene oxide tank valves to prevent ungoverned propylene oxide transfers between manifold tanks;\n3- improvement of staffing, supervision and instruction of plant personnel, including in particular: immediate requirement for continuous presence of an operator during all deliveries and bulk transfers; consideration of staffing particularly if delivery/ transfer is to continue during shift changeovers; revision of existing written Standard Operating Procedures to include the point mentioned above.Measures to mitigate consequences: No additional measures internal or external to the establishment were necessary. Existing on-site fire brigade, control room, communications, emergency planning &amp; operation etc. considered adequate to cope with and alleviate the so far as reasonably practicable the possible worst outcome of this accident.

        "Accident Description": "At 16:15 an explosion occurred followed by a fire in a 370 m\u00b3 detarrer in the gas treatment area at a coking plant. The extractors were activated manually. The operator activated the internal emergency plan at 16:25. The staff were evacuated. A security perimeter was established. The fuel supply to the installation was shut off. The heating of the batteries was stopped. At 20:00 the fire was extinguished by inerting with nitrogen. The weakened structure was at risk of collapse. At 20:30 the upstream and downstream valves on the detarrer and H2S scrubber were closed, coke oven gas was restored, nitrogen was injected into the gas collector and the structure was assessed. The operator installed solid joints on flanges to isolate the detarrers and the H2S scrubber.\nAccording to the operator, no hazardous or polluting material was released into the atmosphere apart from the (limited) smoke from the fire. The operator estimates the maximum amount of material that reacted in the explosion of the detarrer at 170 kg TNT equivalent. Crude coke gas from coal distillation was burnt in the bleeders (flares above oven batteries) for almost 5 days, which was the time it took to return to service the gas treatment (the detarrer that was destroyed and the H2S scrubber were isolated from the coke gas treatment system and remained out of service for several months). The estimated volume of coke oven gas sent to the bleeders is 3,776,600 Nm\u00b3.\nCoke gas was then flared for 90 days until the detarrer was replaced.\nIn total, the operator estimates that 36,790 t of coke oven gas was released and burned via the bleeders and then the flares. A health impact assessment was carried out and the SO2 emissions were modelled \u2013 according to the operator this is the only pollutant from combustion that could affect the public. The operator concludes that neither the daily average limit value for the protection of human health, the information and recommendation threshold nor the alert threshold were exceeded.\nFollowing the incident, the damage to outlet valves and pipes was analysed. The work to rebuild the detarrer lasted several months. The material losses are estimated at EUR 10 million and production losses at EUR 9 million.\nA 25 mm hole and a crack had been detected on the steam circuit 8 months before the accident which could not be repaired without stopping the detarrer. As monitoring of the oxygen level at the detarrer outlet did not show any anomalies, the repair was scheduled for the routine shutdown 3 days after the day of the accident.\nThere are several hypotheses as to the origin of the ignition energy: electrostatic due to friction of the air/gas mixture (also comprising dust) on metal plates, chemical due to the presence of pyrophoric material, or mechanical due to a piece of metal falling inside the detarrer. The external expert assessment concluded that the most likely hypothesis was contact between the coke oven gas and oxygen from the air coming from the leak in the steam network and ignition by electrostatic energy generated by friction between the gases and the metal walls.\nAn electrostatic detarrer had already exploded at this site in July 2005 and at other sites of the group abroad in November 2017 and in 2019. The explosions always occurred when the detarrer was put back into service by supplying the electric fields but never during washing and draining, when the electric fields are not supplied (no ignition source). There were therefore no lessons learned and the risk had not been identified by the operator.\nFollowing this accident, the operator reviewed the risk analyses and undertook additional measures, including revising the procedure for washing the detarrer by carrying out the washing and draining operations under pressure in order to avoid any air entry.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The electric fields of the detarrer were switched off because it was in the washing and draining phase. There was no obvious source of ignition for the gas.\nThere are various hypotheses:\n\nElectrostatic energy was created by friction between the unpurified air/gas mixture that still contained dust and the metal plates, creating a source of ignition.\nPyrophoric materials potentially present could have caused the explosion on contact with oxygen.\nA piece of metal potentially falling inside the detarrer could have created a spark.\n\nThe expert assessments carried out did not reach a clear conclusion as to the source of the ignition.",
        "Consequences": "According to the operator, no hazardous or polluting material was released into the atmosphere apart from the (limited) smoke from the fire. However, crude coke gas from coal distillation was released and burnt for 95 days.\nThe material losses are estimated at EUR 10 million and production losses at EUR&nbsp;9&nbsp;million.",
        "Emergency response": "The operator activated the emergency plan at 16:25. The staff were evacuated. A security perimeter was established. The fuel supply to the installation was shut off. The heating of the batteries was stopped. At 20:00 the fire was extinguished by inerting with nitrogen.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Revision of the procedure for washing the detarrer by carrying out the washing and draining operations under pressure in order to avoid any air entry."

        "Finish Date": "1998-09-16 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Release of phosphorous trichloride from the bottom of an iron tank during decanting in storage tanks linked to the installation. The released liquid, having got in contact with the water in the ground, has caused a primary exothermal reaction forming a hydrochloric acid cloud and secondary reactions forming flammable products and the consequent ignition of such products. The response action for extinguishing the fire with water and foam has caused the formation of hydrochloric acid in significant quantities and the further increase of the hydrochloric acid cloud which moved towards the municipality of Sermoneta, but did not reach it because it dissolved approx. 2 km distance from the installation.The accident occurred at 15:30 of 16 September 1998. The emergency response teams of the establishment extinguished the fires and stopped the leakage of trichloride from the tank in 4 minutes. The HCl cloud which had formed was completely dissolved after an hour. The interruption on the adjacent railway line, which was realised immediately lasted for 40 minutes. The signal for the end of the alarm was given for safety reasons at 20:00 hrs. of the same day.Meteorological conditions:The cloud which was formed, consequent to the above described meteorological conditions, moved before it dissolved for approx. 2 km in direction of the municipality of Sermonetta (257 m above sea level), which is at a higher level than the establishment (20 m above sea level)Temp: 22C, Wind Speed: 3 m/s, Wind Direction: N-NE, precipitation: none",
        "Causes of the accident": "Probable wrong positioning of the tank in respect of the withdrawal point for the transfer of the trichloride to the plant, due to an error of the operator.The rupture (failure) could have been caused by a mechanical failure or by abnormal stress due to the incorrect alignment of the iron tank with the exact discharge position.",
        "Consequences": "Ten persons present in a radius of 500 m of the establishment, went to first care treatment due to burning eyes, vomiting and to disturbances in the respiratory ways and after appropriate medical care were released without being hospitalised. Damage to the vegetation can be assumed due to the release of the cloud: but there is no evidence of significant damages due to the fact that the cloud in his passage towards Sermonetta did not touch particularly sensitive areas before it dissolved.Damages on the connection pipes tank-fixed installation have to be pointed out.People - Remarks: The population has perceive the presence of the cloud and 10 persons went to the local first aid station having symptoms as eye irritation, vomiting and disturbances in the respiratory waysMaterial loss - Remarks: The costs refer to the trichloride and the phosphorous lost in the leakage. The accident did not cause any interruption in the production process. Cost estimated at 6,000 Euros.Disruption of community life: Concerning the press the interest of the public has been limited to the local and regional newspapers for some days; concerning the television, the day of occurrence the accident was reported on the third channel of RAI both at regional level as at national level.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "Although the company knew that by using water in the fire-fighting operation a major amount of hydrochloric acid would have been produced, the company has manged the extinguishing operations of the small&nbsp; fires of the secondary substances formed (small 10 cm high flames) by using water because it was necessary to reduce the temperature of the fix tanks containing flammable substances and of another iron tank containing isobutilene, which were located very closely. The whole operation was performed by the safety team of the installation. Anyhow the external alarm was released (police, carabinieri and fire brigades) according to the offsite emergency plan. Consequent to the accident, always according to the offsite emergency plan, the passage of trains of the line Rome - Napoli&nbsp; which passes some 60 m from the discharge point of the tank was stopped for approx. 40 minutes.Official action taken - legal action: Seizure of the defective valve and of the flexible hose by the Attorney General of Latina. Investigation of the Attorney general under way.Official action taken - other official action: Prescription of modifications of the discharge equipment agreed with the Local Sanitary Services of Latina",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: Modifications have been made in order to improve the discharge system of the iron tanks. The accident demonstrates the need for a better training of the operators responsible for discharging operations."

        "Accident Description": "After loading a batch reactor with all reactants and having it heated up to the initial temperature, the reaction started around 09:55. The continues stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was under reflux cooling. The last visual check of the reflux cooler was at 12:25. At 12:45 an explosion occurred followed by a fire.The fire was extinguished by internal and external fire departments.The explosion and fire heavily damaged the reactor cell and the outside of the building.There were no victims.Neighbouring people had to close doors and windows for 2 hours.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Four hypothetical scenario's were formulated. Intensive lab research was carried out and Cillworth (UK) and other Pharmaceutical Industries were consulted.Definitive conclusion (retained hypothesis): Impurities of an alkali metal in one of the raw materials were much higher then in former batches (250 batches were already performed) and higher then foreseen. The total amount of the impurities was still below the maximum specified. There was no specification for this specific impurity. This impurity had a catalyzing effect on the HN3-producing reaction and not on the HN3-consuming reaction. This led to higher then normal production of HN3 which led to higher concentrations. Most probably the explosion occurred inside glass connections between the reflux cooling and gas purification. There liquid HN3 had accumulated to such a degree that it became highly unstable.",
        "Consequences": "The outside wall was blown away as foreseen as a measure by explosion. The interior of the reactor cell was heavily burned. All glass lining was blown away.Immediately after the explosion a fire occurred which set the thermal oil on fire. This was the largest fire burden and damaged severely the outside of the building.There were no victims due to the low presence of operators (almost all vital parameters have recording instruments outside the reactor cell) and blast resistant wall between the reactor cell and the rest of the building.",
        "Emergency response": "Internal emergency plan was immediately launched.\u200bInternal and external fire brigade came into action.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Lessons learned:Positive:  The damage inside the building was limited to a single reaction cell and the housing of the thermal oil and the outside due to - the arrangement of two reactor in reactor cells isolated by explosion resistant walls- the outside wall was built as an explosion panel so the pressure was released to the outside (high enough above ground level)There were no victims also due to a limited presence possible by bringing all continuous monitoring to the outside of the explosion resistant walls.- Negative: The cause was not detected in the risk analyses. Only the total fraction of all impurities was limitedThe reaction analysis and possible catalysis by impurities was not investigated at the highest concentration as tolerated by the specification."

The date of the 22 October was chosen to do that.  The \"gas stop\" was supposed to go on during 10 hours. So, men in the coking plant decided to do some works on gas pipe network and some other cleaning works during this time. \nThis kind of \"gas stop\" is exceptional because it is very difficult to stop the coke oven. In fact, the oven is made of refractory bricks which can be irreversible destructed if their temperature goes under 600\u00b0C. Lots of works were planned and it explains the big number of persons and particularly subcontractors present during the day of the accident.The gasometer (to store coke oven gas) had been repaired a week before the explosion and some tests had to be done on it. It was decided to do these tests just before the \"gas stop\". It was necessary to see if all the automatic controls were ok.The planned works for this day were: replace some valves on the water and gas piping network, cleaning a transport belt, cleaning of some other equipments and also replace a measuring diaphragm by a blind flange to be able to isolate a piece of the gas pipe. It is at this last work that the coke oven gas escaped.",
        "Causes of the accident": "No safety culture\nNo written procedures to inert the gas line. \nA combination of the impossibility to block in the gas line while supplying the ovens and an unsafe way of trying to inert the line without blocking in the line\nNo coordination between the tests on the gas network and works on the gas pipe and especially on the supplying of the oven during works.\n",

        "Finish Date": "2005-09-30 09:05:00",
        "Accident Description": "After the due consideration of the contradictions, the probable scenario of the accident can be summed up as follows:On the territory of the organic substances establishment of BV Rt in the storage farm for inorganic substances, hydrogen fluoride tank no. 3 (hereinafter HF3) had to be prepared for the inspection by the boiler inspector. The first phase of the preparation is the purging of the empty tank through an adsorption system, while being heated by means of an external pipe bundle. This phase was carried out from 27/09/2005 to 30/09/2005 in the morning. On September 30, 2005 one of the the shifts has started the morning shift. The shift leader assigned his workers to different jobs and establishments at the start of the shift. The plant manager starting to work at 7.30 a.m., after getting preliminary information, instructed shift leader&nbsp; to carry out the mechanical works at storage tank HF3 as a task of priority.Discussing the manpower need for this job, plant manager told to shut down the mono-nitrating plant and after finishing-off the ongoing charge, also the shutdown of fluorination plant no. 2 and he was of opinion that the manpower released in this way would be sufficient for the execution of the task. Shift leader, after the decision made by the plant manager, had the mono-nitrating plant shut down. He first sent the workers from there to the foreman to pick up tools and special protective equipment and then the workers had to contact plant manager for further assignments. Shift leader did not clearly interpret the instructions he received from the plant manager with regard to the operation of fluorination plant no.2, because he has dismissed one of the operators from there and sent him to help with the mechanical works and he did not give clear instructions to the other operator to start a new charge or to stop the operation either. The preparations of the mechanical works related to tank HF3 came to an end at about 8 o'clock. Mechanical works started under the on-site supervision and management of plant manager. Neither the plant manager, nor the workers actually involved in the works deemed it necessary to wear special protective equipment. Simultaneously with the mechanical works the actual process steps of the charge introduced in the night shift at the fluorination plant were going on. Upon the completion of those steps the operator of fluorination plant no. 2 has started to feed a new charge with HF feed, as he interpreted the instructions given by the plant manager that the plant did not need to be shut down, he was only instructed to pay more attention during the handling of the HF-valves.At about 9.00 o'clock a.m 3 works from the team carrying out the mechanical works have started to relocate a pipeline section (about 6 m long) dismantled earlier. The later victim held one end of this pipeline section in his hands. During lifting he was at the free nozzle that was connected to the HF measurement off-gas pipeline of the 2nd fluorination plant. Probably the operator of the fluorination plant no. 2 has finished the feed of HF from the measuring drum and has started the depressurization of the space inside of the drum by that time.Gases saturated with HF released trough the free nozzle have contacted the face and the upper body of the later victim. After recognizing the accident his colleagues have immediately escorted the injured to the emergency shower close to the scene, where they have showered his upper body and then at the first-aid point on the 1st floor they washed off the injured body part with Ca-lactate solution. Then they have transported the worker to the emergency room of the company doctor by forklift truck. The call center operator, on the basis of the information received from the shift leader, informed the paramedics at 9.05 who transported the injured at 9.30 from the territory of BV Rt. into the hospital. The plant manager being close to the scene when recognizing the accident has blocked the open off-gas valve of the HF measuring drum at fluorination plant no. 2. With this movement the release of gases saturated with HF through the free pipe nozzle into the atmosphere was terminated. Note: at a distance of about 0.5 m from the pipe end, in the same off-gas pipeline, there is a shut-off valve that was, on the basis of the information received from the plant manager in the course of the on-site inspection, not blocked in the moment when the accident happened and it was the plant manager who has blocked it after the accident. &nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "Summary of deficiencies:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no individual procedure regulation the preparation of the HF-tank for the authority inspection.Reasons: on the basis of the previous regulations the authority shall inspect the tank every 3 years, according to the new regulations every 5 years in case of this tank. This covers individual mechanical and cleaning works that were executed always under the technical supervision of the plant manager. Though it is specified in the \"Procedure for the production of raw BTF on the fluorination production line no.1 and 2\", art. 3.3.2.2 that for the purposes of maintenance, repair the equipment, pipelines shall be opened only using the relevant protective equipment specified for the individual substances, this protective equipment is listed in detail in art. 3.8.2 for each substance. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workers received training for the individual job concerned in verbal form, the completion of this training is not documented. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requiring the people involved in the mechanical works to use the special protective equipment. The plant manager did not require before the start of the work and even after recognizing smaller abnormalities to use special protective equipment. The plant manager informed the workers on the work and on the related dangers. After being informed they did not think it was necessary to use special protective clothing and in case there was no such protective clothing, they did not refuse to work. Though it is specified in the \"Procedure for the production of raw BTF on the fluorination production line no.1 and 2\", art. 3.3.2.2 that for the purposes of maintenance, repair the equipment, pipelines shall be opened only using the relevant protective equipment specified for the individual substances, this protective equipment is listed in detail in art. 3.8.2 for each material. The collective and individual protective equipment to be made available in case of individual works are listed in the procedure MVSZ-04 as well.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transmission of information for the job was not clearThe shift leader interpreted the instructions of the plant manager improperly, and he was mistaken, as at fluorination plant no. 2 the plant manager instructed to shut down the plant after the charge feed in the night shift would be finished. The mistaken interpretation was due to the fact that the shift leader understood that he would only have to provide manpower for the mechanical works and therefore he sent only one of the operators to the mechanical works. He assigned the other operator to the further operation and he did not describe the assignment in detail. The operator at the fluorination plant no. 2 understood from the instructions of the shift leader that he would not only have to finish the ongoing charge, but he could start feeding a new charge as well. /At that time the operator of fluorination plant no. 2 was only a kind of supervision, therefore, for this activity, even one person would have been sufficient. However, for the feeding of a new charge, in case of the operation of one plant, two persons shall be assigned according to the work instructions./5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At fluorination plant no.2 there was only one person carrying out the feed of the new charge, though the operator should have known on the basis of the work instructions that in case of the operation of a plant 2 people shall be assigned to this activity. 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deficiencies of the risk assessment.Hazards associated to the handling of HF were not covered in detail. &nbsp;",

A second solvent, tetrahydrofurane (THF), was available on site and is more effective in soaking the pan than MEK. The operators knew this and got the THF from the first floor of the coating tower using a bucket (no safety cans were available here since this was not the normal operation).\nIn the accident, the victim also filled a bucket with THF on the first floor, but this time the liquid ignited (most likely from an electrostatic discharge). Knowing that the coating tower was a classified area, the victim has tried to carry the burning bucket outside. For that he had to go down the stairs. In the staircase, he fell and dropped the bucket. This had two effects: burning liquid was splashed onto his clothes and there was a larger burning surface, resulting in a large fire, surrounding the victim.\nHe was able to get out of the staircase and ran (with his clothes burning) towards a colleague in a nearby room.

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nDuring a storm at the end of the working period (most employees had already left the plant), two very powerful, successive explosions occurred in less than 5 seconds in the fusion cavity of the furnace, causing extensive damages to the foundations of the furnace. The first explosion, undoubtedly in the form of a detonation equivalent to 200 kg of TNT, fractured material, destroyed the casting frame and caused the essential part of the damages noted. It also caused the break of a cable in an ingot lowering machine and caused plates and aluminium alloy not dispersed by the electric arc to fall into the casting pit. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two second later. The first explosion could have generated a pressure of 10 to 20 bar on the sides of the pit, and the generated seismic wave was recorded by several seismographs in the region and furnished an energy undoubtedly at least 1,000 times greater than that of the electric arc produced in the building.An inquiry commission was rapidly formed after the accident and worked in close contact with and under the supervision of administrative and judicial authorities. It made use of the services of experts in the following fields: explosions, use of natural gas, prevention, meteorology and storms, metallurgy, civil, mechanical and electrical engineering, combustible dust. The analysis of statements and interviews indicated that a luminous phenomenon in the foundry, followed, almost immediately, by the first explosion and 2 seconds later by a second explosion. The examination of material in the foundry shop near the presumed starting point of the explosion showed that the motor of a mobile hoist located 15 metres from the supposed point of explosion presented indisputable traces of the passage of lightning-related current. In addition, it was possible to determine numerous possibilities for the routing of the current leading to the starting point of the explosion. In particular, the casting pit itself, where the explosion started, was the best grounding point in proximity to the motor. It was supposed that the molten aluminium alloy could have led to: either an explosion of aluminium alloy droplets dispersed in air (which involves a suspension process) or a reaction of molten aluminium with water. The first was opted for. The molten aluminium was suspended in air by the action of the shock wave produced by the electric arc. The shock wave dispersed 150-300 kg (of a total of 1,200 kg) of molten aluminium alloy around the casting frame in the form of a fog of fine droplets. Only a part of the energy of the shock wave was used in this dispersion process. The fog then exploded (as a detonation equivalent to 200 kg of TNT) as a result of the droplets/air reaction. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two seconds later, as a result of the rapid vaporization of cooling water in contact with the molten metal, which fell from the upper part of the casting pit. The first explosion fractured material, destroyed the casting frame and caused the essential part of the damages noted. It also caused the break of a cable in an ingot lowering machine and caused plates and aluminium alloy not dispersed by the electric arc to fall into the casting pit. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two second later. The first could have generated a pressure of 10 to 20 bar on the sides of the pit, and the generated seismic was was recorded by several seismographs in the region and furnished an energy undoubtedly at least 1,000 times greater than that of the electric arc produced in the building. Even if the foundry was equipped with natural gas piping for heating the furnaces, the hypothesis of the formation of a flammable mixture with air was excluded because of: the large volume of the flammable mixture necessary to explain the magnitude of the damages (no major leak was noted), the fact that the mixture would have accumulated in the upper part of the building (whereas damaged were on the ground) and the absence of heat effects resulting from a gas explosion.",

Therefore the accident is notified as a Major Accident considering the amount of released substance.This accident is classified at level 4 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive (110 t of SO2 released in the atmosphere).Should additional information modify the first data submitted in this report (particularly concerning the released amounts of substance) a corrigendum will be issued.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident was caused by an abnormal accumulation of Sulphur in the processing equipment for an unknown reason.\nThe operator had to shut-down the H2S processing unit and the production of phenate in order to enter into the processing equipment and clean them completely. During this shutdown phase the vents of the reactors were directed towards a flare. The cleaning of the processing equipment led to the release of 110 t of SO2 and to the production of 50 t of polluted water to be treated. It was estimated that repair works  would take approximately 20 days.\n",
        "Consequences": "The accident consists in the release of the substances that are part of the process: partial combustion of H2S in SO2 and discharge of this over the equipment used in the process and discharge of fluids consisting in an overcharge of liquid effluents.",
        "Emergency response": "The air pollution event and the overcharge of liquid effluents were caused by the cleaning operations consequent to the clogging of the processing equipment by sulphur. The cleaning was made necessary to restore the operational conditions of the unit and caused the release of SO2 into the atmosphere after combustion of H2S.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The operator, who estimates the operating ratio of the processing unit to be between 90 and 95%, is in permanent contact with the company owning the patent rights of the process in order to improve the unit. Following this accident, the plant was modified: overhaul of the liquid catalyst spray-bars to optimise the H2S absorption of H2S, installation of a stirring device in the area where sulphur deposited in order to avoid any new clogging of the equipment."

        "Accident Description": "ENVIRONMENT AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:\nFine weather with a moderate West-North-Wet wind.\n\nA rapid exothermic reaction of fertilizers occurred within a dryer giving rise to a rapid decomposition of the bulk of the material. The decomposition of the fertilizers resulted in the evolution and dispersion of toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides and, probably, of chlorine.\nThere had been no previous incidents relating to bulk decomposition of fertilizers at this plant although there had been decomposition of small amounts of fertilizers resting on hot surfaces throughout the life of the plant (30 years).",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nThe production of a fertilizer with cigar-burning or self-sustaining decomposition \nproperties, combined with an overheating of the material as it was being re-cycled through the dryer and with the stopping of the dryer for examination, gave rise to a rapid decomposition of the bulk of the material, resulting in the evolution of toxic fumes.\nThe combination of blended fertilizers containing single and triple super-phosphates with a mixture of NPK fertilisers gave rise to a combined fertiliser which had the property of self-sustaining decomposition. This is thought to be due to the unexpected presence of a high contents of insoluble phosphates. Whilst passing through the dryer, the temperature of the product rose to about 130oC causing a rapid exothermic reaction within the dryer with evolution of toxic fumes.The operator intervened by stopping the dryer when the temperature became so high that it created concern. Then a rapid exothermic reaction occurred within the dryer, resulting in the evolution of toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides (and, probably, of chlorine). There had been no previous accidents relating to bulk decomposition of fertilizers at this plant, although there had been decomposition of small amounts of fertilizers resting on hot surfaces throughout the life of the plant (30 years). The plant was in a large multi-floor building (approximately 50m x 50m and 30m high) containing two compound fertilizers production plants. Each plant included conveyor and elevator feed systems with raw material hoppers and weighing systems. These systems were connected to a blunger or mixer and into a 30m x 5m diameter rotary drier, thence by off-take conveyors and elevators to a finishing plant. The production process converted the mixture of fertilizers products from a loose to a granular form.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 1 person was killed and 6 injured by the toxic release inside the establishment. Outside the establishment 12 people were injured by the toxic release.

        "Accident Description": "The fire broke out as a result of build-up of heat following overheating of part of a high-voltage power cable in a poorly ventilated cable duct.There was a series of individual causes the combination of which resulted in the fire breaking out and propagating. The fire was not caused by combustible liquids (lubrication solvents). There was no short-circuit or failure of or defect in any part of the plant, consequently the plant's control system was not activated or able to resolve the problem.The fire was propagated by certain features of the premises itself (type of air inlet, type of cable bushings, unavoidable fire loads in the form of synthetic tanks and piping, cable ducts and glass-fibre reinforced gratings, a bitumen roofing material which melted with the heat of the smoke being emitted and resulted in burning bitumen being spread around).Clear steam was first noticed coming from the zinc bath area, then dark smoke. The fire then spread very quickly. Much more water than expected was needed to tackle the fire and this water could not be completely retained. Some of the water used to extinguish the fire escaped from the inner part of the electroplating plant into an underground gallery and had to be pumped out.",
        "Causes of the accident": "System faults/Design:It is assumed that the sporadic increase of the transition impedances led to the uneven distribution of the electrical current to the existing power cables and to the partial heating of one cable.In addition to the heat that accumulated in the cable tray, more heat was added due to the structural situation (nearby hot water pipes). This process could already have gone on over a longer period without noticeable problems in the production process and without process variables being exceeded. The long-term heating led to the formation of flammable vapours from the present organic materials until the ignition temperature was reached.",
        "Consequences": "Fire resulting in destruction and severe sooting of a large part of the electroplating facility and roof. Some sooting in the ancillary rooms.",
        "Emergency response": "Affected area and adjacent buildings evacuated: the fire was reported to the Berlin fire brigade by the control office. Automatically by the fire alarm at 12.19, by employees at 12.21 (alert button). ",

        "Accident Description": "A scheduled crude oil change led to an increase in pressure and a leak in a bypass. A pipe branch (DN 25) was welded onto the bypass and fitted with a blind flange sluice valve immediately after the connection point.\nA fracture occurred in the area immediately around the weld seam between the bypass and the pipe branch. The pressurised crude oil nebulised and impinged in the form of droplets on an area outside of the production site. The installation was immediately taken out of operation via the isolation and pressure relief system, and flaring was used to relieve the pressure.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "Investigations have shown that the damage relates to a fatigue fracture.\nThe cause of the fatigue was the creation of two-phase mixtures in the exhaust pipe of the safety valve (excess flow valve) in the bypass \u2014 known as \u2018valve chattering\u2019.\n",
        "Consequences": "- Defective pipe end\n- Contamination with crude oil\n",
        "Emergency response": "On-site:\nInstallation taken out of operation and pressure relieved by flaring. Off site: Residents informed, inspection of the affected district, including sampling and analysis. Within the plant:\nAffected area cleaned, pipe end dismantled.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "- Research into similar installations, i.e. ones in which increased water input can lead to corresponding reductions in boiling point, increases in pressure and the development of two-phase mixtures.\n- Regulatory measures.\n- Identify fluid safety valves which discharge into the system and for which fatigue could arise, test at-risk pipe components using non-destructive tests and secure the area through constructive measures.\n- Introduce an early warning system for fatigue of safety valves. Educate staff in the safety valve repair shop.\n"

        "Accident Title": "Explosion and fire of butyl acetate vapours during drum-filling",
        "Start Date": "2015-07-16 11:30:00",
        "Finish Date": "2015-07-16 12:45:00",
        "Accident Description": "At around 11.30 a.m., when a driver employed by an external company (providing transport services to the company on an exclusive basis since 1990) was filling a drum with butyl acetate \u2013 or more probably when the last remaining liquid in the pipeline was being fed in \u2013 vapours inside the drum ignited, causing them to explode. The bottom of the drum was blown off by the pressure that had built up due to deflagration inside, causing the liquid in the drum, which was by now in flames, to spill out violently, partly onto the ground and partly onto the driver, who was taken to hospital with burns on 80% of his body and died 15 days later. The resulting fire spread to only a minor extent because it was fuelled essentially only by the spilled liquid. The quantity of liquid involved is estimated to be essentially the content of the pipeline, from the auxiliary pump situated at pavilion&nbsp;D to the dispenser nozzle, i.e. a quantity corresponding to the final stage of drum-filling (feeding in the last remaining liquid). Given the dimensions of the pipeline (approx. 22 m long and 1 \u00bd\u201d in diameter), this quantity is around of 25 litres max., equal to 22&nbsp;kg. The explosion of the drum can probably be attributed to the flammable atmosphere that had developed inside it igniting; such a flammable atmosphere normally forms above the free surface of a flammable liquid such as normal butyl acetate (flash point +27&nbsp;C\u00b0), which was the product being transferred when the accident occurred. The fire was put out within a few minutes with the fixed extinguishing equipment located in the drum-filling building and through the use of outside hydrants by the internal emergency team. The local fire brigade was called and arrived quickly on the scene when the fire had already been put out. The fire brigade finished the emergency intervention and securing of the site within a few minutes and took instrument readings to check whether flammable substances were present in the atmosphere.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The local public prosecutor\u2019s office initiated judicial proceedings to examine the causes of the event. In this context, an official technical expert was appointed and submitted a report. The expert\u2019s report formulates the hypothesis, which the operator agreed with during the site inspection, that the flammable mixture ignited because of an electrostatic discharge caused by the earth clamp not being properly in contact with the drum. Indeed, as confirmed on site during the inspection, the clamp did not have an interlock system. Such a system allows product to be transferred into a drum only once earthing has been confirmed. In addition, the drum-filling area did not have any system for detecting potentially hazardous atmospheres. These issues were mentioned in the technical report dated 30&nbsp;October 2015, which was drawn up by the working group appointed by the control authority to check on the instructions issued following the examination of the 2011 Safety Report and to analyse the accident. The report indicated, among other things, that the Operating Instruction entitled \u201cCritical area: filling drums with substances and mixtures using the auxiliary pump. Managing drum filling under normal, anomalous and emergency conditions: building A, zone D1, tanks 15 to 21\u201d version 10/2014, drawn up by the company within its safety management system and examined by the working group, does not deal with the transfer of butyl acetate. The Operating Instruction also requires the use of an earth clamp but does not envisage a check that equipotential bonding has actually taken place. It also provides that drum-filling be halted in the event of an anomaly, with the definition of anomaly being given in general terms in a separate procedure. The accident probably happened when the last remaining liquid in the pipeline was being fed in, with vapours inside the drum igniting, causing the explosion. It is interesting to note that it is when the last acetate residues are being fed in that the risk is highest of an explosive atmosphere forming inside the drum above the free surface of the liquid phase, since the quantity of liquid being added is low. Under such conditions it is more likely that the flammable mixture will be within the flammable range. The details outlined above are confirmed in the official technical expert\u2019s report.\nAnother matter to consider concerns the training of the victim: as stated by the operator and in the report, his job description as a driver did not include transferring products into drums (even though the worker was probably aware of the procedures for carrying out this operation, at least from having watched other staff do it). In addition, a further \u2018aggravating\u2019 factor in the accident that caused the death of the worker caught up in the explosion is that this death could probably have been avoided if the worker had been wearing all the personal protective equipment (overalls, helmet, etc.) required when filling drums, in particular fireproof antistatic overalls, which would have protected the area of his body that was most seriously burned by the flames. Indeed, the operator has stated that, when the explosion occurred, the deceased worker was wearing antistatic shoes and gloves but no overalls, helmet or goggles. Lastly, on the day of the accident, the fact that the worker was not using personal protective equipment was not noted/remarked upon either by colleagues who were involved in other transfer operations but did come into contact with him, or by management staff supervising operations and present that day in the offices.",
        "Consequences": "Personal injury/death.\nThe event caused the death of the worker filling the drum. The fact that the vapours inside the drum ignited caused them to explode. The bottom of the drum was blown off by the pressure that had built up due to the deflagration inside, and the liquid in the drum, which was by now in flames, spilled out violently, partly onto the ground and partly onto the worker, who was burned on his face, torso, upper and lower limbs &ndash; a total of 80% of his body &ndash; sparing only his upper thorax, inner abdomen, hands and the soles of his feet (because of the protective gloves and shoes). The worker was immediately given first aid and taken to hospital, where he died of complications 15 days later (on 31 July 2015).Material damage.The fire spread to only a minor extent because it was fuelled essentially only by the spilled liquid. It caused limited damage to drum-filling station D1 inside building A. During the inspection committee&rsquo;s site inspection, station D1 still showed evident damage caused by direct flame exposure, both at ground level and on devices and equipment up to a height of around 6&nbsp;m above ground. As indicated in the official technical expert&rsquo;s document and declared by the operator:&nbsp;\nall the components present were damaged: the roller conveyor delivering drums, the roller conveyor bringing drums to the scales, the button console, the scales, the local extractor fan and the dispenser nozzle. After the event, the dispenser nozzle used to fill the drum displayed signs of a blast;\nthe drum-filling pipeline near D1 and the roller conveyor delivering drums were also damaged to a lesser but still significant extent. In the surrounding area, five drums exploded and their bottoms and lids can be seen in the photos taken by the official technical expert. One of the exploded drums lost its bottom, whilst the lid, without the cap, remained attached. There were caps on the lids of all the other exploded drums. The vapour extractor was found burned and positioned above the drum. There was no evidence to state whether it had been turned on. The auxiliary pump was found switched on.&nbsp;\nOverall, the damage observed can be attributed to the results of a pool fire resulting from the spillage onto the ground of a relatively minor quantity of flammable liquid and a number of deflagrations within some drums.",
        "Emergency response": "The extent of the fire was limited to the drum-filling area. It was thus put out within 15/20 minutes, with the internal emergency team working for 10 minutes and the fire brigade, which had been called out, working for another 5 minutes. The company deployed the manually operated fixed extinguishing system and used two hydrant-connected UNI45 hoses to put out the flames in station D1, one dry powder extinguisher for the flames engulfing the victim\u2019s legs and a fire blanket on the victim. The emergency was managed by three members of the internal emergency team to put out the fire, two people to give the victim first aid and one person to communicate with outside bodies, the medical emergency services and fire brigade. No alarm was sounded to evacuate staff from the plant, because the evacuation alarm system was undergoing maintenance when the accident occurred. The outside bodies that intervened were: fire brigade teams from the local fire department with specialised NCBR (nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological) support, helicopter ambulance, police forces, local police, health and safety at work service and regional environmental protection agency.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The information gathered and the reconstruction and analysis of the event in question make it possible to identify certain critical points for improvement. These are directly linked to the causes and were also included amongst the instructions issued by the \u2018Seveso\u2019 control authorities and health authorities in relation to the accident:&nbsp;\nthe need for the operations prior to filling drums to include a check that the mobile container to be filled has been equipotentially bonded. When the result of this check is negative, it must not be possible for the filling pumps to be started up;there must be a ban on filling drums when the following conditions arise:\n\nmalfunctioning of the extractor fan serving the drum-filling area or failure to turn it on;\ndetection of flammable atmospheres in the drum-filling area, through installation of a system for detecting flammable vapours;\nthe mobile container has been filled to its maximum capacity for the substance in question;\n\nthe risk analysis must cover all possible accident types linked to drum-filling;the risk assessment document for explosions must be updated, ensuring that all items of equipment installed in explosion hazard areas are suitable for those areas based on the area classifications;the safety management system must be re-examined in terms of risk analysis, training of in\u2011house and outside personnel and operational supervision, particularly for the transfer of flammable liquids into mobile containers. In particular, the training of in-house personnel must be improved as regards the systematic use of the personal protective equipment for product transfer operations."

        "Causes of the accident": "According to expert opinion, the most probable cause was the accidental triggering of fire cracker igniters and other fireworks after falling. Rodents, which had already been noticed in the storage, may have been the cause of the fall.",
        "Consequences": "The explosion, perceived at 30 km distance, damaged also workshops, storage facilities and offices. It did not cause any casualties or on-site environmental damage. Following the initial ignition mentioned above (fall of pyrotechnic materials, probably due to rodents, which triggered the explosion), the fire may have spread to other ignitors or cardboard packings. After a certain time, the fire reached the detonation cords which exploded forming a small crater.The products dispersed by this first, relatively, limited explosion caught fire, affecting the anti-hail rocket-engines(containing ammonium nitrate explosive), which detonated partially, forming a 1.6 m wide and 0.25 m deep crater.Approximatively 20 seconds later, ammonium nitrate, tolite (TNT) and pentolite type explosives detonated, forming two large craters. The largest one had a diameter of 5.4 m and was 1.5 m deep. The power of the explosion, according to calculations, corresponds to 1770 kg TNT (tolite). The explosion blasted the metallic structure of the building and the blasting effect severely damaged two other storage buildings deforming the structure of one. These storage buildings were hit by incandescent metallic projectiles. Due to the damaging of the external panelling, fires ignited. Cases containing gunpowder exploded in one of the storage buildings. The second one burned with sporadic explosions flares. The combustion of smoke candles and similar products created a dense black smoke.The 142 employees of the plant were put in technological unemployment. ",
        "Emergency response": "Alarm was raised immediately by the two watchmen.The fire brigade, to protect the rest of the installation, first extinguished secondary dry grass fires and then brought the principal fires under control at 21:30 h.The following day the burnt storage buildings were flooded in order to avoid the risk of new explosions. The damaged storage buildings were covered with tarpaulin.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The reconstruction of the destroyed facilities was subjected to a new authorisation procedure.

        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENTS AND CONSEQUENCES:\nDuring the polymerization on the ethylene in a 750 litres reactor, an exothermic runaway decomposition occurred. The pressure increase resulted in the release of the ethylene and its decomposition products via the two reactor vent stacks and via the dump valves on the supply lines. The released gas was ignited apparently by the hot carbon particles obtained by the decomposition of the ethylene. The ignition of the gas cloud resulted in an aerial explosion.\n\nCAUSES:\nThe ethylene was released from the reactor and the supply lines as a result of an exothermic runaway decomposition. The released gas was ignited (apparently by the hot carbon particles obtained by the decomposition of the ethylene) because the automatic water quenching system operated but failed to prevent the aerial ignition. This was due to a quenching system design not appropriate.  The intervention of automatic isolation valves on the reactor were not fast enough to prevent more unused ethylene entering the reactor and therefore to feed the aerial explosion. Automatic dump valves on the feeding line operated 2 seconds to dump residual ethylene to atmosphere resulting also in feeding the aerial explosion.",

The member of staff carrying out the unloading was not aware that the unloading process did not lead directly into the storage tank, but via an intermediate tank.At a low ambient temperature, carbon disulphide becomes viscous, which results in the flow becoming blocked, the intermediate tank reaching its maximum filling level and the flow pump stopping.Only when the contents of the intermediate tank have flowed out can the pump be restarted.\nDue to poor communication between the firm and those responsible for unloading, and to the lack of knowledge of the staff member during the unloading, it was erroneously assumed that the transhipment operation was finished.\nThe release of the carbon disulphide occurred at a point where the metal fabric hose was damaged, directly adjacent to the unloading gantry.There was a sharp kink in the hose immediately after the flange connection. This is where the leak occurred.Sharply bending, compressing, twisting or kinking a metal fabric hose is to be avoided.\nOn the basis of the operator\u2019s documentation, it was not possible to determine whether the setup at the time of the accident corresponded to the original design or whether a different metal fibre hose had been installed in the meantime.Although all participants in an on-site meeting were of the opinion that the damaged installation did not meet the standards, nobody in the company (over a long period of time) had questioned the situation.",

        "Accident Description": "ENVIRONMENT AND ATMOSPHERICAL CONDITIONS:Ambient temperature = 7\u00b0C. Atmospheric Stability Class = C. Wind direction = 340\u00b0 with a speed of ?? m/s.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The accident occurred in a peak saving station used to store liquefied natural-gas (LNG). The station included a natural gas liquefaction unit, a LNG storage and a LNG compression/vaporization/water bath Thurley vaporizer-facilities. During peak demands, LNG was pumped up to 82 barg to 8 vaporisers from which the gas was injected into the transmission line to 72 barg. As a routine exercise to verify the availability of the site to export gas, the equipment had to be brought to a \"1- hour\" stand-by condition and LNG used to cool down pipes and pumps between the storage tanks and vaporisers. The Thurley vaporiser consisted of a large steel water tank, the water being heated by 6 gas burners. The air supply for the burners was coming from a single local fan via ductwork (up to 24\" diameter). The LNG passed through tubes inside the water bath, evaporating and warming up to 20\u00b0C. The LNG inlet to the vaporiser was controlled by a motorised hand indicated control (HIC) valve from the control room. An additional emergency shut-down (ESD) valve could be operated locally or remotely. Between these valves there were four drain valves and a relief valve. The drain valves were 0.5 m and 1.5 m above the ground level. The lower level drain valves were the ones normally used.On December 5, an availability exercise was carried out and five of the 8 vaporisers had to be brought to a \"1- hour\" stand-by condition. Two operators were working on A, B and C vaporisers and other two on E and F vaporisers. The shift engineer was present to start-up the LNG pumps and open the main valve. Vaporisers A, B and C were cooled down according to the normal procedure (admission of small amounts of LNG and low level drain valves opened to accelerate the cooling) and vaporisers E and F were being closed when the pumps were started resulting in a jet of LNG from one of the open drain valves. 30 seconds later there was an explosion and fire-ball. Two operators received burns to their hands and face. The fire-ball was approximately 40m x 25 m.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:The LNG jet occurred because the drain lines were opened and venting when the pump was started. The operators did not make sure that the valves were closed. The released natural gas was drawn into one of the air intake to a vaporiser burner and was ignited by a pilot flame, flashing back and igniting the gas that was present in the area following the cooling down exercise. Even if it was not known, due to an inadequate process analysis, the cooling down exercise involving the release of LNG from 5 vaporisers resulted in the presence of sufficient gas in the area to cause an explosion when ignited.The process was not adequately analyzed because it was not known that, following the cooling down procedure, in the area there was the presence of sufficient gas to cause an explosion if ignited. Also, the location of the air intake to the vaporizer burners was not adequate &nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Two operators received burns to their hands and face because of the fire-ball. Approximately, 40 rescue personnel were involved in the accident (7 fire tenders, 2 fire chiefs, 3 ambulances and 4 police cars attended) but nobody was injured.MATERIAL LOSS:The accident caused minor structural damage to the plant (paint damages,cracked gauge glass).Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The internal emergency teams were called and the operators closed the liquefied natural gas outlet valves\n(code 7999) and put out small residual fires (code 7102).EXTERNAL SERVICES:External fire-fighting services (7 fire tenders, 2 fire chiefs) were called. Also external ambulance services (3 cars) and police intervention (4 cars) were requested.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- the system of work adopted for cooling down the pipework, valves and pumps to be modified and the drain valves not to be opened to accelerate cooling so that no gas is released to the atmosphere during this operation;\n2- the air intake to the vaporiser burners was relocated out of the classified Zone 1. Another site in the country that was using a similar system had also been modified."

        "Accident Description": "On 06.11.2008 a fire, caused by a technical failure of a low voltage switch cabinet, occurred in the operative area of a electro-plating plant. The electro-plating plant is located on the ground-floor of the hangar whereas a transformer-room (switch cabinet room) fed by a 20 kV line is located on the second floor. A fire spread from the low voltage switch cabinet over to 9 other low voltage switch cabinets. A series of high voltage cabinets located in the same room were partially damaged. Alarm was triggered by the fire alarm system. Fire extinguishing operations could be performed only after shutting down the high voltage feed.\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Initially fire fighting operations started from outside of the room. Penetrating the room at that time was not possible due to the fact that the high voltage power supply to the room still had not been shut down.\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rescue service with two emergency doctors, 2 ambulances, 1 head of rescue operations-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;by 22:51 hrs the competent authorities were informed by telephone\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An emergency response command office was set up with the participation of the fire brigade, representatives of the company, the office of the district president and the electric power provider\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fire could be extinguished in a relatively short time once the representative of the electric power supplier and the technical personnel of the company could establish that the electric power supply to the room had been shut off and that the room was grounded.\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Apart from the damage directly caused in the room by the fire, approx. 50% of the company remained without electric power supply. The metal plating plant in the accident area was only affected by spreading combustion smoke.\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By 23:14 hrs Secondary alarm of the voluntary fire brigade requesting a high-performance ventilator in order to free the hangar from the smoke. \n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By 23:30 hrs the onsite fire-brigade reported that the fire was extinguished. Following to that the decision was taken to activate the ventilator in order to free the hangar from the smoke.\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By 00:15 hrs final meeting of the emergency response command deciding to continue forced ventilation for another 30 min. and then to switch over to natural ventilation. The firewatch was taken over by the onsite fire-brigade. A task force of 130 members participated at the emergency response operations onsite. Approx. 50% of the company\u2019s premises remained without electric power. Meanwhile also the criminal police reached the accident site.\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The emergency response command was called-off officially by 00:25 hrs. \n",
        "Causes of the accident": "Technical failure of low-voltage switch-cabinet.The switch cabinets had been controlled 2 month before the event with a thermal imaging camera. Connecting power lines were coated with a fire protecting paint. 14 days before the event a control was performed by external experts.",
        "Consequences": "-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Burnt out switch cabinets-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Strong sooting in the room affected by the fire-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sooting of neighbouring rooms-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Consequential losses caused by power failure -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.000.000 EUR material damage",
        "Emergency response": "Alarm triggered by the fire alarm system, the extinguishing operations could be performed after shutting down the (high voltage) electric supply.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Complete refurbishment of the low voltage distribution system according to the state of the art, improvement of the preventive fire protection system.Further a better organizational regulation is needed, allowing a faster shut down of the high voltage supply, in order to be able to start extinguishing operations earlier.

        "Emergency response": "The immediate evacuation of the installation was organised as well as the activation of an \"evacuation-push-button\" and the alerting of the on-site fire-brigade and the management was put into place. With the activation of the \"evacuation-push-button\" all material transport operations and therefore also the pump which transfers the raw aldehyde (unrefined - not distilled acetaldehyde) in the distillation unit were shut down (closed). Due to the fact that the pipe rupture occurred in flow direction the distillation column was isolated. The significant release of product (acetaldehyde) was caused by the fact that the degassing column including the connection pipe could empty itself through the leak point (rupture point), which had a diameter of 100 cm ",

The alert was sounded by staff in the boiler house, at the same time as the almost simultaneous triggering of the alarm by the fire detectors. Unit 1 was manually shut down immediately after the alarm, via the emergency stop, before other signals would have led to an emergency shutdown.The fire was extinguished by the regular fire service.\nThe thermal current and chimney effect in the boiler house proved to be highly effective in ventilating the smoke and heat. The high temperature and heat produced during the fire were rapidly discharged up towards the roof and out via the existing openings in the roof structure. The supply of fresh air at a very low outside temperature and the fact that the boiler house\u2019s doors were partially open had a positive impact in this respect.\nSafety measures:The alarm was raised by telephone call to the regular fire service, which arrived quickly on the scene (alarm raised at 17.15&nbsp;hrs, regular fire service on the scene by 17.27&nbsp;hrs).The fire was fully extinguished by around 20&nbsp;hrs.(No automatic sprinkler systems in the boiler area.)",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause of the fire was identified as a leak from a defective pipe joint (\u2018cutting ring screw connection\u2019) on a line conveying oil to a burner at a non-visible location.\nWhen the cutting ring screw connection was assembled in 1988, the inserted pipe end on one side did not have its rough edges smoothed and it was not severed cleanly. As a result, the assembly was at an angle. Already at the time of assembly, the screwed coupling nut resulted in a non-uniform setting of the cutting ring, with discernible indents, which meant that it fell short of the intended fitting depth. The poorly fitted pipe was clearly exposed to higher pressures, causing the nuts to loosen over time and allowing the cutting ring to slip out of the conical seat of the housing; eventually the pipe slipped out of the joint, without significant external damage.\nAll the required components were present. There were no indications of material or manufacturing defects, fatigue or corrosion. In addition, all the other system joints are welded.According to the TRwS technical regulations for products hazardous to water, these types of line joint should be regarded as technically sealed and not subject to any specific inspection obligation.",

The accident is reported due to the technical relevance of the same.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The exact&nbsp; cause of the accident has not been formally established neither by the appointed experts nor by the operator himself; both parties consider as most likely that the cause is directly linked to the electric system without defining exactly, if the fire started due to a short-circuit or the bad conditions of some electrical component.The fire was detected at 2:50 h.At 2:58 h the fire brigade of Soissons was alerted from the control room of the establishment on request of the foreman. The foreman notified the accident and released the emergency response procedures consisting in shutting down and evacuating the plant sections affected (evacuating the Cellulose work-shop, shutting-down gas fed boilers ...)At 3:10 h arrival of the shift managers, the safety mangers , the safety assistants and the on-site fire brigade manager .At 3:17 arrival the fire brigade of Soissons who stopped at approximately 50 metres from the electric room and observed an abundant dense smoke&nbsp; cloud near the ground. At this time no flames could be detected and searching for the fire source generating the smoke was a priority.At 3:34 the fire fighters declare to be still searching for the flame sourceBetween 3:34 h and 3:53 a full fire developed in the room affected by the accident. Flames appeared suddenly over the walls reaching 5 to 10 m height. The heat emission of the fire has to be considered as high.&nbsp;At 4:47 h the fire fighters requested the assistance of the Chemical Emergency Response Unit after discovering the presence of transformers containing pyralenes fact that had been ignored until then.The fire fighters fought against the fire until 5:30 by means of sprinkling; the water flow employed is estimated in 100m3/h. The fire fighters declared the fire being under control at 5:30. It is estimated that the blazing combustion lasted between 1 and 2 hours.At 6:20 h the fire was declared as extinguished.",
        "Consequences": "The amount of PCB which has been lost is of approximately 500 to 660 kg of a total of 2800 kg.The amount of dioxins released is estimated in approximately 13 kg; the results of the analyses which were performed have shown that a significant part of the dioxins and furanes produced during the fire remained concentrated near the source of the fire.The results of the analyses performed in the control area (2,5 km downwind) are near the lower reference thresholds for French agricultural areas (between&nbsp; 0.002 and 1 ng TEQ/kg of soil) or urban areas (between 0,2 and 176 ng TEQ/kg of soil) and are much lower than the reference thresholds for French industrial areas ( between 20 and 60 ng TEQ/kg of soil).",
        "Emergency response": "A prefectoral order was issued on request of the inspectorate for classified Installations (DRIRE) which:&nbsp;limited the access to the site; imposed decontamination measures; the performance of analyses and of a detailed risk analysis.96 persons which were present during the accident (fire fighters, employees, 2 journalists and 7 people living in the vicinity) underwent medical check-up.Basing on the trajectory of the smoke cloud a conical area of 2,5 km was submitted to monitoring and the consumption of vegetables was forbidden. A hundred samples&nbsp; taken from soot, building elements, soil, water and vegetables proved the presence of dioxins and furanes. Decontamination was performed on the buildings and grounds of the plant and on 2 buildings located 250 m from the plant. A plan for eliminating PCB containing material is set up. The authorisation for the progressive start-up of the plant, 15 days after the accident, was issued by prefect basing on the documentation on the works performed and relating expert advice presented by the operator. Limitations concerning the off-site area were lifted after 25 days.Epidemiological monitoring during a year of the affected persons is foreseen.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The accident scenario \"fire of a transformer\" had not been considered in the safety report made in 1992, probably because this kind of material is present in many sites and thus it is someway a bit trivialised. Nevertheless these transformers are subject to risk prevention regulations concerning PCB.The lack of knowledge by the personnel concerning the precise characteristics of the transformers has delayed the assessment of the chemical risk by the emergency response service.Protection measures have been set up only belatedly. These measures have been taken only after the fire had been extinguished, in reason of the fact that the event was notified to the competent authorities only two hours after the fire had been put under control.In this kind of event, where the entire public service system is concerned by the response measures, it is essential to work in synergy. This allows to gain time and avoids to double efforts in the same research area."

        "Accident Description": "\u200bA major explosion and fire occurred at Esso\u2019s Longford gas processing site in Victoria, Australia. Two employees were killed and eight others injured. During the morning of Friday 25 September 1998, a pump supplying heated lean oil to heat exchanger GP905 in Gas Plant No. 1 went offline for four hours, due to an increase in flow from the Marlin Gas Field which caused an overflow of condensate in the absorber. (The plant was complex and the hot oil pump was only one component involved in the accident process; why the pump shutdown is complicated and important.) A heat exchanger is a vessel that allows the transfer of heat from a hot stream to a cold stream, and so does not operate at a single temperature, but experiences a range of temperatures throughout the vessel. Temperatures throughout GP905 normally ranged from 60 \u00b0C to 230 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F to 446 \u00b0F). Investigators estimated that, due to the failure of the lean oil pump, parts of GP905 experienced temperatures as low as \u221248 \u00b0C (\u221254 \u00b0F). Ice had formed on the unit, and it was decided to resume pumping heated lean oil in to thaw it. When the lean oil pump resumed operation, it pumped oil into the heat exchanger at 230 \u00b0C (446 \u00b0F)\u2014the temperature differential caused a brittle fracture in the exchanger (GP905) at 12.26pm.\nAbout 10 metric tonnes of hydrocarbon vapour were immediately vented from the rupture. A vapour cloud formed and drifted downwind. When it reached a set of heaters 170 metres away, it ignited. This caused a deflagration (a burning vapour cloud). The flame front burnt its way through the vapour cloud, without causing an explosion. When the flamefront reached the rupture in the heat exchanger, a fierce jet fire developed that lasted for two days.\nThe rupture of GP905 led to other releases and minor fires. The main fire was an intense jet fire emanating from GP905. There was no blast wave\u2014the nearby control room was undamaged. Damage was localised to the immediate area around and above the GP905 exchanger.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The fire and explosion was caused by a cold brittle fracture of a heat exchanger. The immediate cause was a process upset in which the temperature of the heat exchanger dropped much below normal levels. Operators had no idea of any potential dangers associated with such low temperatures and their actions led to thermal shock and catastrophic failure.This failure mechanism came completely unexpected.The official commission of inquiry criticised Esso, in one of its key findings, for not having carried out a systematic hazard identification of the plant.",
        "Consequences": "The incident caused the destruction of Plant 1 and shutdown of Plants 2 and 3 at the site. Gas supplies were reduced to 5% of normal, resulting in 250,000 workers being sent home across the State as factories and businesses were forced to shutdown. This left the State of Victoria without natural gas supply for 9-19 days affecting millions of people, closing businesses and causing serious economic disruption.",
        "Emergency response": "The fire, which broke out following an explosion at 12:30 p.m. on September 25, burned for over two days before being declared extinguished on September 27.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Develop procedures for forseeable failures with significant consequences and train operators in these procedures Hazard identification and detailed study of failure types essential Safety Management Systems must be implemented and audited effectively Design alarm systems so that the number of alarms is appropriate (stop crying wolf) Control of escalation "

This resulted in a recrystallisation of copper cables between the contact rails and the brushes causing individual strands and entire cables to separate.It is possible that an arc caused the fire to ignite; on the other hand, it is also possible that the heat released was enough to ignite the conductor roll with the deposit build-up itself, or ignite the plastic extraction system which was in the immediate vicinity.The extraction system caused the fire to spread quickly and explosively. This is due to hydrogen which was still in the extraction ducts after the plant had been shut down.",

        "Accident Description": "The company manufactured a variety of powder coating and paint additives by polymerizing acrylic monomers in a 1500 gallon reactor.The company had received an order for slightly more of an additive than the normal-sized recipe would produce. Plant managers scaled up the recipe to produce the required larger amount of polymer, and added all of the additional monomer needed into the initial charge to the reactor. This more than doubled the rate of energy release in the reactor, exceeding the cooling capacity of the reactor condenser and causing a runaway reaction. The reactor pressure increased rapidly. Solvent vapors vented from the reactor's manway, forming a flammable cloud inside the building. The vapors found an ignition source, and the resulting explosion killed 1 worker and injured 14. The blast destroyed the facility and damaged off-site structures.The accident has been investigated by the US Chemical Safety Board.",
        "Causes of the accident": "On the day of the accident, a modification in the production recipe was introduced in order to produce approximately 12% more of the final product obtained from a normal batch. The plant superintendent determined the quantities of solvent, monomer and initiator needed for the reaction, which initially was not particularly vigorous. Several minutes later, the senior operator heard a loud hissing and saw vapor venting from the reactor manway, which forced him out of the building. He returned with a respirator and was able to start emergency cooling water flow to the jacket. However, the building exploded 30 seconds after he left.Investigations after the accident revealed that there were several causes that led to the runaway reaction.- The company did not perform hazard identification of their processes. No formal hazard review had been conducted to address what could go wrong during reactor operations. The company had minimal safety information on its polymerization processes, even though this was the core of its manufacturing business. Product formulations were optimized to meet customer specifications. However, reaction characterization and calorimetry were not performed to establish process equipment performance requirements. Indeed, calorimetry experiments performed after the accident proved that the modifications on the recipe generated a heat output that was 2.3 times that of the original recipe, clearly exceeding the heat removal capacity of the condenser and the emergency jacket cooling of the reactor.- When scaling-up new products from the laboratory, previous plant managers had typically estimated initial production batch sizes based on past experience, or with simple trial-and-error systems. Batch quantities were gradually increased until the sight glass in the condensate return line showed that the condenser was too close to flooding, or that another performance limit, like the reactor pressure increase, was being approached. The condenser's cooling capacity was not documented, nor could the cooling load be determined with the available instrumentation. As a result, information essential to the safe operation of the reactor was not available.- Most of the management and operations personnel had been on the job less than one year (in some cases much less) and lacked previous polymer manufacturing experience. Personnel, including site managers, were thus poorly prepared to recognize potentially hazardous changes to product recipes, or to respond to an incipient runaway reaction. Additionally, the company had no chemical or other engineer on staff, and none had been contracted to evaluate the hazards associated with reactive operations at the site.- Based on the accident investigation, it turned out that the employees and managers had little or no understanding of reactive hazards. They had not been trained on, and did not understand, the safety margin of safety needed or available in their polymerization operations. Furthermore, they had little knowledge of the sensitivity of the reactor to changes in product recipes, batch sizes or reaction conditions.- The company relied primarily on a procedural safeguard to prevent loss of reactor control: the batch sheet, which was used as an operating procedure at the site. But additional process safeguards, necessary when coping with the effects of runaway reactions, where totally missing in the reactor set-up. Examples of systems that could have helped to prevent or mitigate the accident are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - high pressure alarm systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - automatic emergency cooling water to the reactor jacket.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - automatic shut-off of initiator feed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - automatic injection of \"short stop\" solution to stop the polymerization reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - automatic venting or dumping of the reactor to a safe location.- After the investigation of the accident, it was found that operators used to open the reactor manway after every batch cycle to clean the reactor. Long standing practice at the facility was to then close the manway and secure it using only 4 of the 18 clamps specified by the manufacturer. The risk posed by this practice had not been recognized because the reactor normally ran at near-atmospheric pressure, for which four clamps were thought to be adequate. Under this situation, it was estimated that the manway began to leak flammable solvent vapors when the reactor pressure reached approximately 23 psig, well below the reactor's maximum allowable working pressure of 75 psig.- The design of the tubular heat exchanger used as a condenser made it difficult to remove for inspection or cleaning. Inspection of this equipment after the accident showed that it was badly fouled, likely reducing the condenser capacity at least 25 per cent. The company had no program to systematically monitor and control water side fouling, and it was found that there was not any inspection&nbsp; or cleaning process to remove the scale, rust and sediment accumulated on the tube during 30 years of service.",
        "Consequences": "1 opeartor was killed and 14 were injuredThe blast destroyed the facility and damaged off-site structures.The fires following the explosion generated thick smoke, and local residents were asked to shelter in-place for several hours. The fires were extinguished the next day.",
        "Emergency response": "During this incident, none of the production employees evacuated to a safe location. At the time of the explosion, 6 employees, including the manager and superintendent, gathered outside a doorway on the upper level while a seventh was on the lower level by the lab. The employee on the lower level was killed, while those outside the doorway were injured, two of them seriously.The company was unprepared for an emergency. Specifically:- The Emergency Action Plan did not list events or describe situations that might necessitate a plant evacuation.- Operating procedure did not specify employees' actions in the event of a chemical release or loss of reactor control.- Employees were not trained on the Emergency Action Plan and evacuation drills were not conducted.- The facility was not equipped with an emergency alarm system.The Department of Public Safety responded rapidly and called in mutual aid support from County and nearby municipalities. Employees and Public Safety officers assisted injured employees.The fires following the explosion generated thick smoke, and local residents were asked to shelter in-place for several hours. The fires were extinguished the next day.",
        "Lesson Learned": "This incident provides important lessons for manufacturers with operations involving reactive chemistryIDENTIFY AND CONTROL REACTIVE HAZARDSManufacturers should take a comprehensive approach, and:- Identify and characterize reactive hazards.- Systematically evaluate what can go wrong, including mis-charging of reagents, loss of cooling, instrument malfunction, and other credible failure scenarios.- Implement, document, and maintain adequate safeguards against identified failure scenarios. Multiple, independent safeguards may be needed to reliably ensure the safety of the reactive process.CONTROL CHANGEChemical manufacturers and others with reactive chemistry operations should control changes to batch recipes, including key operating conditions, such as:- The quantities, proportions and sequencing of reactor feeds.- Reaction temperature.- Conditions that could cause initiator or monomer accumulation.- Conditions that could affect the deactivation of monomer inhibitors or stabilizers.MAINTAIN PROCESS EQUIPMENT CAPABILITYManufacturers with reactive chemistry operations should:- Document the perfromance requirements and capabilities of process equipment, such as the reactor condenser at the installation where the accident took place.- Periodically inspect and service process equipment, including the water side of the heat exchangers, to maintain appropriate safety margins.TRAIN PERSONNEL ON HAZARDS PROCEDURESManufacturers should ensure that worker training includes:- The nature of the reactive hazards, including process safety margins.- Operating procedures, including appropriate cautions and warnings, the consequences of deviations, recognition of deviations and abnormal operations, and the appropriate responses to control or mitigate the effects.PREPARE FOR EMERGENCIESManufacturers should:- Implement an effective emergency plan.- Train employees on the plan.- Install an evacuation alarm system that is audible and/or visible throughout the facility.- Conduct regular exercises to help ensure rapid evacuation to a safe location in an emergency.- Coordinate their emergency planning with offsite response organizations and the Local Emergency Planning Committee."

        "Accident Description": "In the morning of januari 7th 2010, the mixing of several products was started in order to produce a detergent. The mixing was done in a 9000 litre tank in which a total amount of 8000 litres of detergent is produced. At the point where the tank contained 6000 litres of mixed products, 2 tons of a 40 percent HF-solution needed to be added. This is done by successively adding the content of 2 plastic IBC's containing each 1 ton of the 40 percent HF-solution. An IBC is transported with a small stacker to the vicinity of the tank, prepared for emptying (remove the safety button of the tap at the bottom and screw open -but not remove- the cap of the filling hole at the top), then lifted and emptied.After the lifting of the first IBC, the stacker was driven forward only about half a meter in order to put the tap of the IBC above the opening on top of the mixing-tank. After this movement, the stacker and the IBC leaned over and fell. The IBC fell off the stacker, hit a contractor employee, and landed on the ground where it's contend completely drained on the floor via the open filling hole.",
        "Causes of the accident": "By driving forward the stacker with the IBC in a high position, the stacker became unbalanced. There were different main causes for this unbalance, which led together to the tipping over: - The IBC was lifted too high related to its weight, outside the specified working range of the stacker (this risk wasn't known to the operators). So the stacker was not adequate for this job.- The floor wasn't completely flat and horizontal : there was a small slope to a drain. The maximum height difference between the front wheels of the stacker caused by this slope was about 1 cm.- The operator just stepped off the platform of the stacker. By this action, the centre of gravity of the loaded stacker moved slightly forward.- The IBC wasn't filled to the top. 1 ton of HF-solution is less than 1000 litres. So the liquid was able to move inside the IBC, which effects the position of the centre of gravity of the IBC.At the moment of the accident, there was no risk assessment made by the company regarding to the procedure of filling the tank. Regarding to the handling of HF, there was a written instruction with some points of attention, but it didn't describe the filling activities.There is a training program for stacker operators in the company, which includes a specialised and certified training for fork-lift drivers. The operator involved in the accident only worked at the company for 10 months. At the time of the accident, he didn't pass through the whole training program, and he wasn't a certified fork-lift driver yet. Although, he was allowed to work with the stacker, because in the past he had a similar job.",
        "Consequences": "A contractor employee, installing a new apparatus in the vicinity of the mixing tank, was hit at the head by an edge of the falling IBC. By this impact he was thrown to the floor, where the fallen IBC was draining.&nbsp; The operator responded promptly by moving the victim away from the leaking liquid pool. During this intervention, the victim made a little contact at his legs with the HF-solution. He was treated immediatly with calcium gluconate gel.Another operator wanted to inform the people in the office about the accident. Without reflecting about the best way to do this, he took the shortest way and ran through the liquid pool. The soles of his shoes were damaged by the HF and his feet also needed a treatment with calcium gluconate.",
        "Emergency response": "The 2 victims were removed to a hospital. 1 victim left the hospital on the same day.The whole building, providing accommodation to 2 different companies, needed to be evacuated until the next morning.\u200bAs the production hall couldn't be entered without wearing a gas suit, 7 different municipal fire brigades were asked to send their firemen with gas suits. Those firemen cleaned up the production hall until 9 o'clock pm. The small amounts of HF that were left, were neutralised. An external crisis centre was installed 30 meters away from the production hall.",
        "Lesson Learned": "- No more lifting of IBC's with this type of stacker.- Changes in the design of the installation: IBC's are emptied using a pump and fixed pipework.- More consistent training of the operators- No more contractor employees allowed when hydrogen fluoride is being handled.- The contractor employee didn't receive any (safety) instructions from the company before entering the production hall. He was only told where to find the sanitary facilities."

        "Accident Description": "On 17 January 2012 hydrochloric acid (HCl) and bleach (sodium hypochlorite) were delivered to the electroplating plant. The chemicals were delivered in intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) by lorry. The filling operation was carried out (as usual) by two people. Investigations revealed that the hydrochloric acid pipe was connected to the correct fitting in the building. However, at the vehicle it was connected to an IBC containing bleach. (mixed equipment)\nConsequently, the hydrochloric acid container was filled with approximately 380 litres of bleach. As a result of the reaction between the two chemicals, chlorine gas was released via the air vent in the hydrochloric acid storage tank. This was noticed by the persons carrying out the filling operation, who then stopped the filling operation and manually activated the alarm. 38 people were injured as a result of the chlorine leak. The condition of the filling station in the building and its operation were technically sound.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause is human error (operator error): wrong connection fitting used.",
        "Consequences": "As a result of the reaction between the two chemicals, chlorine gas was released via the air vent in the hydrochloric acid storage tank.",
        "Emergency response": "- Evacuation alarm activated.\n- Rescue chain automatically alerted.\n- Immediate measures taken by company paramedic.\n- Support offered to emergency services by fire wardens and technical staff at electroplating plant. - Tank cleaned.\n- Chlorine gas readings taken.\n- Clearance measurements taken in building sections and clearance granted. - Inspection by firemen wearing airtight protective clothing.\n- Pressurised ventilation.\n- HCl tank assessed.\n- Cl gas value measured.\n- Clothing worn during emergency operation decontaminated.",
        "Lesson Learned": "To prevent tanks from being incorrectly filled in future due to such a mistake, the three connections on the different storage tanks have been fitted with electric valves which lock depending on the pH level. Consequently, acid is distinguished from bleach, preventing tanks from being incorrectly filled."

        "Accident Description": "In the production phase as a first step is produced polyvinyl acetate for polyvinilalcohol. On a alcoholysis band (rubber transport-band) took place an explosion: through the open inspection valve air arrived in the band-case, which together with the existing vapors (methanol and methylacetat, about 25 kg) created an explosive mixture. The releasing ignition spark arose obviously in the cutter, that is directly connected to the band and that during the inspection was on duty. Due to the explosion the shift leader died and the department head was injured. Immediately after the explosion got into fire the rubber-transport-band, part of the facing building front and the asphalted tar paper. The firemen brought the fire under control. The quenching water was collected in a vessel of the biological clarification plant, but about 7 kg of methanol arrived in the nearby river. Due to the explosion the polimerization from polyvinylacetate should be interrupted. Emergency disconnection caused a rupture of the rupture-disk and of the vessel which in turn provoked the escape of a mixture (1000 kg) of methanol and polyvinyl acetate circa 250 kg, leaked mixture flowing over the roof of the installation. The fire brigade ordered as a precaution the evacuation of the installation and of the neighbouring buildings. Dioxin analysis showed the usual values in burnt components.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Chemical reactionAir entered the fire box through the opened inspection hatches, which formed an explosive mixture with the vapours (methanol and methyl acetate, approx. 25 kg). The triggering spark apparently originated in the pre-cutter, which is immediately downstream of the belt and was in operation during the inspection.",
        "Consequences": "The shift leader was fatally injured and another three people injured.The rubber conveyor belt, parts of the remaining building facade and asphalt roofing felt on fire (property damage: &euro; 5 million).Outside the operating area, windows broke (property damage: &euro; 5,000).\n",
        "Emergency response": "The fire brigade brought the fire under control. The quenching water was collected in a vessel of the biological clarification plant, but about 7 kg of methanol reached a nearby river. Externally the fire brigade broached early the involved building and other adjacent installations and office buildings.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Inspection valves can not be opened, if the entire band-case is not flushed by nitrogen. A sensor examined the methanol and methylacetate concentration. For maintenance works the band-case should stay idle and through blowing-out by water is prepared for reparation; an inspection of the band-case during running cutter and running mill in future is technically possible; besides this in future running polymerization can be finished by the fact that the measurement values open the central quick-shut-valves for the passage of the methanol."

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nTaking also into account witnesses who heard a first big explosion and a few seconds later two other more suffocated explosions, it was deduced that most likely the empty tank No 43 exploded first causing the explosions of tanks No 44 and 45. The explosions of tanks No 44 and 45 were followed by the fire of the contained methanol. Tank No 42 was also partially damaged because of the explosion of the adjacent No 43: it was still emitting hexane vapours during the inspection. Probably the explosion was caused by the ignition of a mixture of residual methanol vapours with air formed during the degassing operations of tank No 43 (it was degassed with air in order to recover nonane). When the explosion occurred, five workers were working on degassing operations: after the accident, three dead bodies had been recovered and another worker was missed (his lifeless body was found a few days later). On the basis of the positions in which their bodies were found, they were presumably on top of the tank No 43, near to an open man-hole. The last worker, heavily injured, had been found in the pump-room and was hospitalized. According to Carmagnani's officials the tank's cleaning was considered a routine operation: depending on the substances to remove, water or air were used for cleaning purposes. In case of purging with water, washing water gathered by a draining system was conveyed to a waste-water treatment plant. In case that two incompatible substances had to be loaded subsequently into the same tank, purging with air was used (air was pumped in the vessel through a man-hole and was discharged from other openings). This situation occurred for tank No 43 because methanol residues were considered incompatible with nonane that had to be stored. All purging operations were normally carried out without neither nitrogen protection nor by monitoring the surrounding environment for the presence of flammable gases. No fixed explosimeter or smoke detectors were installed but the operators could make use of portable explosimeters and personal protection devices (breathing apparatuses, filters, masks). The first aid room was equipped with stretches and medical supplies and fire extinguishers were placed as laid down under the Fire Brigade's Regulations.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nThe ignition of an explosive methanol vapours/air mixture occurred inside an empty tank likely during degassing operations (the tank was degassed with air in order to recover nonane).\n\nCAUSES:\nThe ignition of an explosive methanol vapours/air occurred inside an empty tank likely during degassing operations (the tank was degassed with air in order to recover nonane because it was supposed to be incompatible with methanol). The operation was carried out without neither nitrogen protection nor by monitoring the presence of flammable gases. No fixed explosimeter or smoke detectors were installed but the operators could make use of portable explosimeters and personal protection devices (breathing apparatuses, filters, masks).\n",

The following day it turned out that tank D102a was insulated with white asbestos, part of which was blown away through the explosion. A small third explosion took place outside the tanks, because benzoic acid had streamed out of tank D102a. Due to a fragment of either one of the exploded tanks, tank D151 at approx. 40m. distance got a leak. This tank contained toluene which streamed into the tank pit. the explosions also created some fires around the tanks, and a big fire in a chemical waste depot. Some buildings and process equipment was damaged by several fragments.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The most probable cause was ignition of the explosive air/mixture by drilling or cutting activities. This happened following several human procedural errors which accumulated to the final result. These procedural errors concerned:- the contractors had all the necessary permits to do the job, but after investigation of the incident it became clear that the permits were issued on false grounds;- no explosion measurements had been carried out before permission was given to start work on the tank. In retrospect and after research had been done as as a result of the incident, it turned out that the safety awareness that benzoic acid is flammable and can possibly lead to explosion was not sufficiently known by DSM Chemical's employees.",
        "Consequences": "Casualties: 10 in total, namely: 6 persons killed by explosion; 1 person severely injured by explosion/fire and hospitalized (died later in spring 92); 3 persons lightly injured, but not hospitalized.Material damage: approximately 7.5 million Euros in total, varying from broken windows to a completely destroyed plant.

        "Causes of the accident": "\nMAIN FACTORS WITH DESIGNATION OF SEQUENCEtechnical defect in the process,loss of control over the external cause processfailure to supply cooling water,organizationALhuman factoroperator error - unconscious neglectThe direct cause of the propylene leak was a loose flange connection at the inlet of the safety valve located on the pipeline bridge.The main cause of loose flange joints between the safety valve and its shut-off valve was the excessive and devastating vibrations caused by the turbulence of the safety valve. The main cause of excessive and destructive vibration was most likely resonance induced by the acoustic standing wave on valve discharge and natural frequency. The calculations show the resonance with the outlet pipe. While other factors may have a causal effect on the occurrence of chatter (eg low flow) and subsequent vibrations (eg pipeline support project), the massive vibration intensity with such a devastating force, as evidenced by the extent of damage to the safety valve, could only be attributed phenomenon such as acoustic resonance.\n\nThe main cause of the furnace fire was the crack on the sixth hairpin, which was not properly cooled by process steam. Following a crack on the filament, a hydrocarbon flashing occurred in the reaction section and in the hot section and then the flare of the hydrocarbons in the conventional section and the spray line, and finally the washing oil flare as the furnace separated from the hot section to ensure that the hot section was secured before the next fire of the other portions of the ethylene unit .The main cause of improper cooling of the furnaces after emergency shutdown was the loss of process steam when two high-pressure steam boilers for the ethylene unit were dismantled and at the same time lost the steam import for the furnaces after heavy explosive burns caused by the tearing of the medium pressure steam pipe into the pipeline bridge .",

        "Accident Description": "On Saturday 25/04/2015 at about 13h00, a major leak occurred as a result of the catastrophic failure of the nuts on the studs connecting the bonnet and the body of a 2\u201d manual drain valve in a blow down line. The bonnet was ejected from the valve body, creating a 2\u201d opening in the system to atmosphere. Nobody was injured and no ignition of the flammable gas occurred.\nThe system was stopped, isolated and decompressed to flare. At around 18h00, the pressure in the system has dropped sufficiently to start maintenance works to replace the damaged valve. In total about 45 tons of flammable gas was released to atmosphere.",
        "Causes of the accident": "History of 2\u201d drain valveLittle information is available about the history of the 2\u201d drain valve. This valve is not used during normal operation of the unit, only during startup (connection for flushing with nitrogen).The following information is available:\nThe line was originally installed in 1984;o Works were done on the system in 2003;\nThe valve is installed at a height of about 4 meters above grade;o Works on this type of valves can only be done during turnarounds;\nThe construction of the valve (bonnet kept in place with 4 bolts) does not allow works to be done in run;\nThere are no records about repairs of the valve;o According to the original specifications, the 2\u201d drain valves should be a carbon steel drain valve. However, the installed valve is a stainless steel valve.\nIt is not clear whether the valve that failed on 25/04/2015 is the originally installed valve or whether the original valve has been replaced or worked on during one of the turnarounds between 1984 and 2015. Possibly, the carbon steel nuts were installed during one of these turnarounds. As a result of previous incidents with valve packing followers, a visual verification of isolation valves in stainless steel systems was launched prior to the incident on 25/04/2015. The 2\u201d drain valve that failed on 25/04 was in the scope of this verification and some comments were reported about the status of the valve:\nNo ice formation o Corrosion of bolts\nIncident investigation results\nInvestigation of the failed valve shows clearly advanced corrosion of the nuts of the studs connecting the bonnet and body of the valve. The following construction materials were encountered:o The bonnet and body of the valve are constructed from austenitic stainless steel (316);\nThe valve is installed on a line constructed of low temperature carbon steel;\nThe 4 studs used to connect the bonnet and body of the valve are constructed of ferritic stainless steel (410);\nThe 8 nuts on the studs connecting the bonnet and body of the valve are constructed of carbon steel;The following conclusions can be drawn upon investigation of the recovered valve:\nThe severe corrosion of the 8 carbon steel nuts on the 4 stainless steel studs/valve (see Figure 8) is consistent with a combination of galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion of the nuts.\nThe 4 stainless steel studs of the valve bonnet/body connection are in good condition.o Some of the nuts are missing because they were torn off during the ejection of the valve bonnet.o It is possible that the severely corroded nuts (including the missing nuts) were all located at the same side of the valve bonnet/body connection (back side).\nAccording to the original specification, the 2\u201d drain valve should have been a low temperature carbon steel valve instead of a stainless steel valve.o Besides carbon steel nuts on the studs of the valve bonnet/body connection, carbon steel nuts were also discovered on the studs of the valve flange/body connection (the 8 nuts on the blind flange are a mix of carbon steel nuts and stainless steel nuts. The carbon steel nuts are corroded.).\nUpon ejection of the bonnet of the 2\u201d drain valve, the bonnet hit a nearby propylene pipeline. This propylene pipe was hit in an horizontal plane above the horizontal plane of the original location of the 2\u201d drain valve, suggesting that the nuts that failed first were the ones located on the bottom half of the bonnet/body connection.\nExtensive corrosion of carbon steel nutsThe catastrophic failure of the carbon steel nuts of the valve bonnet/body connection occurred because of severe corrosion of the carbon steel nuts on the stainless steel studs.The extensive corrosion of the carbon steel nuts is a combination of galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion.\nInstallation of stainless steel valve with stainless steel studs in low temperature carbon steel line\nThe line was originally installed in 1984. According to the original specification, the 2\u201d drain valve should have been a low temperature carbon steel valve. However, the installed valve was made of austenitic stainless steel (316). It is possible that the valve that failed is the originally installed valve.\nInstallation of carbon steel nuts on stainless steel studs of stainless steel 2\u201d valveWorks on this type of valves can only be done during turnarounds since the construction of the valve (bonnet kept in place with 4 bolts) does not allow works to be done in run. There are no records about repairs of the valve (records were checked until 1998). It is not clear whether the valve that failed on 25/04/2015 is the originally installed valve or whether the original valve has been replaced or worked on during one of the turnarounds between 1984 and 2015. Possibly, the carbon steel nuts were installed during one of these turnarounds.\nValve in humid environment\nThe valve is constantly in a wet environment due to the condensation of water vapor in ambient air. The presence of this wet environment is a necessary condition for both galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion to occur (presence of electrolyte).\nNuts not protected against atmospheric corrosionThe carbon steel nuts were not protected against atmospheric corrosion (e.g. by paint or selection of corrosion resistant material).\nNuts in carbon steelThe nuts used to tighten the stainless steel studs were made of carbon steel.\nCondensation of water vapor in airThere is a constant condensation of water vapor in air at the location of the valve due to the low temperature of the fluid in the low temperature carbon steel line and because of the lack of thermal insulation on the valve.\nInstallation of valve not meeting specificationsIt is not unusual to install equipment parts made of more noble materials in systems made of less noble materials, provided that the compatibility of the materials is checked and that appropriate measures are taken to avoid galvanic corrosion.\nValve not thermally insulatedThe valve is installed in a thermally insulated low temperature carbon steel line. The valve as such was not insulated.\nProcess at -6\u00b0C. The valve is installed in an insulated low temperature carbon steel line. The operating temperature of the fluid in the line is about -6\u00b0C.\nInspection of lineThe 2\u201d drain valve was part of lines that are inspected inside the RBI scope. The line with the valve that failed was assessed to lie in the low risk area of the RBI matrix. The lines in this low risk area are inspected by visual verification of the state of the line during site visits (frequency of these visits is every 5 years).An inspection report of this particular line from a previous inspection cycle (2009) is available. This line was scheduled to be subjected to a more detailed inspection (with thickness measurements etc.) in the next inspection cycle (to be carried out in the turnaround of 2016). A request of this more detailed inspection was applied in a pre-inspection report of end 2014. The state of the valve that failed was insufficiently detected in the visual inspections of 2009.",
        "Consequences": "Large flammable gas cloud in the instalaltion. No ignition.\nThe accident occured during a weekend, so no maintenance work was in progress.\nWind direction was fortunately such that the cloud was directed toward a part of the installation that was out of service.",
        "Emergency response": "13.00\nAlarm by gas detectors in the area.\nA major leak is being reported that cannot be approached.\nIntervention team is installing a water screen for dilution of the vapor cloud\nActivation of emergency stops of different parts of the installation by Central Control Room operators due to multiple gas alarms and after confirmation of internal fire brigade\nEvacuation alarm is given\nPhase 2 of the internal emergency plan is activated. 13.55\nMonitoring of pressure profiles allows diagnosing were the leak is situated. This diagnose is confirmed by visual observations outside by maintenance and production people. The exact location of the leak is fine-tuned to be on a 2\u201d drain valve on a blow down line.\nThe lead is isolated. Since there is no isolation valve between the section with the leak and the next section both have to be emptied to stop the leak. 15.00\nThe pressure in the system has fallen from 32 bar to 2.4 bar 18.00\nThe pressure drops quickly to \u00b1 0.1 bar after opening of a blow down.\nScaffolding is erected and the leaking 2\u201d valve is replaced. The replaced 2\u201d valve with studs and nuts is recovered for further investigation.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Development of PMI program (Positive Material Identification)\nQuality control of delivered materials and equipment parts.\nQuality control of installed materials in the field by additional controls (e.g. supervision, Positive Material Identification). Organization of campaign to raise awareness about galvanic corrosion\nDuring the incident investigation, it became clear that the risks associated to galvanic corrosion are not always clearly understood by all layers of the organization. To raise understanding and awareness about galvanic corrosion hazards, a sensibilisation campaign needs to be organized by the site. Development of formal protocol for visual inspection of valves\nThere is no formal procedure describing the visual inspection of equipment. To improve the quality of visual inspections during site visits, a formal protocol needs to be developed to describe the requirements related to visual inspection. This formal protocol needs to include specific a measurable acceptance criteria for each of the inspected equipment. Gas detection\nThe gas detection system in the installation gave a quick warning of the leak allowing prompt action by the unit operators. It took a long time to depressurise the section of the installation with the leak. Partly because of the white cloud formed by the leak that didn't allow visual verification of the leak origin. Partly because there was no block valve on the top of the destillation colomn to which the leaking valve was connected. Therefore also the following equipement needed to be depressurised. The need for an additional block valve is still under investigation."

        "Accident Description": "At 07:30 on 16 November 2018, the fire detectors installed in the vitamin B6 production building activated the fire alarm on the third floor.Immediately afterwards, the evacuation alarm was sounded at 07:31 and the building was evacuated.The site fire brigade attended with two appliances. For safety reasons, water was sprayed onto the roof of the building to precipitate escaping vapours.As the safety valve of the affected reactor (on the roof) had tripped, any release of hydrogen cyanide via the roof had to be controlled. This made it possible to prevent a hazard for the surrounding area.\nThe site fire brigade then triggered a broader alarm and raised the alert state from level 1 to level 3. As a result, the operator\u2019s staff organisation and the municipal fire service of Grenzach-Wyhlen were alerted.The fire detector was triggered by the release of reaction mass from a container. In the production area, high concentrations of hydrogen cyanide in the ambient air were detected in the immediate vicinity of the release (beyond the measuring range of the portable 100 ppm detectors).In other parts of the building (other floors and the measuring station), the measurements remained in the lower range from 1 to 3 ppm.\nAt 07:54, the situation in the production area was under control. The containers concerned were not pressurised and the escaped reaction mass was distributed in the production area.At 08:00, a D2 message was sent to the Operations and Situation Centre and to the Freiburg regional government office, which was also informed by telephone.At the same time, a press release was issued to the local press.\nThe industrial measurements team measured hydrogen cyanide at various measuring points around the site. At all measuring points, zero was measured, including on the site of a neighbouring company, where a person claimed to have noticed a bitter almond smell shortly beforehand.\nThe police arrived at 08:24 and conducted interviews as appropriate. In consultation with the divisional police commander, it was confirmed that there was no need to alert the population.A conversation was held with the municipality at 08:50 to ensure that information was flowing as it should.\nAt 08:35, the D2 final notification was given. A final press release was issued at 09:05.The main part of the building concerned was released by the fire brigade at 09:07. Part of the staff organisation continued to work from that time until 18:00.Until then, further information on the state of play was sent to the Freiburg Regional Government Office.From 18:00, the plant was brought into safe condition, following a prior risk analysis, and then switched off. The contaminated roof with a gravel layer was covered with a tarpaulin so that rain would not wash the contamination into the rainwater system.\nCause/sequence of eventsThe oxazolamide in quinoline solution was supplied at a temperature of 146 \u00b0C (as in normal operation).As intended, it was then cooled to 90 \u00b0C. 1,375 kg of phosphorus pentoxide was added as intended from a steel container via a charging hopper.\nDuring the dosing process there was an exceptionally exothermic reaction in the stirrer container with a temperature above 203 \u00b0C and pressure rise of more than 0.5 bar.This led to the release of reaction mass via the feed line into the production site and the scrubber system.The safety valve on the roof also tripped.\nA quantity of approximately 500 to a maximum of 900 litres (conservatively estimated) of reaction mixture was released. This consists of: approx. 45% quinoline, 40% oxazolnitril/oxazolamide, 15% phosphoric acid / phosphorus pentoxide. Traces of hydrogen cyanide are also present in this mixture.\nSafety measures:After the phosphorus pentoxide was introduced into the stirrer tank, the shut-off valve (gate) of the stirring tank closed. A safety valve tripped due to the further pressure build-up in the stirrer tank.The fire alarm was triggered by the release of the reaction mass in the production area. The fire brigade used water to precipitate vapours around the safety valve.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The investigation into the root cause or analysis of the event follows various sources of error and cause. The possible causes are:\n\nproblems with the quality of raw materials (phosphorus pentoxide, quinoline);\na different composition of the intermediate product and thus the composition of the reaction mixture in the reactor involved;\nwater as a trigger for the violent reaction with phosphorus pentoxide;\noperational errors in the operation of the installation in question.\n\nThese possible issues give rise to different hypotheses, of which any one or several in combination may be the cause of the event. The facts and results have been analysed in a cause map.\nThe most likely cause of the event is the abnormal composition of the intermediate stage (excessive residual water moisture) in combination with the reduced drying due to the incorrect indication on the pressure gauge. This means that sufficient water was still available to react vigorously with the phosphorus pentoxide and possibly also with the oxazolnitril that had already formed.\nCombination of technical failure (pressure indicator) with previous abnormalities in the process.",
        "Consequences": "As a precaution, one person was sent to the occupational health service and observed there. No health impairment was found.\nContamination of the inside of the building.Costs: EUR 100,000",
        "Emergency response": "Fire brigade alerted and emergency response activated. Evacuation of the building, cordoning off and securing, fire brigade's firefighting water retained. Municipal fire brigade alerted. Measurements by industrial measurement teams of pollutants inside and outside the operational area.\nSupport with staff wearing respirators and liaison with the municipality.",
        "Lesson Learned": "A number of measures to make the process safer have been identified. Measures will also be implemented that do not affect the actual, most likely cause, but also further minimise all other possible and conceivable risks due to technical defects and operator errors. This will further reduce the residual risk.\nAn analytical control of the approach to oxazolnitril (in-process control) for the water content immediately prior to the addition of phosphorus pentoxide is important here. If water in this process can be sufficiently excluded by analysis, an uncontrolled reaction of water with phosphorus pentoxide cannot occur.The sampling point will be selected in an appropriate manner and the method of analysis will be qualified according to the current standard.\nIn addition, various additional level measurements will be installed in the installation and piping system to indicate the presence of water from cooling backflows, etc. and to alert staff promptly."

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nA corroded pipe in the degassing system ruptured after the wrong admission of liquid vinyl chloride and a leakage of about 4 tonnes of this substance occurred before its isolation. A layer of the escaped gas developped close to the drain ditches of the area where the leakage occurred. The vinyl chloride vapours, being 2.5 times heavier than air, remained closed to the ground. The slightly elevated rails of the railway serving the area acted initially as a dike and contained the gas cloud. Atmospheric conditions and  water curtains created by the plant fire brigade managed to contain the cloud close to the leakage point until it had been diluted by convection. The evaporation of liquid vinyl chloride had been promoted by the water draining from the water curtains. The source of the release was identified 45 minutes after the leakage was detected; the leaking pipeline was isolated soon after that. The company firemen checked the roads around the factory with explosimeters and the response was negative everywhere. Besides, they irrigated the area where the leakage occurred and made a screen from each side. The Security chief called Service 100 to signal the leak and to ask the firemen to take up position around the factory in case gas layer moved to the outside. Sambreville fire brigade was called and took position around the plant fence on the side opposite the site of the leak but its intervention was not necessary, since repeated gas concentration measuremets at the boundary of the factory resulted negative. The railway traffic in the city of Jemeppe was interrupted during the accident, from 23:32 till 03:08 next morning. The goods trains were stopped where they were whilst the international traffic was diverted via Brussels. The leakage had been detected at 23:10, the leaking point had been identified at 23:55 and the piping isolation took place around 00:05. From this moment, the leakage was decreasing until the gas cloud was practically dispersed at 01:30.

        "Accident Description": "As part of maintenance work, a paddle stirrer in the secondary fermenter was replaced by an external firm on 18 July 2017.In preparation for this, the substrate was pumped out of the container and the feed, stirrer and heating were shut down as of 11 July 2017 in order to suspend gas production.\nThree days before the start of the works, the tank cover was opened for ventilation. A few hours before starting installation, the contractor commenced forced ventilation with a fan.\nFirst, the old stirrer was dismantled on 17 July 2017. On 18 July 2017, the new stirrer was installed. Since the design is such that only final assembly of the individual parts in the container can take place, it was assembled there piece by piece. Before assembly, gas was measured directly above the substrate and in the working area.During assembly, measurements were constantly taken in the working area.\nIn order to fit the third of four parts, the stirrer had to be rotated and became immersed in the substrate. The next part was then fitted.\nIt is very likely that gas was released from the substrate and was then ignited by drips from welding. This then caused a fire involving sulphur deposits, lining and individual wooden boards of the cladding.\nImmediately after ignition, brief fire-fighting attempts were made with a water hose provided, but these were quickly abandoned as a result of smoke formation in the tank and the fire brigade was called, which then took charge at the plant.\nSafety measures:Provision of safety staff and initial extinguishing attempts (running water), containers taken out of service and disconnected from the remaining parts of the plant.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Welding\nPresence of two different sets of operating instructions for the work carried out. The operator\u2019s instructions do not provide for such work, but the instructions of the company carrying out the work allow it subject to compliance with the safety measures.",
        "Consequences": "Damage to plastic pipes and parts of the container cover (lining and wooden boards) by the smouldering fire, gas cap damaged by removal during fire-fighting operations, second stirrer replaced because a cable was damaged.Costs: &euro; 65,000",
        "Emergency response": "Gas flare activated for additional gas extraction from the neighbouring fermenter, evacuation of the operator and the contractor\u2019s staff from the danger zone, alerting the fire brigade.About three hours after the event, at regular intervals (30 minutes), the plant operator carried out re-ignition checks (fire watch).&nbsp;\nExperts called in to assess the damage, which was to be repaired as soon as possible in order to return to the safe normal operation of the installation.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Arrange for repairs to be carried out only by trained professionals, and carry out future such or similar measures in the container only after it has been emptied and cleaned.\nPrompt repair of the secondary fermenter and transition to safe normal operation of the plant."

The fire brigade was notified by the operator.The inflatable membrane cover of fermenter I adjoining the technical/pump room then caught fire.The fire brigade was able to prevent the fire spreading to the adjoining fermenter II. The gas storage membrane was damaged, however, and biogas was able to escape.The fire did not cause any explosion or deflagration.The fire resulted in the release of 500 m\u00b3 of biogas and 10 m\u00b3 of fermentation substrate.The other components of the installation (post-fermenters 1+2, fermentation residue storage containers, the CHP and the emergency flare) were not damaged. An emergency power supply was guaranteed.The closest residential area is situated approximately 400&nbsp;m to the south-east of the biogas facility.The fire spread from the control panel in the pump room and spread upwards via the walls and ceiling of the room up to the gas storage membrane of fermenter I. An easterly wind helped the flames to spread to the gas storage unit of fermenter II.The gas contained in the gas storage units was combusted.A failure alert was generated on the operator's mobile phone.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Fire in the control cabinet in the technical / pump room.\n&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "2 membrane covers with parts of the clamping rails, 1 complete pump room, 3 complete control panels, 1 complete pump, 2 computers with screens and cabinet, 1 telephone, various office supplies and work tools, overheating of the epoxy resin coating of the container walls in the area of the technical room.",
        "Emergency response": "The operator first sought to extinguish the fire using a fire extinguisher, and then alerted the fire brigade; the gas pipelines were closed off.\nAfter the event:The substrate pipelines were closed off.The gas in the installation was combusted via the flare.\nThe containers have not been affected or subjected to heat. Gas production has been reduced to a minimum.\nThe inflatable membrane covers of the other containers received an emergency power supply.\nClean-up and removal operations were carried out by a specialist firm (stripping of the pump room, etc.).\nRemoval of the released substrates, including the upper soil layer. Fermentation substrate (10 m\u00b3), liquid.\nThe water/foam from the fire extinguisher used to extinguish the fire was pumped away using an appropriate vehicle.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In order to prevent such an incident from recurring, smoke detectors are being fitted in the control panels and the technical room.If the smoke detectors are set off, power to the control panels will be cut and an alarm will be set off at a permanently occupied post.The technical room is being converted to fire-resistance class F90."

The gas warning system at Gate 1 triggered an automatic alarm to the emergency control room and to all staff at the plant.155 m\u00b3 of the cooking acid contained in the container could thus be pumped into an empty digester, with the result that only 10 m\u00b3 of cooking acid escaped into the catch pan.The plant\u2019s own water curtains were immediately set up. The fire brigade was very quickly at the scene and closed a main road passing in front of the site.The safety system worked very well.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The release was caused by the corrosion of a stainless steel clad DN 80 blind flange on a cooking acid container.The most likely mechanism is mechanical damage to the welded stainless steel cladding, which allowed cooking acid to reach the underlying black steel.Corrosion of the black steel was able to continue undetected until it burned through the blind flange. This was followed by a very rapid erosion of the material and a widening of the corrosion hole.The cooking acid container was built in 1965. The extent to which the blind flanges also date back to that year is unknown, but it cannot be ruled out.The tank was originally constructed as a digester and was sold second-hand many years ago to the current plant operator, where it has since been used as a high pressure (approximately 7 bar) storage tank.There was no monitoring of the blind flanges.",
        "Consequences": "Three injured workers.",
        "Emergency response": "Staff were alerted by internal gas sensors so that the leak was quickly detected. Installation of the plant\u2019s own water curtains to reduce impacts. Blocking of access to the works by its own staff (with appropriate protective equipment). Automatic alerting of the emergency control room by gas sensors. Container emptied by pumping its contents into an empty digester, pumping of the cooking acid that had leaked into the catch pan to the evaporation system. Closure of a main road in front of the site and final clearance measurement by the fire brigade.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Replace the stainless steel clad blind flange cover with solid stainless steel flange cover on the container.Additional check on the thickness of the material and the weld on the lower cone of the container by an external specialist firm (non-destructive material test).Putting into service of the container only after further internal checks and strength testing by an authorised testing body.Wall thickness checks of similar clad blind flange covers in the lower pressure level containers and, if necessary, replacement with solid stainless steel blind flanges.The lessons learned from this event are complex:- The fact that undetected corrosion could take place shows the importance of identifying such potential sites and using appropriate non-destructive test methods on a regular basis. In this case, for example, sound emission tests would be one way of promptly detecting the formation of corrosion voids behind the cladding.- The age of the equipment certainly plays an important role, as more modern containers are usually equipped with 100% stainless steel blind flanges.- The lessons can also be applied to reactors with other corrosion-resistant coatings.- Where damage to the protective layer may occur, as a result of which the more sensitive layer is exposed and the damage is not detected in good time, a disastrous break-through and release of substances can occur. Accordingly, the maintenance and inspection plans relating to such systems must be reviewed and, if necessary, amended.- Aging installations for which complete history documentation may not be available must be treated with a commensurate level of caution.Examine whether additional gas sensors in the area of cooking acid treatment can help to locate leaks more quickly."

        "Accident Description": "In the evening of 8 August 2017, a fire broke out at a facility for the temporary storage of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and for treatment (in this case transfer of liquid waste only).The response teams of the competent fire brigades attended the scene immediately and were able to bring the fire under control during the night of 8 to 9 August 2017. The remaining ember nests were then monitored.The latter were the cause of a new outbreak of fire on 10 August 2017. However, this incident was very localised and less intense.\nIn an outdoor area to the northwest of the storage box system, there were containers that were empty but for residue (waste code 15 01 10 \u2013 butyl chloride; deposits on the container walls, as they are not rinsed or washed out), which melted due to the intense heat. During the fire extinguishing work on the newly ignited fire, the deposits then reacted with water, resulting in gas formation.\nOne building was affected by the event, along with the open storage boxes located on the western side and the immediately adjacent outdoor spaces in front of the access routes to each of the storage boxes.The roofing over the storage boxes collapsed due to the intense heat.The hazardous materials store and the office and staff rooms were not damaged.\nThere were a total of 11 casualties with minor injuries, such as skin irritation/rashes, and significant damage to property. A large amount of smoke was generated.Residents were therefore urged to close windows and doors. The fire brigade then carried out emission measurements over a wide area. It was established that there was no risk to humans and the environment.In addition, the fire brigades involved had only limited operational capability after the major operation, as some of the equipment was no longer usable and had to be replaced.\nSafety measures:The fire alarm system was triggered. An employee had already reported the fire by telephone.",
        "Causes of the accident": "According to the Criminal Police, this was a case of spontaneous combustion.",

        "Accident Description": "On 30 January 2000 at 22:00, the dam surrounding the waste lake at one of the sub-units belonging to Aurul SA in Baia Mare, north-west of Romania, ruptured. This caused a discharge of approximately 100,000 m3 of liquid and waste containing between 50 and 100 t of cyanide as well as heavy metals including copper. The rupture was probably caused by a combination of design errors of the facilities used by Aurul, unexpected operating conditions and adverse weather conditions. Contaminated run-off travelled through the S\u0103sar, L\u0103pu\u0219, Some\u0219, Tisa and Danube rivers before reaching the Black Sea 4 weeks later. Almost 2000 kilometres of the Danube and its tributaries were affected by the run-off.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The rupture in the dam was caused by a combination of intrinsic process design flaws and unforeseen operating conditions linked to adverse weather conditions. The pond wall was built using processed coarse-grade tailings, an operational method that requires a safe range between the height of the dam and the water level in the pond. In the case of the new pond at Baia Mare, there was an imbalance between the flow of solids and water on the one hand, and the increase in the storage capacity of the pond on the other, as the pond construction process could not keep pace with the rising water levels in the reservoir. The weather conditions of the winter season exacerbated the situation and led to an uncontrolled increase in the level of the pond and subsequently led to the spillage over the dam.",
        "Consequences": "Environmental factors were affected by the accident as both cyanide and heavy metals had an impact on aquatic fauna and polluted the drinking water.The methods used for the analysis of cyanide and heavy metals across the three countries affected produced comparable results in line with international standards. Differences in results emerged between Romanian and Hungarian scientists, but these can be explained by the time and place of the tests. Moreover, an independent test was carried out by the United Nations three weeks after the wave of harmful substances had passed and therefore cannot validate any of the results obtained by Romanian, Hungarian and Yugoslavian [sic] experts while the wave was passing.Results show that cyanide and heavy metals concentration levels decreased rapidly as the distance from the origin of the spill increased. The cyanide had acute effects on the long sections of the riverbeds to the point where the Tisa and Danube rivers meet. The plankton (plants and animals) was wiped out by the passing cyanide wave and fish died during or immediately after the cyanide wave passed. In Hungary, lead, copper, manganese and iron levels were found to be very high at several points along the Tisa and Mure\u0219 rivers. In the Mure\u0219 river, which was not affected by the spillage, lead levels were found to be four times higher than the acceptable level. In Yugoslavia [sic], on the stretch before the intersection of the Tisa and the Danube, the concentration of lead was found to be very high. Manganese and iron levels were found to be slightly higher in certain parts of the Tisa. Similarly zinc levels were found to be slightly higher in certain parts of the Danube.",
        "Emergency response": "In the hours and days following the accident, the following measures were taken:\n\nlocal and central authorities were informed, as were the Hungarian authorities;\npartial closure of the dam (31 January 2000 - 2 February 2000, 1:30 a.m.) followed by the restoration and strengthening of the pond wall;\nneutralisation of leaked water with sodium hypochlorite;\nmonitoring water quality by carrying out systematic tests of rivers and sources of drinking water;\nsupplying inhabitants of Bozanta Mare with drinking water;\ndischarge of water from the Aurul pond into the Remin pond (situated nearby) and, after neutralisation, into the L\u0103pu\u015f river in order to maintain a constant level of water in the pond.\n\nThe measures taken by the Hungarian authorities included public warnings, work in the ponds and lakes to ensure the protection of tributaries and fauna, the temporary closure of the Kiskore dam (upper Tisa) to increase water levels and the temporary closure of the Tisa water intake for the city of Szolnok. The dam was reopened when the contaminated water arrived, in order to allow it to rapidly pass through, thus preventing the contamination of the lake and secondary watercourses.Yugoslavia received an official communication from Hungary about the leak on 3 February. Cooperation with Hungary was good throughout the leak incident. Yugoslavia began monitoring the leakage on 10 February and, concurrently, Yugoslav authorities launched a call for water companies to inform all consumers and to close all water supply points. Hydraulic gates prevented cyanide leakage from affecting secondary channels and watercourses along the Danube.A ban was placed on fishing and the sale of fish and publicly announced. Other preventive measures taken to protect public health were put in place, including the closure of Belgrade\u2019s water supply. The information exchanges between Romanian, Hungarian and Yugoslav authorities, as well as the measures taken by all three countries, including the temporary closure of the Tisa dam, reduced the harmful impact of the leakage.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nIncreased need for objective and accurate information, in particular from local authorities and the media, was identified. Communication channels must be improved and NGOs and other interest groups must contribute to informing the public.\nAn emergency plan for an improved system must be drawn up and made known to local workers and decision-makers. Organisational responsibilities with regard to future instances of dam ruptures must be made clear. Rapid-response emergency alarms must be put in place, especially in Baia Mare.\nIt is necessary to identify sources of drinking water in case of an emergency, to carry out a study on the health of the population living in the affected areas and to monitor diseases caused by water pollution. Last but not least, drinking water supply systems for private households in Maramure\u0219 County must be replaced by public supply systems, accompanied by waste treatment systems.\n"

Subsequently, the container was sealed. Thereafter, according to the operator, the cleaning work was interrupted for at least 2 days. During this time, as a result of the reaction of the dilute hydrofluoric acid with the iron material of the container, hydrogen was formed, so that an explosive atmosphere was formed. When the cleaning work resumed, the explosive mixture was ignited presumably by the sparking due to the work with an angle grinder.",
        "Consequences": "Fatalities: 2 personsInjuries:&nbsp; &nbsp;2 persons",
        "Emergency response": "In-house staff reported the accident to the company fire service command centre. The fire brigade was immediately deployed. An ambulance and a rescue vehicle from the local fire brigade were called as the company fire service was on its way. The injured were attended to by both the works rescue service and the company medical staff while the situation was assessed. A further ambulance and rescue vehicle were called in. Measures were taken to resuscitate the injured. The site was cordoned off and cleared of unauthorised persons. Measurements at the tank opening did not reveal any significantly elevated readings.&nbsp;",
        "Lesson Learned": "As a measure, it was stated that technical safety provisions (suction) are to be provided to prevent the formation of an explosive atmosphere inside the containers. Maintenance can then take place with the exhaust air switched on."

        "Accident Description": "No 5 gas holder was commissioned on December 3, 1991 to allow for winter demand patterns. On December 12, the steam antifreeze system was commissioned to prevent cup water seals freezing in cold weather. Cup water levels were checked and found satisfactory. Personnel visited the site on December 13 and checked the antifreeze boiler and pipework. Reported as satisfactory at 16:16 hrs. On December 14, the cup seal of the top lift of No 5 LP Holder blew. Personnel arrived on-site on December 14 to carry out the daily check on the antifreeze steam boiler. They found a large escape of steam at the base of the riser leading up the side of the holder, and called out maintenance assistance. When the steam supply was isolated, a further noise was heard, which was traced to the top cup seal on No 5 gas holder (from holder height telemetry records, it was subsequently shown that a sudden increase in rate of stock loss occurred at about the time that personnel arrived on-site but no connection exists). Gas was being boosted from the LP Holders and the rate of stock change was inside those of previous winter patterns. Further personnel were called to site, including management, and the Off-site Plan was initiated resulting in fire brigade and police attendance. Despite using fire tender's assistance, water could not be re-introduced to the cup seal and the holder descended until the seal was immersed in the holder water tank when all gas leakage stopped. The gas cloud dispersed without igniting.",

It is believed that a combination of freezing overnight temperature, followed by temperature rise, and the steam leak forming condensate in the flexible hoses leading to the top seal (which in turn produced a syphon as the gas holder was elevated towards full stock) were the causes. No other causes were found (a split in the cup holder bottom has been estimated less likely). Subsequent checks showed no leakage from the cup itself. Safety system (low level alarm) did not intervened.",

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nThe accident occurred during the distillation of crude ortho-nitrobenzaldehyde. Six months prior to the final processing the material was oxidized with nitric acid and the products set aside. This led to the formation of appreciable amounts of thermally unstable ortho-nitrobenzylnitrate being formed. This was not recognized and resulted in an earlier exotherm and more vigorous acceleration than had been anticipated. However, immediately prior to distillation, a sample of the crude product was tested using a differential scanning calorimetry method to determine the temperature at which an exothermic reaction would begin. The crude had been washed with water, toluene and caustic prior to testing but the test equipment differed from that specified, and the condensation of water within the equipment masked the identification of an exothermic reaction in the sample. With the information from the test indicating that there was no exotherm likely at and around the operating temperature, the process of distillation of the bulk material was started. At about 140",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:An exothermic reaction accelerated to deflagration shattering the distillation vessel and causing widespread damage to the premises and some damage to the surroundings.CAUSESThe explosion of the vessel was caused by an exothermic runaway reaction accelerated to a deflagration. The runaway reaction occurred due to the formation of appreciable amounts of the thermally unstable o-nitrobenzylnitrate during the storage (6 months long) of the crude material (o-nitrobenzaldehyde). The formation of o-nitrobenzylnitrate was unexpcted due to an inadequate process analisys and the risk of a runaway reaction was not recognized because the laboratory analysis on a sample of the crude product were carried out in a wrong way.",

        "Accident Description": "On 16 November 2010 at approximately 11:00 there was an explosion/deflagration and subsequent fire in the reactor chamber of a CPon plant. As soon as the gas warning sensors were triggered, the plant team immediately began to wind down the reactor using an elevated flare and to activate the reactor chamber's vapour barrier. Within 2-4 minutes, the alerted fire-brigade was on site and began cooling the lower third of the reactor area. As the leaking fluid (cyclopentene/cyclopentane) evaporates easily, instead of directly extinguishing the flames, the material was allowed to burn out in a controlled fashion. Around 15:30 the flames burned out in the reactor chamber and the residues from the process were burned with the elevated flare. The incident was confined to the reactor chamber. There was no harm to people or the environment. The material damages were concentrated on the reactor area, the compartmentation of which prevented the fire from spreading to other parts of the plant. At the time of the incident, there were around 40 t of a mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons in the reactor.\nAround 10% of the mixture (rough estimate) leaked out through a break point caused by the explosion and was burnt.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "Operation-associated: the final conclusion is that the ignition of a detonatable mixture and probably very small amounts of air led to a detonation in the area of the block and bleed system in the dispensing equipment. Adiabatic compression of gas is seen as the possible cause of the ignition. The day before the incident (15 November 2010), a block valve on the reactor side was replaced. During its installation air probably got into the pipe section between the block valve on the reactor side and a second block valve, and the pipeline between the block valve on the reactor side and a control valve was probably then filled with cyclopentene (CPen) residue in gas or liquid form. This means that before the start of the nitrous oxide dosing, the relevant pipe section probably had a mixture of CPen residues and air of an unknown composition. The accident investigation concluded that the ignition of an explosive mix of nitrous oxide, cyclopentene/cyclopentane and probably very small quantities of air led to an explosion in the area of the block and bleed system of the nitrous oxide dosing of the CPon plant sector. There were also comprehensive investigations to determine the source of ignition as the potential trigger for the explosion. In two points, adiabate compression following the opening of the nitrous oxide valves could have created local hotspots. Adiabatic compression is considered as the possible cause of the ignition. No individual person actively made a mistake. The relatively new process, which is still being patented, and the low level of knowledge about the substances or mixture properties, particularly the mass explosiveness of nitrous oxide / cyclopentene mixtures is considered as the cause.\n",
        "Consequences": "-\tConcrete wall damaged by the heat of the fire.\n-\tFire damage to electrical equipment.\n-\tValves and pipeline sections at the site of the explosion destroyed. Damage/cost: \u20ac500 000",

        "Finish Date": "2004-06-26 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "There was a fire in the pre-heating oven of the gas-oil hydrodesulphuration unit for the of the refinery.\n\nThe accident is classified at level 4 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Comity of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive (level 3 for the evacuation of 600 persons; level 2 for the quantities of substances released by the accident and level 4 for the resulting costs).\nThe accident:On 26 June 2004 at 16.38, a fire broke out on oven 42F201. Large flames enveloped the oven (the metal of the convection part became red-hot) and gave off black smoke. The fire does not appear to have been preceded by an explosion, but by a suspicious noise, described by witnesses as a whistling noise (as of a valve) growing more and more intense, and then a \"mechanical\" noise.Staff working on a neighbouring unit quickly released alarm and had already manually activated part of the water curtains by the time the safety teams intervened. The operator then cut off supplies to the unit (load and hydrogen) and started decompression to the flare, which was successful in rapidly reducing the combustion. The structures supporting the oven and subjected to intense heat flow were cooled.The external fire was brought under control in 30 minutes using the onsite emergency response services of the refinery. The external emergency response services dispatched to the scene did not need to intervene. The combustion of the products from the reactor loop (reactor 42R202) continued at a high level of intensity for several hours in the convection chambers of the oven and the flues at the outlet of the latter.The output of the common chimney collecting the emissions to the atmosphere of the HDS units, atmospheric distillation no. 2 (DA2) and extraction of aromatics (hydrogen treatment section no.&nbsp; 2 - HDT2) was seen to produce flames intermittently for several minutes accompanied by a considerable plume of smoke.None of the detectors of ambient H2S on the unit triggered an alarm. In contrast, it is probable that a certain quantity of&nbsp; H2S was released at the flare.Among the pollutants monitored continuously by the detectors in the neighbourhood of the refinery (air quality measurement network of the Lyon conurbation), sulphur dioxide and in particulates suspension are likely to register peaks in cases of incidents of this nature. The concentrations measured showed no significant increase (they remained below the threshold of information and recommendations for sensitive persons).",
        "Causes of the accident": "Inspection plan of the oven:The inspection plan of the oven in force at the time of the accident allows intervals for periodic inspections of 6 years and intervals for periodic requalification of 12 years according to a amendment granted by the DRIRE on 8 November 2001, when setting out regulations applicable to pressurized equipment.With this in view, the inspection department of the refinery drew up the inspection plans of the pressurized equipment of this unit according to the method known as RBI (Risk Based Inspection) in conformity with the professional guidelines of the UFIP (Union Fran\u00e7aise des Industries P\u00e9troli\u00e8res) of February 2000, recognized by the administration by DM-T/P no.&nbsp; 31 538 of 20 October 2000.The application of the RBI method is based on a software program used in the Group, named \"RBeye\", which automates the search for types of deterioration as a function of data relating to the fluid and materials of the equipment, pressures and temperature. The oven has been subjected to periodic inspections from the start, with inspections every three years until 1997, and tests every ten years. The last periodic requalification with testing took place in April 2002, and was successful. It had thus been in service subsequently for 27 months at the time of the fire.The HDS unit was inspected at the time of the general shut-down in 2002 (\"metal\" shutdown) and was stopped in 2003 for a simple change of catalyst.The non-destructive tests performed since the start have consisted in measurement of thickness by ultrasound and dimensional inspections to check the absence of creep, all conducted on the radiation part, as the inspection department held that this was the most vulnerable. Since 1993, metallographic replica tests have been carried out on the radiation tubes and showed the beginnings of sensitization of the stainless steel (beginnings of corrosion which could lead to modification of the mechanical characteristics), but this was judged acceptable by the inspection department, in the absence of loss of cohesion or microfissures.On the convection part, only measurements of thickness of the peripheral elbows were made (see photo below), no anomaly being recorded. The inspection report of the periodic requalification performed in 2002 shows that, on the convection part, the visual inspection carried out on the lower layer, according to the inspection department, revealed no anomalies. In this connection, the history of the thickness measurements on the radiation tubes and convection elbows since 1993 shows no abnormal reduction of thickness.For obvious design reasons, it is impossible to inspect the interior of the tubes.The periodic requalification was accompanied by a hydraulic test carried out a pressure of 85.5 bars.Before the fire, the HDS had been operating since the previous day in \"domestic heating oil\" mode, a rate of operation considered as moderate. It was fed with a mixture of light distillate from vacuum distillation unit no. 2 and LCO (light gas-oil rich in cyclics) from the catalytic cracker unit. The sulphur content of the load was estimated at 1.16%. It should be noted that before being introduced into oven 42F201, this received an addition of hydrogen contributing to the desulphuration reaction. According to the records, the skin temperature of oven 42F201 was stable in the region of 373\u00b0C, the maximum permissible temperature being 392\u00b0C (set point).Origin of the fire:The tubes constituting the lower convection layer were found not to have melted, having seemingly been supplied to the end by the load and thus \"cooled\". Among these, one tube found to have burst (a clean break of 500 mm), has since been thought to have been the origin of the fire.Expert examinations performed:Two expert examinations were carried out, one by an external expert, the other by the Group's research centre.Expert examination by the external expert:This was carried out on 2 tubes (the burst tube and a neighbouring tube) on the basis of a geometrical, fractographic and metallurgical analysis of the burst tube and of mechanical tests and analyses by X-ray diffraction.This revealed that the rupture was caused by four types of deterioration, the effects of which had cumulatively led to a reduction of thickness to a point below that at which the tube could withstand operating pressure.These types of deterioration are as follows:- aggression supposedly due to exposure to polythionic acids: these acids form when the sulphurised constituents of the load are in contact with oxygen. This situation cannot occur in normal operation, as the load contains no oxygen. It is encountered during shutdowns or hydraulic tests. To avoid this phenomenon, a passivation operation is performed during the shutdown process (a procedure formalized since 1985). This aggression is thought to be old, as passivation has been performed since 1980. It results in the localized formation of grooves in the inside of the tubes of the oven.- reduction of thickness by oxidation/sulphuration: in the grooves formed by the polythionic acid aggression, the material (austenitic stainless steel) had lost its unoxidizable character, leading to a reduction of thickness by corrosion.- the presence of sigma phase (an intermetallic compound causing very marked fragility of the metal) in a low proportion, which may have facilitated the development and penetration of the intergranular attack.- loss of intergranular cohesion entailing slow creep which, in its turn, generates fissuring in the outer skin of the tubes: this phenomenon could be explained by poor heat exchange, due to a deposit of coke on the inside of the tube. This external deterioration of the tube was not visible to the naked eye.Expert examination by the Group's research centre:This examination conducted on another neighbouring tube revealed none of the characteristic appearance of internal intergranular corrosion found on the burst tube. However, on the outside, loss of cohesion due to creep, and on the inside, the presence of a considerable density of sigma phase were observed. The examination came to the conclusion that there were localized defects..",
        "Consequences": "Human consequences:Two operators were slightly injured during fire extinguishing operations (falls due to irregularities in the paving of the HDS unit hidden in foam).According to the public emergency reponse services, 600 persons were temporarily evacuated from an urban zone of Feyzin (including the swimming pool and the stadium). By way of precaution and in the absence of accurate information from the refinery, the Police Authorities temporarily closed the A7.Material consequences:The detailed assessment of the damage to the pressurized equipment affected by the incident was carried out according to the API 579 method, which consists in determining the temperature levels attained during the fire, the spatial classification of the 6 zones and the definition of a criterion of acceptance or replacement according to the zone concerned. The most significant damage was to the oven:&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total destruction of the convection bundle (melting of the upper convection layers; only the lower layer showed unmelted tubes including a burst tube) (see photo below),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melting and vitrification of the refractory on the convection part (see photo below), o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overheating of the radiation bundle, o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage or deformation of elements of walls and roof structure in convection and radiation,o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage to supporting columns, o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deformation of the bottom section of the flue. The incinerator adjacent to the oven at fault suffered damage to its supporting columns (damage to fire-resistant concrete). According to the operator, this damage is due to aging of the heat insulation. Supporting documentation was requested on this point. Other equipment was damaged by the incident: pipework mainly supplying combustibles and utilities to the oven, electric cables and measurement systems, three water curtain systems on other ovens, certain gas detectors, the loading lines and transfer lines of the oven situated in zone 5, together with all the pipework on the east rack and on the ground were not metallurgically affected by the fire because of their heat-insulation protection, the metal ladder of the oven is twisted, the support wall (concrete) of the flue linking the HDS unit to the chimney common to the HDS, DA2 and HDT2 units was damaged, flames were observed for several minutes at the outlet of the chimney common to units HDS, DA2 and HDT2, leading to the supposition of damage to this structure (the refractory in particular).&nbsp;At the monitoring platform for emissions from this chimney, a temperature peak of at least 500\u00b0C (the upper limit of detection) was recorded, the remainder of the recording being unusable due to damage to the sensor. Environmental consequences:A description and assessment of the consequences environmental consequences were carried out with respect to: o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the nature, quantities, composition and toxicity of the atmospheric emissions (H2S, SO2, dust),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the nature and quantities of the waste and polluted water, and the channels of disposal adopted.The data are given in detail in chapter 2.Economic consequences:The economic consequences are estimated at a total sum of about 28 million Euros, in particular:o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 250 000 Euros/day of loss of earnings (the production tool being out of action for 3 months),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 million Euros devoted to the repair of the unit, including 2 million Euros for rebuilding the oven as new.",
        "Emergency response": "The DRIRE launched an immediate administrative inquiry on 26 June 2004. Numerous contacts were made and meetings and dialogues organized by the departments in charge of the regulation of pressurized systems and those in charge of environmental questions, both local and regional.With a view to identifying the causes of this accident and taking the steps for restarting the HDS unit without risk, a Prefectoral order prescribing emergency measures, dated 30 June 2004, was communicated to the operator at the instigation of the DRIRE.Analysis of failures and causes:An examination of the chronology of the event (recordings of the alarm, of sensors, movements of valves, etc.), a description of possible advance indications and the list of special operations carried out in the course of the day were presented. Essentially, the following points emerge:- no irregularity in the process parameters before the accident and no warning sign is revealed by the analysis of the operation parameters of the HDS unit,- no malfunction in the automatic control and safety devices (independent systems) was identified.The failures and causes analysis was carried out by a multidisciplinary internal working group. The work session was steered by an expert guaranteeing the correct application of the fault-tree model, and who had not been involved in the management of the accident in question.Plant:- Checks and inspections were carried out on the equipment of the reactor loop downstream from the oven (reactor 42R202, exchangers 42E201 and 42E202A/B) which suffered abrupt decompression when the tube of the oven ruptured, although normal operation provides for the application of a very gradual depressurization procedure. Because of this, the internal cladding coatings (an internal cladding skin applied to the welding seams) or stainless steel double skins could have suffered a phenomenon of adhesion failure (disbonding by the hydrogen). No such anomaly was revealed.- the chimney, which had flames issuing from its top for several minutes, was subjected to thermographic checks, visual inspections of the crown by telescope and verification of verticality. It results that the concrete structure and its internal cladding (refractory brick) are in satisfactory condition and in conformity with construction specifications.- 34 lines were checked: o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pipework in zones 5 and 6, mainly the combustible and utility supplies to the oven, were replaced or eliminated (the new oven changed over to fuel gas only),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the loading and transfer lines of the oven situated in zone 5, together with all the pipework on the eastern rack and on the ground were not metallurgically affected by the fire because of their heat-insulation protection. The remedial work consisted of replacement of the bolting, joints, heat insulation and its protective metal sheeting, and the spring supports, - all the electrical cabling and measurement systems were completely overhauled, with replacement of damaged components,- all the valves and pumps were overhauled,- the water curtain systems of ovens 42F201 and 42F501 were entirely rebuilt, - the gas detectors were overhauled and replaced where necessary.- In view of the extent of the damage to the oven, the decision was taken to rebuild it new together with the associated civil engineering works (concrete support columns, first section of the flue). The reconstruction was almost identical to the original, though the following improvements were incorporated: o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 burners fitted instead of 4, enabling better distribution of the heat flow,o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remote ignition device for the burners included,o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; temperature sensors fitted on the outer skins of the tubes at two levels in the radiation part, and similarly on the lower layer of the convection part, for the purpose of monitoring any abnormal temperature increases that might be caused by build-up of coke in the inside,o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inclusion of supplementary man holes.Inspection plan:The inspection plan of the oven was revised to take into account the initial conclusions drawn from the expert examination, and provides for the following additional checks, made possible by the new design of the equipment: On the convection part:o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; replica tests and radiography of the convection tubes once per cycle, o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the next major shut-down in 2007 (after 25 000 h of operation): measurements of thickness of the tubes of the lower layer and 20 % of the peripheral elbows, geometrical calibration of the tubes (to look for creep), radiography (to look for internal corrosion and the presence of coke),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continuous monitoring of the skin temperature of the tubes.On the radiation part:o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checks of thickness on 20% of the tubes and elbows at each annual shut-down (replacement of the reactor catalyst),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the next major shut-down in 2007: measurements of thickness of the tubes and elbows, geometrical calibration of the tubes (to look for creep), metallographic replica tests on tubes at two different heights (to look for sensitization of the stainless steel),o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continuous monitoring of the skin temperature of the tubes at two heights.The inspections and periodic requalifications will be accompanied by verification of the safety accessories and the requalification of a hydraulic test.Passivation procedure:An internal working group was set up to re-examine the passivation procedure and the equipment likely to be concerned.Feedback from experience on other equipment or other units:There are no other desulphuration ovens on the site that could display this type of corrosion.According to the operator, the aggression by polythionic acids could also occur on the catalytic reformer, as also in unit HDT2 (hydrogen treatment) where, as a consequence of the geometrical constraints, passivation is not feasible. The DRIRE has nevertheless asked the operator to conduct more intensive investigations of these units to look for the possible&nbsp; presence of this phenomenon of corrosion.Examination of the accident case histories involving ovens in refineries (ARIA database compiled by BARPI) did not identify any similar accident (June 2005).",
        "Lesson Learned": "The accident is a reminder of the importance of certain problems relating to such aspects as detection, response (Onsite Emergency Response Plan), external communication and the limitations of the inspection plan of the installations.Detection and response:In the absence of fire detection on the HDS unit, staff who were present working on a neighbouring were able to raise the alarm very quickly and activate means of decompression and cooling of the in the next 5 minutes. This favourable circumstance must not be allowed to obscure the crucial importance of rapid detection of such an event, which conditions the time lag before the response of staff and the activation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan. Thus, in view of the reduction in numbers of staff in the immediate proximity of the installations for obvious safety raisons (a programme of construction of new control rooms remote from the units is in progress), the detection of accidental occurrences in the production units (detection of fire, gas, etc.) and the visual and auditory surveillance of the installations must be re-examined, without prejudice to the monitoring of the operating parameters.A study group was set up to clarify the modes of activation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan. The occurrence of 26 June 2004 has indeed raised questions regarding the formal implementation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan.It is also worth asking certain questions regarding the balance between the staff allocated to the production units and those needed for emergency response operations in case of an accident occurring. This aspect takes on particular importance outside working hours.In view of the human consequences of the fire of 26 June 2004, the decision was taken, at the request of the CHSCT, to repair the paving of the HDS unit. It would seem desirable to extend this measure to the whole of the plant.Inspection plan:The rupture of the tube that started the fire was a consequence of certain types of deterioration (coke deposit, attack by polythionic acids), which were not identified when the inspection plan was drawn up with the aid of the RBeye software program used by the Group.Further development of this tool would thus seem necessary so that it includes the modes of deterioration mentioned above and to take the age of the equipment into account in the criticality calculations. Deterioration of the tubes may also become apparent during hydraulic strength tests, provided the equipment is subjected to greater stresses than those occurring in normal service. If the initial strength test applied to the oven newly rebuilt in accordance with the decree of 13 December 1999 is suitable for addressing this concern, steps should be taken to ensure that this condition applies for similar ageing equipment.To verify the relevance of these measures, it might be interesting to make a comparison of the inspection plans for these units currently implemented in French refineries.External communication:During the crisis management operations, the information given by the operator concerning the gravity and the potential consequences of the accident, were considered as to be inadequate by the offsite services (Town Hall, Police, Emergency Response Services, Director of Sports Infrastructures, etc.).The operator, on the other hand, considers that the measures taken by the Authorities where exaggerated with regards to the nature of the occurrence. In terms of communication, a press conference was held by the director of the site on 26 June 2004 , the day of the accident, at 18.30.These diverging evaluations were examined after the event in a debriefing meeting at the Prefecture of the Rh\u00f4ne, which concluded that there was a need: - to improve the organization of crisis management between the Town Hall of Feyzin, the Police Authorities and the refinery,- for the operator, to formalize in his alert procedures the notion of \"events visible from the outside\", comprising a fast, systematic means of informing the Authorities, even in cases where the Onsite Emergency Plan is not activated."

        "Accident Description": "The accident occurred while the DEA3 unit at the refinery was closed for maintenance works, between approximately 19:10 and 19:30 on 11 April 2011, presumably following inadequate H2S decontamination in the D3-T1 amine regenerator. Two workers from a contracting company were injured in the accident, one of whom later died in hospital. Both workers were thought to have been injured by the release of H2S from an open manhole in the D3-T1 tower. Both the injured parties were employed by a contracting company involved in the maintenance work on the tower. The work in progress involved opening the manhole in the D3-T1 tower to allow ventilation inside. The tower was emptied, depressurised and isolated by placing blanking plates on all connections. After opening the door of the tower's central manhole, the two workers came into contact with vapours inside the tower, which presumably contained H2S following inadequate decontamination of the tower. The accident presumably released a small amount of H2S gas into the atmosphere; it did not cause a fire or an explosion, and did not involve transport.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Inadequate H2S decontamination of the D3-T1 amine regenerator in the DEA3 unit, caused by failure to isolate the unit due to failure to insert the blanking plate at the battery limit on the acid feed into the sulphur plant.",
        "Consequences": "The incident harmed employees of a contracting company operating inside the plant. Specifically, one worker died and another worker temporarily lost consciousness.",
        "Emergency response": "The refinery's emergency team responded and administered first aid to the two injured workers. The workers were rescued alive and entrusted to the care of medical staff from the Italian national health service, who took them to the local hospital in Cagliari.

Disciplinary action: pursuant to Article 3 of Legislative Decree No 81/2008 (consolidated text on safety), the disciplinary procedure required under the regulations and referred to in the management and control model adopted by the company has been implemented. Disciplinary sanctions have therefore been applied to the operating and maintenance staff involved in the decontamination procedures, and to the plant managers and security staff, for actions that contravened the Operating Instructions and the plant's procedures (one person was dismissed and four were suspended)."

        "Accident Description": "An explosion took place in a building where double base propellant was produced.&nbsp; One propellant roll exploded when it was pressed through a matrix. There was one fatality.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A batch of six propellant rolls were brought into the thermostatic cabin of the pressing room.&nbsp; Four of these six rolls were pressed prior to&nbsp; the accident.&nbsp; The press had been functioning normally. The operator depressed&nbsp; the \"OK\" button for the fifth pressing. The green light was lit up on the control desk downstairs indicating that the press process could be started. Almost immediately after the start button had been pressed an explosion occurred. The estimated time of explosion and the nature of it&nbsp; are based on the information from the operators who were downstairs at the time of the accident. According to them&nbsp; an unidentified sound was heard from upstairs immediately following the start of the press. The explosion occurred immediately after this sound. The operator of the press being present&nbsp; in the pressing room when the explosion occurred, was killed. The three operators and the foreman downstairs ran out of the building. They were not injured.The operator who died had had more than 20 years of experience&nbsp; at the double base propellant process.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The investigation&nbsp; group could not identify with certainty the technical cause of the accident. However, the most likely course of events was judged to be the following: 1. After the start-up&nbsp; the hydraulic equipment commenced functioning normally, according to the control system. 2. Due to the failure of the gasket of the lifting cylinder, the heavy piston was able to move fairly freely3. The air pressure in the pressing cylinder increased to several bars causing a rise of the temperature higher than self ignition temperature of the propellant.&nbsp; Because of the fast lowering of the piston the&nbsp; suction pump&nbsp; was not able to develop a vacuum quickly enough.&nbsp; 4. As a result of the fast rising temperature in the pressing cylinder the propellant probably self-ignited. 5. After the pressure had reached high enough (to the range above 5 kbars) the burning of the propellant&nbsp; transformed into a detonation. 6. The piston lifted very quickly due to the high pressure of the explosion and then returned&nbsp; downwards again at a very high speed caused by the gas pressure. At this point the seal of the lifting cylinder was totally destroyed. The lower part of the lifting cylinder expanded. ",
        "Consequences": "The operator of the press was in the pressing room when explosion occurred and he was killed in the accident. The three operators and the foreman downstairs ran out of the building. They were not injured. The cylinder and the surrounding iron cast heating jacket were partly fragmented. The major part of the fragments were stopped by the structural walls and earth wall surrounding the building. A few bigger fragments flew over the surrounding earth wall up to 200 meters. These fragments caused no damage to persons or material. The outer walls of the pressing room (light construction) and the roof were destroyed. The supporting structures were damaged. The floor of the building was slightly cracked. The downstairs windows were broken and fell outside the building. None of the windows of the other buildings were damaged. The explosion caused a fire in the pressing room. The fire spread to the vegetation on the earth wall. Part of the exterior roof of the pressing room was destroyed in the fire, which was quickly extinguished. ",
        "Emergency response": "Fire brigade was alarmed and it managed to extinguish the remaining fire in a short time. Discussion about response: The company has started a three year program mainly based on the accident investigation. The aim is to further develop the safety system, safety culture and to make sure that the improvement suggestions of the accident investigation group will be carried out. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the&nbsp; accident the following preventive actions were established: - Horizontal press would eliminates the free fall of the piston- It must be ensured that no personnel are in the hazardous working areas.- Risk analysis systems should reveal hidden design errors.- The possibility of adiabatic pressing has to be eliminated. It is necessary to further develop the safety system and&nbsp; safety culture of the company. Measures to mitigate consequences: Design principles of the safety walls against fragments have to be checked."

The incident was reportable because more than 250 people offsite were confined for more than 2 hours to avoid exposure to combustion products.Unusual operation (melting tank contents and repressurising) carried out over 3 shifts. The supervisor on the day shift received the tank and attempted to connect it to the tank heating system over several hours. He failed to complete the work, leaving it to the the night shift. The night shift staff successfully completed this connection and applied heating. They next tried to connect the off-loading line through which a fresh nitrogen blanket was to be applied. This took time. They omitted to vent (depressurise) the tank as required during the period when the heating was applied, but were distracted by other problems. When going off shift, they left a verbal message to the day shift supervisor to vent the tank to depressurise it. This message was either not passed on, or ignored (accounts from the individuals conflict). The day shift supervisor did not vent the tank and tried to clear the blockage by inserting a heated metal rod in the discharge port to break the solid \"plug\" of sodium, resulting in the incident. He was aware of the risks and correct procedure but failed to follow it. No suggestion of wilful disregard for procedure, rather of human error.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Operator (shift supervisor) attempted to clear blocked valve by insertion of heated rod through valve port to heat solidified crust of sodium. The tank was pressurised with nitrogen and sodium erupted under pressure when blockage cleared. Unsafe method used by operator.An experienced, trained, supervisor found a blockage in the discharge valve and attempted to clear it by inserting a heated metal rod. This caused the release of internal pressure in the tank, ejecting molten sodium. The system was vulnerable to human error and communication across shifts failed in that a reminder to the supervisor to vent the tank was not recognised.Shortcomings were\nidentified in the management system with regard to:\nuse of standard operating procedures;\ncompetence of supervision;\ncommunication across shifts;\nvulnerability of the system to human error.\nHowever, the man who initiated the incident was competent to deal with\nthe situation and admitted that he omitted to carry out a critical step\ncontrary to written instructions.",

Number not known at this stage but more than 500 people for 2 hours.The incident was only deemed a major accident as more than 250 people were confined for more than 2 hours to avoid exposure to the cloud. The worst possible effects of the cloud would have been mild irritation of eyes and mucous membranes. The operators asserted that an off-site emergency was declared as a precautionary measure (agreed by the emergency services). This involved radio announcements and information given to the local authority and significant retail developments. They also claimed that despite the inconvenience, the public preferred to have been warned of the incident rather than have been left in ignorance with an obvious cloud approaching them. They stated that this attitude was confirmed at subsequent community liaison meetings. Some residents expressed concern to the Member of Parliament for the local constituency and these have been discussed with the Competent Authority (HSE), as a a result of which a local COMAH liaison committee has been established involving all relevant stakeholders including COMAH establishments, emergency services, local community and Competent Authorities.The off-loading building was destroyed but no other physical damage sustained to other parts of the establishment. Effects on the establishment were confined to disruption during the incident, when fire figting, subsequent loss of use of the destroyed plant, and management time taken in responding to the community and Competent Authorities. Off-site effects were short-term disruption in response to the major hazard alarm, confinement of members of the public for the duration of the incident, and short-term closure of a nearby motorway.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "On site emergency response team activated. Off site emergency services summoned. 11 fire appliances and 55 fire fighting personnel attended. Reduced to 2 fire appliances and 10 fire fighters overnight once incident was under control. Spillage contained and blanketed with salt to prevent escalation. Off site population warned by siren and local radio/television. Fire controlled and extinguished in approximately 3 hours. Emergency services remained on site until spillage made safe. Incident declared over after 6.5 hours. Fire Service retained an overnight presence  in case of re-ignition. The Competent Authority (HSE) staff oversaw a long and complex remediation to prevent recurrence and risk to on site personnel.Official action taken - other official action: The operator was required to prepare an action plan to address all matters of concern. Progress with implementing the plan is being closely monitored by the Competent Authority (HSE) inspectors.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: System of work for clearing blockages unsafe;\nthe ISO tank should have been vented to relieve pressure before work\ncommenced. Shift change procedures, particularly communication, need\nimprovement. On site and off site emergency response were both measured\nand effective.Measures to prevent recurrence: As well as addressing the organisational issues noted above, the operator has rebuilt the facility to a much higher standard. Physical controls will be installed to ensure correct sequence of operation and additional containment and mitigation measures will be installed. HSE is undertaking a local project assessing the adequacy of communications at shift handover at a number of COMAH establishments.Measures to mitigate consequences: The off site investigation revealed some confusion in the local community with regard to the type and meaning of alarms and sirens. This operator is located among a number of high hazard plants. All sites have been required to co-operate in developing a coordinated system of alarms and for ensuring effective information is given to the public in the event of an incident. As mentioned above, some residents expressed concerns to their Member of Parliament for the local constituency and these have been discussed with the Competent Authority (HSE), as a result of which a local COMAH liaison committee has been established involving all relevant stakeholders including COMAH establishments, emergency services, local community and Competent Authorities."

        "Finish Date": "2002-11-12 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Fire in an underground storage facility.This accident was notified because it is of technical interest.It was classified level 5 on the scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Comity of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive, the factor resulting in that level of classification being the number of third parties deprived of their means of employment.",
        "Causes of the accident": "At 4.15 a.m. on 10 September 2002, a fire was detected in the mine by miners on shift in adjoining shafts. As the walls are not airtight between the working shafts and the storage centre, the operatives were alerted by an abnormal smell. The fire was located in storage block n\u00b0 15 where 1,800 t of waste is stored: drums of soil polluted with arsenic, big-bags of household waste incineration bottom ash and industrial waste incineration bottom ash , big-bags of waste from asbestos removal work and big-bags of asbestos residues from a fire in a pesticide warehouse.The precise causes of the fire are not known. Several hypotheses have however been put forward, including: &nbsp;- The presence of waste that was still hot such as of household waste incineration bottom ash or industrial waste incineration bottom ash,&nbsp;- The presence of prohibited waste, especially flammable waste,&nbsp;- The presence of products incompatible with one another and/or that could develop incompatibility at mine temperature. So there is a presumption that waste classified as containing asbestos from a fire in a pesticide storage building, as this waste arrived packed in big-bags (the big-bags were not opened on arrival due to the asbestos hazard).",
        "Consequences": "The consequences of the accident are directly linked to the smoke produced by the fire. Significant concentrations of sulphur dioxide were measured discharging into the atmosphere, at the air return shafts. The installation of barrages enabled smoke emissions from the shafts to be rapidly reduced. Analyses of micro-pollutants, made on samples taken at several places and in particular in the environment (soil and plants), did not reveal any notable impact. The main values exceeding the standards allowed concerned two carcinogen pollutants, benzene and benzo(a)pyrene. Subsequent analyses for those 2 pollutants on smoke captured in block 15 seem to conclude that the emissions were of short duration. Significant quantities of dioxins and furans on the walls of tunnels close to block 15, at a depth of 600 m, but no contamination was found on the surface.No effects were found on the health of people living near the plant. At the time of the accident, the public were not asked to stay indoors but three nearby schools were closed, as a precaution. However several miners exposed to smoke at the time complained of skin problems and throat irritations. These assessments were confirmed by the panel of experts appointed by the local information and monitoring commission (CLIS) which concluded that there was no particular risk to local people, the public or surface staff and reported that several emergency service crew members showed clinical signs of slight intoxication with carbon monoxide, skin disorders and digestive problems that required medical attention.Initially, the fire caused work to be suspended at the storage centre and adjoining mine: thus 27 storage employees and 350 miners were laid off. Subsequently, it ultimately marked the permanent ending of operation of the centre. The future of the 40,000 t of waste stored down the mine has not yet been decided. Moreover, the ending of potash extraction, which should have been in April 2003, was brought forward by 6 months.",
        "Emergency response": "After trying in vain to extinguish the fire&nbsp; by spraying it with water (given the depth of the storage, not much water is available) and by using extinguishers, the fire-fighters set up barrages intended to extinguish the seat of the fire by reducing the flow of air in the block. At the Prefect's request, a team of fire-fighters from the neighbouring mine, specialised in operating underground, also fought the fire but without success.Any action where the fire occurred could only be by operatives using independent protection equipment bearing in mind, in addition, that the temperature at the bottom of the mine was of the order of 32\u00b0C (these constraints limit the length of each firefighting session to a maximum of 30 min and make necessary the presence of a standby response crew on the surface to act if needed).On 20 September, there was an inspection which concluded that the fire was out, without however prejudging the possible persistence of hot spots, subsequently confirmed by ongoing measurements made in the block by means of an automatic sampler. As the hot spots persisted, work to inject nitrogen designed to \"inert\" the atmosphere in the block and thus extinguish the last seats of combustion took place between 23 and 25 October.At later inspections, it was found that there were still some hot spots. On 7 November, further extinguishing was undertaken by injecting nitrogen to the heart of the few seats that were still active.On 12 November, the fire was considered to be totally out.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Various reports were produced by experts to determine the causes and circumstances of the fire:&nbsp;- Legal report,&nbsp;- Report requested by the Administrative Court,&nbsp;- Administrative report,&nbsp;- Report produced at the request of the CLIS which appointed a panel of experts,&nbsp;- Report produced at the request of the CHSCT.Their conclusions are not at present known, the CLIS experts having only agreed with the assumption \"of self-ignition subsequent to biological decomposition, chemical breakdown or a chemical reaction between products in particular pesticides.\""

        "Accident Description": "During a planned shutdown of a nitrobenzene production unit, a level indicator had to be removed from a pipeline for inspection. The pipe connects two process vessels that are under negative pressure in normal process conditions. The level indicator was installed in the gas phase of the pipe.\nIn the initial planning of the shutdown, the installation was to be emptied. The permit-to-work for the removal of the level indicator was made up based on the assumption that the gas line and the connected vessels would be empty but not flushed and cleaned. &nbsp;\nIt was the only maintenance work to be done on this gas line. &nbsp;Due to time pressure, the need to empty the gas line was reassessed. It was decided that the removal of the sensor could be done without emptying the line and connected vessels based on the facts that the sensor was mounted in the gas phase and the connected vessels under vacuum. The permit-to-work was not adapted to this new condition.\nThe level sensor was labelled the day preceding the work. However, the operator did not tag the level sensor but a temperature measuring device in a liquid line just beneath the gas line, also connecting the two process vessels. &nbsp;\nThe contractor removed all bolts of the flange without any sign of leakage due to the under pressure. When the flange connection was broken, air was sucked in, the content of the two vessels and the pipe line released and could not be stopped. In total about 12 tonnes of a mixture of nitrobenzene and dinitrobenzene was released to the work floor.&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "Line breaking on a wrong and not emptied pipeline connected to two process vessels, due to an error in labelling of the sensor that had to be removed for inspection.&nbsp;\nThe investigation showed that although required by the company\u2019s permit-to-work system that there was no control of the installation and safety measures before permit authorisation. Also, since the installation was to be empty but not flushed, the first line breaking was supposed to be supervised by an operator, but wasn't. These are two missed opportunities to detect the wrong labelling of the sensor.\nThe underlying cause was a to high workload on permits-to-work during shutdown.&nbsp; &nbsp;\nAnother underlying cause was that the prepared work permit was not changed after the descision not to empty the installation.",
        "Consequences": "In total about 12 tonnes of a mixture of nitrobenzene and dinitrobenzene was released to the work floor.&nbsp;\nThe spill was contained by the company&rsquo;s emergency team.&nbsp; No one was injured. The contractor was luckily fully protected (Hazmat suit and breathing protection). This full protection was in compliance with the company's requirement for a line breaking on an empty but not&nbsp;flushed and cleaned installation.&nbsp;",
        "Emergency response": "The spill was contained by the company\u2019s emergency intervention team. The spill was removed and the area cleaned up by a specialised company.&nbsp;",

        "Accident Description": "While gas was being withdrawn from the site, safe shutdown with venting was automatically triggered at 7:20 p.m. following a voltage drop on the 24VDC network powering the safety programmable logic controller (safety PLC) controlling the site\u2019s safe shutdown system. The triggering of this safety procedure caused the release of 25,000 m\u00b3 of natural gas, or 16 t of methane.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The operator identified two causes that triggered safe shutdown with venting.The first cause was the triggering of a relay in the LV (low-voltage) switchboard room. This cut off power to the LV switchboard room supplying power to the safety PLC for the cabinet controlling the site\u2019s safe shutdown system. The relay was triggered by a disturbing current from one of the supply circuits of the LV switchboard room.\nThe second cause identified was linked to malfunctioning of the backup power supply to the cabinet\u2019s safety PLC. The safety PLC has a backup system of chargers/inverters/batteries that should have enabled the teams on call to take action in good time to prevent the triggering of safe shutdown with venting. During the investigation conducted on the evening of the accident, the failure caused by a voltage drop affecting this safety PLC was placed on \u2018maintenance\u2019 status as a precautionary measure. This meant that any alarm would be relayed to the control room without triggering safe shutdown. It was also established that the battery system was working properly, with power supply to the safety PLC being maintained when power was cut. The batteries undergo regular maintenance and were in good condition.The failure of the backup power supply was caused by poor cabling in the relays of the charger in the cabinet. This cabling problem has been dealt with, so the backup function of the batteries is working properly again.",
        "Consequences": "The volume of natural gas released during this safe shutdown with venting was around 25.000 m&sup3;, representing 16 t of methane. Natural gas, which is primarily composed of methane (over 80%), is a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. The quantity of methane released during this event represented 7% of the site&rsquo;s methane emissions in 2021.",
        "Emergency response": "Following the failure, one of the preventive measures taken was to apply the lockout/tagout procedure to the LV switchboard room\u2019s two most energy-consuming supply circuits (air compressor and site staff facilities) until the investigation had been completed. The aim here was to minimise as far as possible the risk of a disturbing current triggering safe shutdown again.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The LV switchboard room and associated equipment have been under surveillance since the accident and are no longer locked out during working hours. The safe shutdown system has not been triggered again, while the analysis of the equipment carried out after the accident did not reveal any particular fault in the circuit-breakers or relay. This equipment will be replaced as an additional precautionary measure."

        "Accident Description": "The accident involved a 3000 m3 tank used for temporary storage of water drained from petrol and diesel tanks. This water, which contains traces of hydrocarbons, is normally sent to the treatment plant to have the hydrocarbon concentration reduced to the level at which it is permitted to discharge to waste water.According to the company management, the hydrocarbons normally lie at the top of the tank, with a maximum depth of about 10 cm. - which corresponds to a quantity of c. 20 m3. At the time of the accident, there was a depth of 3.4 m. of hydrocarbons, corresponding to a volume of 680 m3. For reasons which the company are still investigating, some hydrocarbon had been released from the tank, presumably from the vent on the floating roof. Apparently some of this material was then carried to the base of the tank by the internal drainage pipes. The tank does not have a retention cuvette.The vaporisation of the hydrocarbons led to the formation of some 60m. of vapour cloud, which extended to the nearby Provincial road Arquata Scrivia - Vignole B.According to witnesses, the cloud was ignited by the passage of two lorries. There was heard a first explosion, followed some seconds later by two more. Immediately after that fires were found on the roof of the tank and on the nearby transfer vessel.",
        "Causes of the accident": "In order to avoid icing of the tank, and to optimise subsequent water treatment, the tank is warmed internally to a temperature of 20-30\u00b0C by steam heat exchangers at the bottom of the tank.&nbsp; Preliminary investigations by the company suggest that steam may have leaked from the heat exchanger coils, thereby overheating the water, and hence also the hydrocarbons, which were therefore released through the vent hole.After further investigation:There would appear to have been an anomalous increase in temperature, perhaps caused by steam escaping from the heating system. However, at the time of writing this cannot be confirmed because the tank is still being emptied. Only once this is finished will it be possible to carry out a visual inspection of the roof and of the heating system.",
        "Consequences": "The installations involved were the drainage tank, which was affected\nby fire and explosion from outside, and, to a slighter extent, the\nnearby industrial water reception vessels. The two vehicles travelling\non the nearby road were damaged, as noted in short report, as well as\nthe service vehicle of the drainage tank operator which was parked near\nthe tank. The shock wave broke some windows in the porters' lodge 100\nmetres from the tank. In total, the vapour cloud affected an area of\nabout 60 metres from the tank towards the external road. There was no\npermanent damage outside the establishment.People - remarks:The drivers of the two lorries involved, which were proceeding in opposite directions on the Provincial road, were both injured, and taken to hospital. They were expected to heal in 7 and 15 days. As far as damage outside the plant is concerned, the two lorries were damaged, one in the cabin and the other on its canvas cover. Within the plant, there were damaged the tank concerned, and also a car used for internal movements.Ecological harm -&nbsp; remarks:The particulate material resulting from the combustion of the hydrocarbons was not dispersed into the atmosphere because of the meteorological conditions (snowing) and the amount involved. It was deposited immediately round the tank.Community Disruption - remarks:The provincial road was closed for about 1.5 hours, and, as a precaution, the inhabitants of some of the surrounding houses, as well as the staff of a nearby establishment (a materials depot), were evacuated for about an hour.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "The internal emergency plan was launched, with the activation of alarms, the shutdown of the plant, and the start-up of fixed cooling systems. The internal emergency squad was called out. At the same time the gatekeeper, as planned in the emergency procedure, called out the local Fire Brigade, ambulances, and police. After about 15 minutes, therefore,the external emergency plan was put into effect, involving primarily: the Fire Brigade, who took over the operations of fire extinguishing and containment; the police, who directed local traffic, blocked the Provincial road, and as a precaution also evacuated houses and offices immediately round the plant; and the ambulance service, called in to help those hurt.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Concerning points c) and d), for\nwhich the default \"no\" has deliberately been indicated, it should be\nnoted that the transposition of Directive 96/82/EC is recent, and for\nexisting establishments there are transitory arrangements up to 2001.\nIt will be possible to supply the specific response when the relevant\ninspections have been carried out. These inspections will be arranged\nonce the Ministry for the Environment, in accordance with Art. 18 of\nthe Directive and will look in particular at the state of\nimplementation of the safety management system intended to prevent\nmajor accidents.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Since investigations into the cause of the accident are still going on, no particular further safety measures have yet been taken. Considering, however, the results of the accident, there would appear in the first instance to be a need for better - perhaps automatic - control of the temperature within the tank, with provision for the steam supply to be interrupted if the temperature rises above the safety value. It would also be useful to have written procedures defining the operators' actions for the drainage sequence.Measures to mitigate consequences: Considering that the cloud expanded over the highway, and that this was probably the source of ignition, the company are considering whether the carry out such drainage operations on tanker further away from the roadside."

        "Accident Description": "On June 28, No 4 LP Holder was inflated to allow cup seal cleaning and, at the end of the operation, it was left partially inflated. On July 4, a recorded check was made on the holder. It included the check of the cup seals, too. The gas holder was deflated on July 9 to the top cup seal level to allow visual inspection of the cup below the water line. This inspection involved reduction of water in the seal by pumping water from the cup. The examination was completed and water pumped back into the seal to the original level. The holder was then inflated normally overnight to allow physical measurements in preparation for fitting low cup water alarms. Soon after full inflation, at approximately 7:00 am on July 10, the top seal failed and gas escaped. The holder rapidly lost height until the top cup seal entered the holder watertank. The gas cloud had dispersed without igniting. The last operator intervention was on the afternoon of July 9 and the seal failure occurred at approximately 6:55 am on July 10.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nDue to an operator error (the seal of a gas holder was not refilled correctly after an inspection), a large amount of natural gas was released into the atmosphere.

The atmospheric stability was assessed as Pasquill category \"D\".ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:At 15:30 the crankcase of an URACA horizontal action 3 throw pump, used to boost liquid ammonia pressure from 300 psi to 3,400 psi, was punctured by fragments of the failed pump-ram crankshaft. The two operators investigating the previously reported noises from the pump were engulfed in ammonia and immediately overcome by fumes. Once the pump crackcase was broken, nothing could be done to prevent the release of the contents of the surge drum (10 tonnes were released in the first three minutes). The supply of ammonia from the ring main could only be stopped by switching off the supply pump locally. No one were able to do this as the two gas-tight suits available were preferentially used for search and rescue operations, and thus release of ammonia continued.&nbsp; Ammonia fumes quickly began to enter the plant control room and the operators hardly had the time to sound the alarms and start the plant shut-down before they had to leave the building using 10 minutes escape breathing apparatus sets. During the search and rescue operation the fire authorities did not use the gas-tight suits and fumes entered the gaps around the face piece and caused injuries to 5 men. The ammonia cloud generated by the initial release drifted off-site and remained at a relatively low level.The supply of ammonia from the ring main could only be stopped by switching off the supply pump locally. No one were able to do this as the two gas-tight suits available were preferentially used for search and rescue operations, and thus release of ammonia continued. Ammonia fumes quickly began to enter the plant control room and the operators hardly had the time to sound the alarms and start shutting down the plant before they had to leave the building using 10-minutes escape breathing set. The on-site emergency plan was activated within minutes of the alarm being sounded; a roll call quickly established that only two men were missing. The two gas-tight suits were used to search and rescue rather than to isolate the ammonia ring supply. The isolation of the main ring was achieved 40 minutes after the start of the release: in this period of time 28 tonnes of ammonia (in addition to the 10 tonnes initially released) escaped to the atmosphere.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The catastrophic failure of an URACA liquid ammonia pump caused the release of pressurized liquid ammonia. The initial release of 10 tonnes in the first 3 minutes (the contents of the surge drum) was followed by 28 tonnes in the subsequent 40 minutes until the ammonia ring main was isolated.CAUSES:The crankshaft of the Uraca pump failed catastrophically smashing itself through the crankcase. Failure of the crankshaft was due to to the propagation of a fatigue crack through the web separating the first and second crank pins. Metallurgical investigations found no initiating defect leading to crack propagation. It is thought that the failure was due to some overload of the web/crank pin radius at some unknown time. No inspections were foreseen for this component.&nbsp; The pump design was not adequate (code 5308).",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:3,000 on-site people were exposed. 2 operators were immediately killed by the toxic release (they were investigating previously reported noises from the pump when the leak happened and they were surrounded by fumes). 5 members of the fire brigades were injured by ammonia because they did not use gas-tight suits and fumes entered the gaps around the face pieces of the suits.About 50,000 off-site people were exposed to the fumes (up to 7 km away) but nobody was seriously affected. Some mothers and children were affected by fumes while making their way home.MATERIAL LOSS:No significant material damages occurred except to the URACA pump.OUTSIDE THE ESTABLISHMENTThe ammonia cloud generated by the initial release drifted off-site and remained at a relatively low-level. On the basis of the described effects and of post accident predictions, it was evaluated that ammonia concentration was about 150 ppm for 10 minutes at 3.5 km reducing to 50 ppm for 15 minutes at 7 km from the leak source. On a map attached to the Original Report is shown the path made by the toxic cloud vs the time from the beginning of the accident.Local radio warnings were given but this was too late for some local schools. Some mothers and children were affected while making their way home (the accident occurred at about 15:30).Disruption of community life: The off-site emergency plan was activated within 5 minutes of the start of the release. Local radio warned off-site population.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The operators of the plant control room, before to leave the building using 10 minutes escape breathing apparatus sets because ammonia fumes began to enter the room, hardly had time to sound the alarms and to start the plant shut-down. The on-site emergency plan was activated within minutes of the alarm being sounded. A roll call quickly established that only 2 men were missing and a decision was made to use the 2 gas-tight suits for search and rescue in preference to isolate the ammonia ring main supply.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The off-site emergency plan was activated within 5 minutes of the start of the release. Local radio warnings were given but this was too late for some local schools and some mothers and children were affected while making their way home.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- existing similar pumps to be thoroughly examined and fitted with crankshaft deflection devices;\n2- older design crankshafts to be replaced with new crankshafts (differences in the material of construction and crank pin radius);\n3- critical plant machinery to be identified and subjected to a regime of inspection similar to that applied to pressure vessels.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, it was established that automatic remotely operated shut-off valves have to be fitted to liquid ammonia supply systems so that a hazardous piece of the plant can be isolated quickly and the amount of the ammonia (eventually released in case of an accident) reduced."

        "Accident Description": "Friday afternoon 10th August 2018 a plume (smoke) was seen coming from the pile of Vale SAS (industrial byproduct containing nickel sulphide). Ca. 4000 tonnes of Vale SAS where piled up in the warehouse. After taking contact with the owner of the product, the pile was cooled down with water. The advice given by the owner&nbsp;of the product was not to distribute the pile of powder over a larger area by the wheel loaders but to just cool it with large amounts of water. Friday evening a technician saw smoke coming from the pile again and again the advice was to cool the product with water. The technician monitored the situation during the advised period of time and when the situation was considered to be under control, the technician left the premises.\nThe owner of the product wrote down in the SDS that it was strictly forbidden to cool the product with water, but that it has to be distributed by a wheel loader. A few hours later the advice changed from distribution by a wheel loeader to extinguishing and cooling with large amounts of water. This cooling with large amounts of water was done by purpose of stopping the chemical reaction. There has never been a direct beam of water on the smouldering fire.\nSaturday morning 11th August 2018 at 10 a.m. a large amount of smoke was seen by another technician and by a contractor who were present because they had to start construction works. They were only present for this construction work since the company doesn't operate in the weekend. They immediately contacted the emergency services. The fire brigade came to the scene and in consultation with the owner of the product, the fire brigade decided to distribute the product by wheel loaders in a layer of limited hight over the surface. Saturday evening while still spreading the product a larger pocket of smouldering product was found. By excavating this smouldering product, the smouldering fire intensified which made it impossible to further work with theel loaders in the warehouse. The fire brigade desided not to follow the earlier advise not to use water any more and started to extinguish the smouldering fire with water, shortly after midnight.\nDue to the toxic (SO2) smoke from the fire, a wide area around the company was evacuated. Several neighbouring companies had to shut down due to this evacuation.\nThe fire brigade stayed on the premises till&nbsp;noon on 12th August . They have extinguished the fire with large amounts of fire water. The water in the warehouse and in the drain was sucked into vacuum trucks after the fire was extinguished and was brought to the owner of the product for treatment.\nA part of the dock was sealed by putting an oil containment boom in one corner. At the surface of the water were floating a number of yellow \u2018plugs\u2019, who were sucked and transported to the owner of the product for further analysis.\nThe contained water which was collected in the dirty water tank was treated by the company itself. The dirty water tank was filled for about 85% after the incident.\nBecause of the extent of the incident comprising 4000 ton environmentally dangerous product, this incident is to be considered a major accident according to the Seveso legislation.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The main causes of the accident are:\n- No information from the product owner to the operator about the risk on smauldering fire\n- Not sufficient follow up on the first smauldering fires.\n- Wrong information about the intervention method by the product owner. In practice the fire was only put out after using water. Spreading out of the product and covering with sand is also possible in theory, but impossible for large storage quantities like in this case.",
        "Consequences": "Some people in the neighbourhoud and some staff of emergency services have suffered breathing problems due to the smoke inhalation. The extinguishing water was contaminated and a large part of it flowed into the docks. Another part was collected in the sewer system of the company. The exact quantity which was released in the water in the docks is not known. It is known and it was seen&nbsp;that some yellow plugs were floating on the surface of the water after the ending of the incident. They were eventually removed by the personnel of the owner of the product.\nThe structure of the warehouse was weakened because of the high tempertures of the smouldering fire. But the strength of the building structure was evaluated as sufficent which admits a continued use of the warehouse for storing products. The concrete elements were not damaged and the steel structure was (lightly) corroded but is cleaned to prevent further corrosion from happening. The roof was repaired in two phases:\n\n- first a quick repair to guarantee the structural safety;\n- secondly a more torough repair withe the (partly) replacement of the metal beams&nbsp;and the roof cover.\n\nA juridical discussion between the client and ABT is in progress, but at the moment of the entering of the accident details in the system it is still not clear wath the result of this juridical discussion will be.",
        "Emergency response": "The fire brigade came on the scene and has taken the following actions/decicions:\n- the evacuation perimeter was set to 1,8 kilometers around the site\n- the fire was fought by distributing the pile of product by wheel loaders. When this action proved to be not effective, the smouldering fire was extinguished by throwing&nbsp;large amounts of water on the pile of product\n- part of the product mixed with the fire water was collected in the internal sewer system and the dirty water tank. This part of the spill was processed by the company itself in the internal waste water treatment\n- the firewater which flowed into the dock was dammed with an oil boom and (partly) removed from the water by a specialized company",
        "Lesson Learned": "Some measures and action values were adapted after the incident. More specific were following actions foreseen:\n- warning phase smouldering fire is induced when:\n\ntemperature smoke is higher than 30\u00b0C and the concentration of SO2 is higher than 1 ppm\nthe action according to this phase induces an announcement to the hierarchy of the company\nif necessary fire control is asked by the fire brigade&nbsp;\n\n- the fire brigade is contacted with the message of a smoulder fire when:\n\nthe concentration of SO2 exceeds 1,5 ppm OR the concentration of H2S exceeds 4 ppm AND there is smoke AND there is a higher temperature in the piles of product\nthere are flames and glimmer seen from the pile of product\n\n- the phase of smoulder is ended when the temperature of the pile of product is lower than 30 \u00b0C AND the concentration of H2S is lower than 4 ppm AND the concentration of SO2 is lower than 1,5 ppm AND there isn't any smoke anymore\n- the phase of smoulder is ended definitely when the temperatures and the gas values are below the threshold values for a period of more than 24 hours."

Five sections of the workshop all exploded and were aflame. In the explosion, about 1200t of chemical raw materials (methanol, acetic acid and vinyl acetate) were burnt or washed with firefighting water into the environment through the discharge outlet of the factory. The discharge outlet is about 1km from Longjiang River and about 30km from the river joint section (Yangmin section) on the border between Hechi city and Liuzhou city.",

        "Emergency response": "After the accident happened, the Company's organic plant production was immediately shut down to reduce the discharge of pollutants to Longjiang River. Local firefighters used a large amount of water to put out fires, but because the firefighting wastewater was too much, it caused a great threat to the water quality of the River. In order to avoid the secondary pollution caused by the firefighting wastewater, the emergency command center took the following measures in light of the actual situation: 1) pumped the wastewater directly into a newly built but not used wastewater treatment pool to be stored there temporarily; and 2) built four activated carbon dams using angle irons and wooden stakes as skeleton materials in the downstream of the sewage ditch. A total of 14.1t activated carbon was placed in the dams to adsorb pollutants in the wastewater. However, the emergency pool of the Company's organic plant did not work normally and no emergency levee was built, some chemical materials flowed along with firefighting wastewater into Longjiang River through the total discharge outlet of the plant. The emergency command center immediately asked the environmental emergency monitoring team to set up 5 fixed points and 1 mobile monitoring point at the total discharge outlet and the downstream sections of Longjiang River to monitor water quality and to track the head of the pollution belt in the river. They monitored the water quality once per hour. The environmental emergency monitoring team set up 3 atmospheric monitoring points in the downwind area from the accident site to monitor air quality. All these monitoring results provided strong support for the emergency command center to make decisions.\nAt 8:40 that morning, the emergency command center issued No.1 Notification to evacuate people within 5km from the accident site to ensure the life and safety of the Company's staff and nearby residents. At 11:10 am, it issued No.2 Notification to prohibit drinking any water taken from the downstream sections of Longjiang River below the accident site and notified various cage culture fishermen in Longjiang River to relocate their fish to safe watercourses. At the same time, it phoned to Liuzhou County's Environmental Protection Bureau to inform them of the accident situation to ensure the drinking water safety of people downstream. Because of timely notification, downstream residents of Figure Case-2-1 Scene of the incident site Annex 1 Eight Selected Chemical Accident Reports from China Longjiang River stopped fetching drinking water from the river; instead they got their drinking water from other water sources to solve the drinking water issue.\n",

        "Accident Description": "At a petrochemical complex, ethylene compressor 1 (ethylene is a highly flammable gas) was operating in a stable manner when, at 5.33 p.m., a sharp fall in pressure occurred together with a piercing noise. The gas detectors in the area became saturated and set off a second-level alarm in the unit\u2019s control room, in the control room for the adjacent compressor 2 and at the safety desk. The compressor began vibrating. Its motor shut down although its ethylene supply did not.\nConfusion as to which compressor was the origin of the leak:\nnot knowing which compressor the leak was coming from, the shift in charge of compressor 1 contacted the shift in charge of compressor 2. The latter convinced them that it was compressor 2 that was affected. Shift 1 therefore left its control room to come to their assistance. The alarms and readings showing that compressor 1 was malfunctioning (fall in pressure, etc.) were not taken into account as the control room was empty.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A valve was projected outwards due to incorrect tightening and a non-compliant seal.\nThe valve cover and light from the second floor of compressor 1 were discovered 6&nbsp;m away. One of the cover\u2019s threaded pins had broken in two (sudden brittle-type fracture), while the remaining five threaded pins were still in place, with three having had their nuts blown off and threading stripped. These threaded pins were compliant but had not been replaced since the compressor was put into service 16 years previously. An expert investigation showed that the valve\u2019s copper seal had not been annealed during assembly, contrary to procedure and unlike the other seals in the equipment. It was therefore not very flexible and had low capacity for absorbing strain. This fault, together with an error in tightening the threaded pin that was already approaching plastic deformation, caused the assembly to rattle and fracture.\nThe operator checked the other compressors, reviewed and replaced the threaded pins in the compressor for which the technology had changed (rolled threads instead of cut threads). It updated the maintenance plans for the compressors together with the sub-contractor. The threaded pins are to be replaced on every third servicing. The damaged compressor was put back into service after two months.",
        "Consequences": "The two shifts together with the in-house firefighters approached the accident area but were unable to enter due to the deafening noise. They found an inflammable ethylene cloud 4&nbsp;m high and 100&nbsp;m long, with visible droplets. 1.8 tonnes of ethylene (inflammable mass of 354&nbsp;kg) was released in 21 minutes.",
        "Emergency response": "The firefighters used water curtains to protect adjacent units. At around 5.45 p.m., shift leader 1 consulted the shift leader of the adjacent unit. They suspected a leak in the ethylene supply network. Two operators with noise protection equipment went into the cloud, protected by a water curtain, so as to reach the network\u2019s manual cut-off valves. They shut them manually, stopping the leak. The cloud quickly dispersed. The staff returned to the control room and shut the local valve feeding the compressor.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Information that would have made it possible to rapidly identify the equipment in which the leak originated was not taken advantage of because there was no-one in the control room and the information was not relayed to the mobile phones of the shift members who had gone to investigate or made their way to the other control rooms in the complex.\nIf the emergency shut-down had been activated, the leak would have been stopped earlier as such a shut-down cuts off both the motor and the ethylene supply. The staff thought it was enough that the motor had shut down as a safety measure when the vibration occurred. After the accident, the compressor was fitted with a system for emergency shut-down when gas is detected. However, manual emergency shut-down is still crucial in the event that the gas detection fails.\nDespite the risks of the cloud igniting (UVCE, flash fire), the internal emergency plan was not launched, staff were not evacuated and movements on the site were not restricted.&nbsp; The emergency services and nearby municipalities were not alerted. At the time, the head of the safety team deemed the situation to be under control because it was not windy and there were no sub\u2011contractor firms on site that day, a Saturday (no works, low vehicle traffic). The authorities were notified more than 24 hours later. The external alert procedures were reviewed."

Then the needle valve was opened from outside with a special wrench. Due to a defective valve, hydrogen chloride was released to the storage room for pressure tanks. The amount released was bigger that the capacity of the water column and the hydrogen chloride reached the atmosphere. The company fire brigade was immediately alerted and the local fire brigade a little later. They laid out C-tubes to put on a water curtain to avoid hydrogen chloride vapours dispersion.

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nDuring the start-up, an explosion occurred in the redistillation column of the ethylene oxide plant which came into operation in 1969 in a petrochemical industry. This plant had been shut-down in June from 1 to 23. When it was started up problems were experienced in stabilizing the column and a number of repairs were made to the pumps and instrumentation. On the day of the explosion, the column was sufficiently stable. When the explosion occurred all the employees were by chance in the control room. No alarm signals sounded during the last 30 minutes before the explosion occurred except the general alarm that sounded a few seconds before. Despite of the difficult internal communication caused by the destruction of the internal telephone and alarm systems and the emergency control centre, the operators started to shut-down the other plants of the factory and to fight the fire. The external emergency services and the authorities were informed on the accident and the emergency plan for the Antwerp harbour was activated. The emergency services arrived on site in 10 minutes and with the help of the factory's operators put out the fire and the release of chemicals within half an hour. 13 operators (two of them were of an external factory working for BP Chemicals) and a person outside the establishment (working in a neighbouring factory) were slightly hurt. The most serious injury was a broken arm. There were considerable damages inside the establishment: the redistillation column (32 metres high and 2.3 metres in diameter) was completely destroyed and pieces were found up to 700 metres away, some in a neighbouring factory. The ethylene oxide plant and other nearby plants were seriously damaged. Most of the buildings in a radius of 300 metres were damaged. The internal alarm and telephone systems were damaged and could not be used. The emergency control room was also unusable. Outside the establishment, window panes were broken in neighbouring factories and the nearby village of Zwijndrecht (about 1 km away). Nobody was hurt in the village.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nThe accident was caused by the decomposition of ethylene oxide at the base section of the redistillation column. There are two possible causes for this accident:\n1- a leak of ethylene oxide from a flange that had been insulated during shut-down. During the start-up, the released ethylene oxide reacted exothermically with the binders of the lagging and this caused a temperature increase that ignited the ethylene oxide;\n2. the development of a hot spot in a quiescent area of the column caused by the polymerization of ethylene oxide catalysed by rust deposits (this is less likely because no conclusive evidence of it was found).",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:\n13 operators (two of them were of an external factory working for BP\nChemicals) and a person outside the establishment (working in a\nneighbouring factory) were slightly hurt.

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nA fire started at the man-hole of an inspection pit for underground pipes of a petroleum storage depot during maintenance work on the piping supplying the tank No 2. The underground pipes were feeding eleven tanks in different conditions (empty but not degassified, half empty, full, empty and degassified, empty). Maintenance work started on June 11 (hot work-permit had been ordinarily issued on June 10 and the pipes were empty).  When the fire started, the water emulsion in the tank basins became yellow and ignited resulting in fire. The alarm was sounded and all valves were automatically closed (it required about 14 minutes). Soon after, the power supply was also interrupted. After inspection, all accessible valves were found to be closed and therefore rapid extinguishing of the fire was to be expected. Instead, the phenomenon repeated various times that afternoon and the flames were extinguished by the personnel quickly. There was an unsuccessful attempt to extinguish the fire by covering the inspection pit with sand. The fire escalated but the personnel in collaboration with the fire brigade managed to confine it within the tank dike by applying foam using foam monitors. At about 15:20 an explosion occurred and, even if all people thought it was tank No 76, the explosion was caused by two acetylene bottles used in the maintenance works. Finally, it was found that a valve of tank No 1 (full of gasoline) had been opened (for reasons not clarified) and it was releasing gasoline with a rate of 150 m3/h. The fire was extinguished at 15:40 (about 4.5 hours after it started). To extinguish the fire, about 43,000 litres of foam (from storage depot, local fire brigade, etc.), that is about 717 m3 of water, were used. The whole amount of water used in extinguish the fire and cooling the nearby tanks (about 1,500 m3) was collected and treated according to the degree of pollution established after the analysis for BOD5, COD and hydrocarbons. Monitoring of the underground channels revealed no pollution.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nThe most probable hypothesis is that, during the maintenance work, the man-hole of the inspection pit was put again in place but only one bolt was tightened. On June 14, the inlet valve of tank No 1 was opened for an unknown reason and the gasoline contained in the tank escaped with a flow of 150 m3/h. The flow could have lifted the cover of the man-hole allowing the release of gasoline.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 15 firemen were burned during the accident: 2 of them were badly hurt, 5 seriously and 8 slightly. The firemen were burned due to a gust of wind and for the cylinders' explosion. Outside the establishment two people (a photo reporter and a journalist) were injured but not for the effects of the fire or of the explosion. The photo reporter fell down by a roof and the journalist was injured by a fire fighting piping.MATERIAL LOSS:Damages of some fire fighting equipment of the fire brigade, destruction of the railways and of three wagons of the SNCF. As far as it concerns the depot:&nbsp; tank No 2 was deformed; tanks No 1 and 3 had traces of burning in the upper side; tank No 76 was damaged at the heat insulator; tanks No 76 and 78 had slight damages at the heat insulator; tank No 93 had traces of burning in the upper side and shows some point of impact due to the fragments of the acetylene cylinders (without perforation).The joints of the pipings placed on the left side were burned.ECOLOGICAL HARM:Soot and particulates were emitted for about 4 hours but no toxic gas emission occurred. Floating barriers have been precautionally employed but the fire water used was collected and treated according to the degree of pollution established after the analysis for BOD5, COD and hydrocarbons.

        "Start Date": "2002-11-28 00:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "2002-11-28 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The overpressure&nbsp; caused by an unforeseen runaway reaction between&nbsp; chlorinated tars and TDI caused the explosion of Tank no. D 528/2 and a subsequent fire. The pressure wave&nbsp; and the carbon dioxide formed by the explosion of the second tank no. D 528/1 extinguished most fires which had developed.The accident occurred in a section of high-boiling tars of the TDI department TD5. In the department TD5 toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) is produced through the reaction of 2,4-toluendiamine (TDA) and phosgene.The reaction is performed in 3 successive steps with increasing temperature from approximately 80\u00b0C to 170\u00b0C, with decreasing pressure and hydrogen chloride acid as a by-product.In the section of high-boiling tars, described in the attached block-diagram (ref. Attachment 2), a part of TDI is recovered in a vacuum batch process from the mixture containing 50% TDI and 50%&nbsp; high-boiling tars, stored in tank D 522, which is equipped with a stirrer and water refrigerated coils.The TDI is recovered by evaporation in the concentrator D 525/1, equipped with a stirrer, steam heated coils and maintained at vacuum pressure.Concentrator D 525/1 is fed by the tanks D 528/1-2-3 acting also as compensation tanks. The TDI vapours are then condensed and the liquid then transferred for storage, the residual gas is sent through a separator and then suctioned by the 3stage vacuum units P 509/1-3. The concentrate present in D 525/1 is composed of 18-20% TDI and for the remaining part of high-boiling tars is diluted with toluene, mixed and transferred over a pump in tank D 541, where it is continuously stirred at a temperature of 115 - 120\u00b0C with the objective of obtaining a sufficiently fluid and stable mass to be sent into the incinerator B 502/2 for combustion.On 26/11/2002 at about 17:40 the shift assistant of&nbsp; department TD 4-5 shut down the stirrer P 507 of tank D 522 due to the excessive noise of the reduction gear of the motor caused by an insufficient lubrication (memo in the logbook).Following the shutting down of the stirrer P 705 the temperature in tank D 544 started to rise gradually and stabilised at 125\u00b0C according to the value recorded by the DCS (Distributed Control System) switchboard assistant. These values cannot be considered&nbsp; reliable due to the fact that the instrument T 5-258 was calibrated to measure temperatures up to 120\u00b0C. Tank D 522 receiving the high-boiling tars and the TDI from the evaporator D 521 operates at a maximum temperature of approximately 95\u00b0C in normal operating conditions.On 27/11/2002 at 7:30 hrs the feed to tank D 522 is reduced from 400 kg/h to 1900 kg/h maintaining the water circulation in the cooling coils of tank D 522 constant. The reduction of the feed charge reduced the temperature in tank D 522 to 65\u00b0C. At approximately 12:00 hrs on 27/11/2002 the temperature of tank D 522 rose again in connection with the increased load of the evaporator D 521, which went up from the previous 1700 kg/h to 7000 kg/h. For the remaining part of 27/11/2002 and until approximately 17:30 hrs on 28/11/2002, when the stirrer was started again, the DCS registered a temperature beyond the top of the measurement scale (above 120\u00b0C). At 4:00 hrs on 28/11/2002 the shift personnel registered a temperature rise in tanks D528/1-2-3 and on the work sheet the temperature marked for tanks D 528/1-2-3 were respectively 136-142 and 131\u00b0C. The operating temperature normally foreseen for the tanks is 105\u00b0C.The switchboard operator reported to the shift assistant an abnormal batch distillation, characterised by the rapidity of the same and the low amount of distilled product, the temperature of D 525/1 was 139\u00b0C instead of 105-110\u00b0 expected at the beginning of the distillation.The operation manual did not indicate the measures to be adopted in case of high temperatures in D 522 and D 528/1-2-3.In the meantime, at 16:30 on 28/11/2002 tank 528/2 filled to 60% reached the temperature of 170\u00b0C.The design temperature of the equipment D528/1-2-3 is 150\u00b0C.At 18:00 hrs the temperature in tank D 528/2 reached 181\u00b0C and it was not possible to discharge tank D 528/2 because distillation was in progress in D25/1 and tank D541 feeding the incinerator B 502/2 was full and could not receive the high-boiling tars from D 525/1.Only at 18:35, when the distillation process in D 525/1 finished, could the discharge into D 541 be performed, only at this point did D 541 have the capacity to receive the content of D 525/1.At 18:50 valve XV 5316 was opened to start the discharge operation of tank 528/2 into tank D 525/1; in that point tank D 528/2, with a nominal capacity of 10m3, was 59.5% full and the temperature&nbsp; 220.7\u00b0C. The attempt to discharge tank D 528/2 did not succeed, due to the fact that the not homogenous product inside the tank contained solid matter which blocked the discharge of the tank. Inside the tank unwanted chemical reactions had been going on for hours with development of gas and increase of the temperature and viscosity of the reaction mass.Four external contractors approached the distillation unit D 525/1 to verify the conditions inside the unit through a visual inspection window installed on the dome cap. A dense white smoke inside the distillation unit did not allow the workers to look inside the equipment and the pipe connecting tank D 528/2 to the rupture disk was particularly hot. At 19:25 a second attempt to discharge the tank was made but failed, the temperature on the control panel indicated 220\u00b0C while there was no means to measure the pressure inside the vessel. At 19:30 the four external contractors were still in the plant verifying the hydraulic guard D 583 when a strong whistling was heard and white smoke leaking from the flanged coupling located on the delivery tube of the distillation unit D 525/1 was seen. Instinctively the four external contractors tried to escape but a strong explosion was heard, at 19:42 hrs tank D 528/2 exploded. The tank contained a mixture of TDI and TDI high-boiling tars. The pressure wave of the explosion made one escaping worker fall while all were hit and covered by a dense, warm, half solid substance with a high viscosity and a granular structure. After a few (dozen) seconds a fire developed.The explosion ignited a fire involving the terminal part (southern side) of the framework of the \"TDI high-boiling tars processing\" department. The fire was mainly fed by 20 tons of diathermic oil (Aerthem 320) and one ton of toluene due to the rupture of the corresponding pipes.The fire affected the second of the three TDI and high-boiling tars storage tanks, D 528/1 (85% full when the accident occurred), causing its mechanical failure and releasing the second explosion at approximately 20:25 hrs. The explosion of tank D 528/1 extinguished the main fire leaving only some residual secondary fires.",
        "Causes of the accident": "According to the information given by the operator and from the analysis of the plant data on the section involved in the accident, it is assumed that the accident was caused by an unwanted thermally activated condensation reaction between the high-boiling tars and TDI first in tank no. D522, which then developed in tank D 528/2 with the release of heat and carbon dioxide causing the mechanical explosion of tank D 528/1 due to overpressure.The principal causes assumed are the following:Interruption of the stirring movement in tank D 522Missing operative instructions concerning the management of abnormal conditions caused by high temperature in tanks D 522 and D 528 1/2/3Missing information on the risks involved in managing the abnormal process conditions relating to the specific caseMissing pressure measurement instruments in tanks D 528 1/2/3According to the information given by the operator and from the analysis of the plant data on the section involved in the accident, it is assumed that the accident was caused by an unwanted thermally activated condensation reaction between the high-boiling tars and TDI, activated first in tank no. D522 and then developed in tank D 528/2, with the release of heat and carbon dioxide causing the mechanical explosion of tank D 528/1 due to overpressure.The high temperatures and the prolonged residence time of the mass in D 528/2 (approximately 13 hours), supported the development of exothermic condensation reactions or reactions associated with the formation of carbon dioxide and a significant pressure increase.When the explosion occurred the internal temperature of tank D 528/2 was above 220\u00b0C and clearly the tank was in extreme overpressure conditions. When the event occurred the tank was filled to 60% of its design capacity of 10 m3.A study has been performed by the Dow, on the thermal stability of the substances involved in the accident and in particular on the results of the adiabatic calorimetric tests (ARC) performed on a tar sample collected immediately after the accident from tank D 522, with the goal of understanding the behaviour of the substances involved in the accident.The tests were made by heating a known quantity of material composed by high-boiling tars and TDI in an adiabatic thermal system and registering the temperature and pressure evolution over time. This test simulated the heating process of the product in D 528/2 involved in the explosion. The test results agree basically with the values registered by the DCS during the accident and demonstrated the development of two distinct reactions, one exothermic reaction and another one developing carbon dioxide.The rupture disk failed due to a plug formed of hardened foam of the \"boiling\" mass on the pipe connecting the tank with the rupture disk and the venting manifold.",
        "Consequences": "ON-SITEThe event caused injuries to 4 workers and the partial destruction of the department.OFF-SITETests performed by the Water Magistracy of Venice on water samples taken from the lagoon in front of the TDI plant showed that polluting substances released by sewage drain SM15/3 were discharged in the lagoon through the general sewage drain SM15 of the installation, spreading in the aquatic environment modifying the chemical characteristics of the water in the lagoon up to 1 km from the establishment.People - Remarks:Personnel present on-site- When the event occurred there were 30 Dow employees and 6 external technicians for activities on the TD12 plant. Of these only 4 external contractors needed medical treatment as specified below.Composition of the emergency response teams: - The EniChem fire brigade intervened with a team of 12 persons;- The national fire brigade intervened with a team of 52 persons.Persons involved off-site.- The population was not involved in the accidental event.- The distance from the urban quarter C# Emiliani (population of 10,000 inhabitants) of Porto Marghera is&nbsp; approximately 2500 m.- The distance from the village of Malcontenta (population of 1,000 inhabitants) is&nbsp; approximately 1,1250mImmediate or subsequent fatalities: No fatalities were registeredHospitalised injuries: Nobody was hospitalisedInjuries not requiring hospitalisationThe 4 external workers who were performing controls in proximity of the plant equipment were involved in the accident but were only partially exposed to the effects of the explosion of tank D 528/2. All received first medical treatment at the infirmary of the petrochemical establishment and then at the emergency department of the hospital Umberto I in Mestre.The medical reports of the emergency department contain following diagnosis:Worker No. 1: 3 days of incapacity to work(from 28/11/02 to 02/12/02), due to pharyngeal hyperaemia and facial erythema.Worker No. 2: 31 days of incapacity to work(from 28/11/02 to 30/12/02), due to I and II degree burns on the scalp.Worker No. 3: 31 days of&nbsp; incapacity to work(from 28/11/02 to 30/12/02), due to the consequences of exposure to toxic industrial substances.Worker No. 4: 53 days of incapacity to work (from 28/11/02 to 21/01/03), due to the after effects of a trauma caused by a contusion associated with a distortion of the right knee and state of reactive anxiety.Hospitalised persons: There were no hospitalised injuries&nbsp; (the Italian says non-hospitalised injuries)Persons put under health monitoring programs: There have been no persons put under health monitoring programs consequent to the accidental vent occurred.Ecological Harm - Remarks:Consequent to the accident that occurred on 28/11/02 the personnel of the Antipollution department of the Water Magistracy of Venice (SAMA) performed a series of controls on the drains of the site. Considering the position in which the accident occurred, it was considered appropriate to concentrate on the community sewage drain SM15. During the days following the accident controls were made not only on sewage drain SM15 but also on the section drain SM15/3 directly connected to the TDI production department and on the drain SM15/22 of the central biological sewage treatment plant of the installation, which might have suffered consequences from the event.Both drains form the general drain SM15. Moreover, on 04/12/2002 all drains of the installation were controlled. The timing of the controls and detailed data of the samples are annexed. It has to be stated that the sampling method adopted was of instantaneous type and that all sampling operations and analysis were performed in compliance with regulations and in presence of the party.Moreover it has to be stated that the analysis of TDI (toluene di-isocyante) and aromatic amines&nbsp; showed the presence of TDI with concentrations corresponding to 5280 mg/l and traces of aromatic amines (0.2 mg/l of aniline, 0,1 mg/l of p-toluidine). The concentration values of dichlorobenzenes&nbsp; (chlorinated solvents not mentioned elsewhere) and of organic aromatic solvents (toluene)- all compounds used in the production process involved in the accident - were also particularly high.During the inspection on 29/11/2002 two successive sampling operations were performed on the terminal gully of drain SM15/3 with the goal of verifying the characteristics of the effluents discharged in two distinct periods. This procedure was adopted following the observation during the inspection that the characteristics of the effluents varied strongly.Annex 2 of the present report (annex no 2) lists the values of the samples taken during several inspections made on drain SM15/3 resulting above the threshold values defined by D.P.R. 962/73 and D.M. 30.7.1999. Drain SM 15/3 discharges into the main sewage channel conventionally called SM15, which discharges into the lagoon via the Malamocco-Marghera Channel. It has to be mentioned that the sewage discharged by drain SM15/3 is not subject to any additional treatment downstream of the terminal gully from which the samples were taken. Only in one sample, corresponding to record no. 2663 taken on 29/11/2002, were traces of TDI&nbsp; found (15 mg/l), while in the samples taken afterwards the concentrations of the compound were below the sensitivity of the test method adopted.In conclusion it is considered that consequent to the accident that occurred on 28/11/2002 at the establishment Dow Poliuretani Italia Srl drain SM 15/3 caused a temporary but consistent pollution of the lagoon water. The polluting substances were channelled into the lagoon via the general drain SM15 of the establishment, spreading in the aquatic environment and modifying the chemical characteristics of the water in the lagoon up to 1 km from the establishment. #omisis#The characteristics of the fire and the atmospheric conditions characterised by very slight wind and stability probably favoured an umbrella like fallout pattern of the pollutants around the establishment, which resulted quite uniform, with peak concentrations in the SW sector in the direction of the monitoring stations of&nbsp; via Bottenigo and of Malcontenta and with slightly lower concentrations in the opposite sector in the direction of the city of Mestre.The TDI fire and of the other substances present in the installation caused an increase of the substances typical for combustion processes (nitrogen oxides, carbon oxide and hydrocarbons in a minor proportion), even if the absolute values measured are comparable with the values measured during traffic peak hours in stable meteorological conditions.The increase of toluene is much more significant and to a minor extent the increase of Ethyl-benzene and Xylenes; the absolute values were higher, although not much higher, than the values measured at peak hours of days with high traffic rates.It is interesting to note how the concentration ratio toluene/benzene increased by a factor&nbsp; between 7 and 8 with respect to normal traffic conditions, which may indicate the presence of toluene originating from the accidental event.Moreover the values measured for styrene, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, trimethylbenzene do not differ much from the values indicated in literature for highly urbanised and industrialised areas.It is important to note the absence of dichlorobenzenes in all air samples of the urban areas, even the ones taken in the most critical fallout phase, whereas dichlorobenzenes were found in significant concentrations in proximity of the accident place even the morning after the fire.The concentration of hydrogen chloride measured on the over-bridge in Mestre, in the peak fallout time (between 22:00 and 23:00) is also worthy of note; it could no longer be&nbsp; detected the next morning.The concentrations of dioxins, furans, and PCBs similar to dioxins, measured by CO.INCA (Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale Chimica per l\u00edAmbiente \u00f1 Interuniversitary Consortium foe Environmental Chemistry) on the total particulate were undoubtedly low, the total values were comparable with the background concentration levels indicated by literature for urban areas.At time of the present report, the research for organic micro-pollutants on the atmospheric particulate and on ash-sludge in the fire zone, was still in progress.",
        "Emergency response": "ON SITEConsequent to the explosion and the subsequent fire, in the control room the assistant on duty in department TD1-3 released the general alarm and activated the emergency shut down procedure for securing the plant, while the assistant on duty in plant TD 4-5 put on the self-contained breathing apparatus and performed a series of operations for securing the plant.AT 19:47 hrs the national fire brigade was alerted over the telephone;At 19:49 hrs the preliminary alarm was released in the department; At 19:52 the general alarm was released in the whole installation;In the standard on-site emergency response procedure of the establishment a distinction is made between two failure situations:state of alarm: a situation in which the unfavourable evolution of an emergency in a department appears to be likely.state of emergency: a situation in which the unfavourable evolution of an emergency in a department has the potential to involve entire areas of the establishmentFrom 19:59 hrs to 20:06 hrs the procedure of communicating the event&nbsp; via fax to the public authorities was activated.The extinguishing operations were performed by the fire brigade of EniChem employing extinguishing foam, while the fire brigade of Venice carried out the cooling of the adjoining plants and equipment with water hydrants, the containment of the gas emissions with water curtains and the monitoring of temperatures with infrared-cameras.At 20:45 the fire could be considered as extinguished.AT 22:45 the on-site emergency was called off.OFF SITEAt 20:30 hrs the acoustic alarm for the population was activated&nbsp; over the acoustic system located in Marghera.At 21:30 the off-site emergency was called off.Emergency Measures - Remarks:At 19:47 following the signalling of the emergency by the workers of the Dow plant the shift technician of EniChem in charge of emergency signalling alerted the works fire brigade and then the national fire brigade.All equipment was secured and the fire put under control by approximately 20:30 hrs, thanks to the rapid response of the works fire brigade located inside the chemical pole at a distance of 700-800 meters from the accident place, associated with the intervention of the national fire brigade of Venice and the rapid response of the plant personnel releasing the emergency shut down of the plant over the automatic shut down systems. The members of the fire brigade of Venice equipped with an infrared-camera monitored the temperature of the structures and of the equipment during the fire and at the same time provided the cooling of the structures and equipment affected by the fire.Official action taken - legal action: A penal action was started against some mangers of the TDI plant. Some minor civil actions for biological damage were also started.Official action taken - other official action: SPISAL (Service for the Prevention, the Hygiene and the Safety in the Working Environment) applied sanctions against three managers according to D.Lgs. 626/94 e D. Lgs.758/94. The Ministry for the Environment  requested the conclusion of the assessment of the SMS foreseen by article 25 of D.Lgs. 334/99 and the judicial investigation according to art. 21 of D.Lgs. 334/99\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Risk analysisFollowing the accidental event of November 2002 a thorough safety assessment of the plant starting from the cause analysis has been further developed using different up to date methodologies.The studies and analysis listed below, applied to the high-boiling tars section and to the entire TDI production process, followed by the implementation of technical and procedural changes, demonstrate the high safety standard reached and maintained and in particular with regards to process control, management of failures and accident prevention.The characteristics of the high-boiling tars processing section of department TD5, and particularly concerning the chemical behaviour of the products processed, correlated with the parameter of residence time, temperature and composition, lead to the accident dynamics of November 2002 being considered anomalous, due to the fact that it could not have happened in any other section of the department or in any other phase of the processing cycle. LPP (Loss Prevention Programme) Guidelines for the analysis of the compliance of the process with the accident prevention principles.This methodology was developed by the technological centre of the company based on the experience gained in the establishments of Dow and other major companies operating worldwide.The compliance with these guidelines allows the performance in terms of safety and operating reliability in general to be improved.These guidelines often reflect the entire experience and knowledge gained on the management of process plants and the process anomalies that may occur in any of the activities involved in the management of a chemical plant (design, process control, operation, safety procedures, equipment).Analysis of the management systems of the combustion plants.As for the foregoing guidelines this tool is used inside the company to compare the combustion systems (heating furnaces, steam generators) with the most advanced technologies in the field of safety and reliability.During the audit the problems concerning the management of the furnaces, the safety systems (alarms, shut-down systems), the control systems and the process parameters were analysed, using the most advanced international standards as reference and complying with Italian and European norms.- Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA)The LOPA analysis is a simplified form of risk analysis that analyses the risk of an undesired event over the magnitude of the event frequencies, effect gravity and event probability.The LOPA process builds a risk analysis process using all data available from the Dow technological centre, from the databases of the company, from the plant histories and using the specific knowledge of the process engineers of the plants (from Dow or other companies).The analysis demonstrates that the implemented safety systems are adequate to obtain acceptable risk levels.- Investigation into the problems concerning chemical reactivityAll aspects concerning chemical reactivity of the substances present in the TDI production cycle were examined very closely; product incompatibilities and eventual instabilities were analysed.Chemical reactivity matrices and reference guidelines, based on Dow's experience, have been issued for the personnel of all Dow installations and in particular for those producing isocyanates.A detailed analysis was&nbsp; performed on the reactivity of TDI and high-boiling tar mixtures with respect to different parameters, such as temperature, residence time and composition, referring also to the accident that occurred in November 2002.Paragraph 2.4 lists the studies carried out, these studies have been used to increase the safety of various sections.-Definition of Process Safety Cardinal RulesDevelopment and implementation of the cardinal rules concerning the process safety during production of dinitrotoluene, toluene di-amine, toluene di-isocyanate and phosgene.These rules have been developed based on the experience of Dow and other leading companies gained in plant management; the rules indicate in a clear and concise way the criticality of different process phases, pointing out the operations to be avoided, with the goal of operating at the highest safety levels.- Pre start-up Audit As foreseen by the procedures of the company an audit was performed on the plant to check if there were the necessary safety conditions to restart the plant following the recent shut-down for maintenance.The audit was carried out on the entire plant with particular attention on the high-boiling tars processing section upstream the introduction of chemical reagents in the process; the&nbsp; performance of all foreseen test procedures on equipment and piping subject to maintenance was audited, and adequate training of the operative plant personnel was verified with specific checklists.The implementation of the procedures contained in the operative manual was verified with a particular focus on the safety standards.- Updating of the operative manualThe entire operative manual of the department was revised, not only with regards to the high-boiling tars treatment section, which was the main reason of the revision, but also for all departments of the plant.- Management of change (MoC)All technical or procedural changes have to be assessed through a MoC procedure analysing the consequences of the change with specific checklists with the participation of all roles involved.When the present report was issued, it was foreseen that by the time&nbsp; modifications were operative&nbsp; the operating procedures for the modified plant would also be available and the training of the personnel would have been concluded"

        "Accident Description": "SAFETY SYSTEMS OR OPERATORS INTERVENTION:Operator in control room activated emergency procedures including fire alarm and emergency shut-down ot the plant.OTHER SYSTEMS INVOLVED AND OPERATING CONDITIONS:Damages to pipes on adjacent pipe-rack resulting in the release of methane and of a small amount of ammonia vapours.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A 24\" pipe carrying synthesis gas (Hydrogen = 43.5%, Nitrogen = 14.08%, Methane = 0.2%, Carbon Dioxide = 12.3%, Water = 29.3% by volume) ruptured. About 60 kg of hydrogen contained in the gas initially released formed an unconfined vapour cloud and exploded. The explosion was audible up to 2.5 km from the factory and it caused considerable alarm to the residents. Lengths of pipe on either sides of the rupture were displaced as a result of the depressurization. An 8 m length pipe downstream rotated upon itself of about 380\u00b0 while a 12 m length pipe upstream rotated of about 90\u00b0. This 12 m section damaged the pipes on an adjacent pipe-rack rupturing the vent header from the desulphurizer unit and causing the release of approximately 600 kg of methane. The hydrogen released from the upstream section of the 24\" pipe subsequently burned as a jet-fire about 70 m long. The released methane initially burned as a cloud (60 m long) and then as a jet-fire from the ruptured vent header. On hearing the explosion and by the indications from the plant instrumentation of a major leak, the plant operator shut-off the supply of natural gas to the plant and shut-down the individual units. After about 5 minutes the fire extinguished. A small amount of ammonia vapours which had been released from a fitting on a vapour return line (damaged by the 12 m section pipe) dispersed harmlessly.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATIMG EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The rupture of a 24\" pipe resulted in the release and ignition of a hydrogen vapour cloud. The ruptured pipe caused further damages resulting in release and ignition of methane and in the release of a small amount of ammonia that dispersed harmlessly.CAUSES:Metallurgical examination of the 24\" pipe showed that a fatigue failure occurred, induced by thermal cycling. Examination of the fracture faces of the ruptured seam weld showed a significant amount of fatigue cracking initiating at the bore of the pipe along a length of about 3 metres of the weld downstream the water injection point. At the upstream end, the rupture propagated circumferentially around the pipe as a shear failure. At the other end, the rupture arrested at a circumferential weld and then propagated as a circumferential tear in the pipe material. The spray pattern from the nozzle was such that water at 80\u00b0C was intermittently hitting the inner surface of the pipe and quickly cooling the surface. The process gas stream at a temperature of 230\u00b0C quickly heated up the pipe wall again only for it to be quickly cooled by water impingement at the start of the next cycle. This phenomenon which affected a number of areas in the pipe wall downstream of the water injection nozzle caused a number of small fatigue cracks which ultimately developed so that the material near the longitudinal weld failed. Subsequent examination of the spray nozzle showed that this may have been distorted for some time prior to the accident causing preferential impingement possibly enhancing the failure mechanism although it is not concluded that this distortion was the main cause of the failure. There was a two year history of previous leaks in welds further downstream on this section of pipe which it is now recognized were due to the same cause. At the time the company wrongly diagnosed the cause as external stress corrosion cracking.The accident occurred due to the rupture of a 24\" pipe (code 5102) caused by a cyclic fatigue corrosion (code 5104). The cyclic fatigue corrosion was induced by thermal cycling. The underlying causes that led to the corrosion of the pipe were: a plant design inadequate (code 5308), insufficient maintenance procedures (code 5313) and an inadequate management attitude problem (5302) because it failed to clarify the causes of previous accidents.",
        "Consequences": "MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion damaged the pipes on an adjacent pipe-rack and a heat exchanger. It also caused the glasses breakage and superficial damages to the buildings. Outside the establishment the explosion caused the breakage of a small amount of windows and damaged the roof tiles on one house. The cost of the damage has been estimated at about 0.65 M Euros.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The effects of the explosion are shown on a map attached to the Original Report. There were no off-site significant overpressure. At the nearest residence at a distance of 200 metres a small amount of glass breakage occurred (the overpressure was estimated to be about 2 kPa) but, in any case, the explosion was audible up to 2.5 km from the\nfactory and it caused considerable alarm to the local residents. 193 people lived within a 0.5 km radius from the plant.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire alarm was activated and the Company's on-site emergency procedures were put into operation. The supply of natural gas to the plant was cut off and the plant shut-down sequentially. Subsequently, the whole ammonia plant was depressurized and routine decommissioning procedures were activated. After about 5 minutes, the fires became extinguished due to the exhaustion of available combustible gases.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The external emergency services were not called by the Company but they were activated by an alarmed resident in the area. The accident was over before the off-site services arrived on the scene.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: The plant had to be modified so that the water injection system will be replaced by a reboiler system. This will eliminate the probable cause of the pipeline rupture (i.e. the presence of water droplets within a much hotter gas stream in the pipe). Parts of the plant where a similar phenomenon was possible (high-pressure steam desuperheaters used during start-up only) were examined, but no were detected. When the Original Report was prepared, the company was undertaken an assessment of its preventative maintenance procedures and expertise."

The employees planned to remedy the fault mechanically through manual intervention. For this activity, a risk assessment was carried out beforehand. Based on this, a written work permit (special release certificate) was issued.The intervention to clear the blockage took place at the maintenance hatch in the drop chute / entrance to the screw conveyor underneath the B\u00fcchner funnel\u2019s exit gate.Despite the safety measures taken (e.g. use of a wooden rod to avoid sparks), this resulted in an unanticipated (most likely electrostatic) ignition of the SBP spirit fumes being released from the product.Safety function:Automatic fire alarm / foam sprinkler system in the production building, fire alarm alerted, on-site fire service, water reserve system for extinguishing the fire, medical service, pressure release via a rupture disc (400&nbsp;mbar).",

Nevertheless, the accident, which caused major material damage and a considerable stir in public opinion, was found to be interesting with regard to the aspect of emergency management. For a long time there were concerns about possible air pollution.The event is classified as level 5 of the gravity scale (the number of persons who had to be confined during the emergency response operations, about 30,000&nbsp; relates to level 5, while the cost of material damage relates to level 4)Therefore, the accident is not relevant for the MARS database, and because of this reason it is notified in the context of the OCDE database (other events) However, it would fulfill the criteria of Annex VI, if the latter was applicable. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "The fire was probably started by an electrostatic discharge during the solvent transfer. The pallet truck was not earthed, and the worker's shoes were not anti-static. Therefore, earth contact was not assured. The worker's initial panic and the very fast development of the fire made any response action by the employees impossible; the employees left the workshop within a few minutes.\n\n",
        "Consequences": "The effects on the environment were minor: The analysis of the smoke within 100 m of the fire showed that very close to the fire the hydrochloric acid concentration was 4 ppm, while the benzene concentration was 100 ppm. The health inspection did not detect any case of intoxication. As there was no capacity for retention, part of the water used for fire fighting (1800 m3) flowed off into the sewage network, without compromising the functioning of the sewage treatment plant, which was warned in good time. The results of ground and water analysis did not reveal any significant pollution.\n\nThe material damage, of about 10.67 Million Euros (10.570.000 euros), was major: plastics (mainly PVC), solvents (toluene and xylene) and the finished products (packaged polyurethane mastics and glues) constitute the principal part of the materials involved in the fire. The MDI storage and the drums in the processing area were protected by the fire-walls and thus were not affected by the fire.",
        "Emergency response": "The emergency services react quickly. A large plume of black smoke develops and partially touches the nearby urbanised zone. Since the meteorological situation was not favourable for the rising and the dispersion of the plume, the emergency services ask the population to remain inside the buildings. The event is abundantly covered by the media because of the broadcasting of the directions for confinement by the local radios. Three schools located in the direction of the plume are evacuated. The fire is under control after 2h 30 min. The confinement measures are suspended around 13:30, since the fire has been extinguished. The emergency services keep monitoring the situation during the whole of the following day.After the fire was extinguished, a number of measures were taken to ensure a follow-up:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Protective Measures:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Inspection of all installations and&nbsp; assessment of the operational conditions of the site (administrative and regulatory situation),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Prefect's decree prohibiting the resumption of activities and prescribing clean-up - waste storage -&nbsp; and waste removal - measures to be carried out,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Health-related measures:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Consultation of 360 doctors on the health-related consequences of exposure to the smoke,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Environmental measures:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A monitoring campaign of the ground and of vegetation in the area affected by the accident,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Monitoring analysis of the extinguishing water originating from the fire fighting, of the sewage water and of the water in the sewage treatment plant.The following results were obtained:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * With respect to health and the environment, the impact was minor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * At the time of the accident, the company was operating the plant in a way that anticipated the authorisations that had been applied for. (specifically, increase of the quantities of stored MDI)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The inspection of the installations has highlighted the absence of a system for the retention of extinguishing water, as well as an inadequate delivery rate of fire-fighting water, the fact that waste was stored without any containment system and exposed to the atmosphere, and the fact that an incomplete file had been submitted when applying for authorisation.",
        "Lesson Learned": "With regard to technical aspects:The fire-walls and the emergency services response operation allowed the accident to be kept adequately under control, but the fire-wall's efficacy was compromised by the presence of the sky-dome too close to it. It is important to consider the risk of ignition of elements that can melt when heated and which can compromise the efficacy of protection devices such as fire-walls.AdministrationThe applications for authorisation of installations already in use must be the object of formal notices, according to Article L514-2 of the environmental Law.In hazard studies, it is imperative to describe the substances that may be formed by decomposition during a fire, and to evaluate the consequences, in order to adjust the prevention, protection and response measures.Crisis management:The event had an extensive media coverage through the broadcasting by the local radios of the confinement instructions,&nbsp; information which was picked up by the national radios. A large number of press organisations immediately sent reporting teams to the site; they arrived before any overview of the situation could be obtained and even before any real operational command post could be set up. This almost instantaneous media coverage of the event created a strong pressure of information demand on all those involved in the response operations, even before the establishment of structures for co-ordination and for the collection of reliable information on the event and its consequences.As an accident occurs, the emergency services must prioritise the following two main aspects of crisis management:*&nbsp; The mobilisation and the up-grading of the system for immediate emergency response*&nbsp; The activation of the co-ordination and command structure, in order to facilitate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The drawing up of a preliminary overview of the situation and the correct assessment of the event;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The activation of a structured system for gathering and recovering verified information;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Control of the spreading of the warning after the event.The last point can be achieved only by the activation of an operational command post on the site and of a crisis management team in an operational command room of the prefecture.

        "Finish Date": "1992-01-09 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nThe Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) was shut-down because of the failure of the air blowers that provided the oxygen to regenerate the catalyst in the regenerator. It was decided that the shut-down would be an opportunity to conduct some repairs and maintenance and also to monitor the condition of a new equipment configuration that had been recently installed within the regenerator. The catalyst was removed from the base of the generator by a nitrogen assisted steam reduction system until the entry into vessel was possible. The vessel was isolated in preparation (270 blinds had to be inserted before operational procedures allowed entry). The operational procedures that were followed were those that had been successfully used before. Although, it is now realized that they did not take into account the particular set of conditions (that is the large amount of un-regenerated catalyst) in this instance.At approximately 17:30 on Thursday 9, January, fitters started to remove 2 man-way covers on the generator. First a 30\" cover was removed to allow a preliminary visible inspection. No gas tests were made prior to opening as the system was considered to be open to atmosphere because of its flue to the stack. However, the removal of a valve and flow nozzle in the flue duct work may have reduced the draw of the flue on the regenerator and, therefore, contributed to an oxygen deficiency in the regenerator. The first cover was removed without mishap and the fitters proceeded to open a second 60\" man-way which was just being held by 2 bolts and a block and tackle. One bolt was removed when witnesses heard a rumbling noise from inside the regenerator. This was immediately followed by an orange-red flash came out on the left side of the man-way flange engulfing the group of workers on that side. After a few seconds, witnesses heard a seconf loud explosion. It occurred when the pressure wave from the first explosion reached the waste heat boiler (about 30 metres away) connected to the regenerator by a pipework.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENTS AND CONSEQUENCES:\nDuring the shut-down of the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit, it was decided to make some repairs and maintenance and to monitor the condition of a new equipment configuration that was installed within the catalyst regenerator. To allow the access into the regenerator, two man-ways were removed and this provided an oxygen entry which produced an explosive mixture with the gases from the contaminated catalyst. The flammable mixture was then ignited and a confined explosion occurred.\n\nCAUSES:\nThe initial failure of the blowers was caused by vibration to the blower turbine due to loose objects contacting the turbine blades. It has been assumed that these objects came from the actual engineering materials of the turbine itself.\nThe explosion was probably caused by a mixture of hydrogen, light hydrocarbon gases and carbon monoxide. This mixture was either above its auto-ignition temperature during the oxygen entry (when the man-way covers were removed) or was ignited by pyrophoric carbon deposits. The evolution of these gases was stimulated by the action of steam on the un-regenerated catalyst in an poor oxygen atmosphere (this reaction was discovered in subsequent laboratory experiments). This steam was injected immediately after the crash shut-down in an attempt to regenerate the catalyst and keep the catalyst bed fluid. The opening of the man-ways allowed sufficient oxygen enrichment for an explosive mixture in the previously stagnant internal regenerator atmosphere. This stagnation has thought to have occurred because of the new internal plant configuration which prevented the gases rising and escaping from the top flue and also because of the reduced flue draw caused by the removal of a valve and a nozzle in the ducts between the flue and the stack.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment, 24 people were injured by the explosion. Of these, 8 people were detained in the hospital and 2 of whom were transferred to the Burns Unit at the Hospital.MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion caused minor damage around the 60\" man-way but extensive damage to the waste heat boiler. No data are available about the cost of the damages.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The full site was alerted of the emergency. Water monitor sprays were trained onto the regenerator after the explosion. Approximately 70 people were involved in dealing with the accident.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The County Emergency Services were summoned.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- the catalyst will be cooled in future to 400\u00b0C before its unloading prior to entry;2- gas composition in the catalyst regenerator will be identified before the removal of the two man-way covers;3- the entry into any equipment of the catalyst circuit will be prohibited if the blower powdered by power recovery train fails and, therefore, the proper purging of the regenerator had not occurred;4- if purging would be necessary, it will be done using large quantities of steam over a long period of time to fluidify the catalyst bed and promote the reactions that cause the accident removing these dangerous by-products. This will also cool the catalyst bed.5- tighter control on personnel around future openings of man-way covers."

        "Accident Description": "In a chemical factory specialising in the production of plastics in primary forms, a fire broke out at about 09.25 in a fat extraction hopper of the 'fat collection' section located downstream from the polymerisation reactor and alongside a production line of the polyethylene plant, which produces copolymers. It had been restarted at 5.00 after some repairs. The area of the fat hopper that was affected was the upshot burner, which was emitting black smoke (pool fire). The plant's operators attempted to extinguish the fire with fire extinguishing balls, but the fire increased in intensity at about 9.42 (jet fire). The operator activated the internal emergency plan (POI), shut down the factory (by deflating the pipeline and stopping the circulation of thermal fluid) and evacuated the plant's 6 operators to the control room. The rescue services were alerted, but the on-site fire team intervened, managing to bring the fire under control by 10.15. The fire was extinguished at 11.44. Roughly 1 m\u00b3 of thermal fluid and a little under 3 t of ethylene were consumed by the fire. There were no casualties, but the hopper and nearby equipment suffered serious material damage estimated at EUR 3.6 million. The production line had to be shut down for 4 months.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The investigation carried out by the operator revealed that it was likely that lagging soaked in hot heat transfer fluid had caught fire. The ignition of the heat transfer fluid at 180 \u00b0C (the operating conditions of the fluid line), although below its self-ignition temperature (500 \u00b0C), is explained by the fact that the impregnation of the lagging with the fluid thereby lowered its self-ignition temperature. The heat released by the fire then caused the deformation of and a leak from equipment containing compressed ethylene, which in turn caught fire, leading to an augmentation in the intensity of the initial fire (jet fire).",
        "Consequences": "The hopper and nearby equipment suffered serious material damage estimated at EUR 3.6 million. The production line had to be shut down for 4 months.",

        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: The company has to review the drying process in order to avoid the recurrence of such an accident. No further investigations.Measures to prevent recurrence: From the analysis of the safety report presented to the competent authorities in compliance to the Italian legislation implementing the Seveso Directive it results that the accident which occurred was considered in the safety report as the most probable with respect to the specific equipment (plant). In relation to this a thorough analysis of possible fire causes had been realised, considering also historical data on fires in similar installations. To avoid the occurence of fires, adequate structural and operational measures had also been foreseen. Nevertheless the accident (fire) occurred, therefore it has to be assumed that it occurred because of the measures foreseen have been implemented not at all or only partially (inadequate implementation, causes identified but no adequate response). It appears that the company had planned to adopt further measures in addition to those indicated in the safety report in order to reduce the fire risk, measures which could not be implemented in time, due to the fire.Useful references: The models employed are those commonly employed for atmospheric releases forming clouds containing combustion products of solid substances (standard models)."

        "Finish Date": "2010-03-09 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The event took place in different stages since the early morning hours of February 23, 2010 within the depot of mineral oil and consisted of the spill, caused by an intentional action, of about 2,600 tons of hydrocarbons (Diesel fuel and Heavy fuel oil) from the pipes of the loading docks of the plant and in the repayment of the product. From here, after reaching the treatment plant of the nearby town through the main sewer, the product has been poured into the nearby Lambro river, causing contamination of the river downstream of the filter, with involvement of a second river, Po, in the stretch downstream from the mouth of the first river, the second river delta and the coastal area of the sea were affected by the waters of the second river. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "The hydrocarbons release occurred at n. 3 loading arms located on either loading docks existing respectively for diesel and heavy fuel oil and directly connected with N. 4 tanks in the fuel depot. -the spill has been poured out on the square of the load; -the substance overfilled the tanks of the API separator tank coming indirectly from the sewage system inside the plant and directly passed to curb protection likely due to saturation of the sewer system itself (part of it is also poured into the basins to contain fuel oil tanks). -the substance was drained from the API tank through the main valve, always kept open to allow the discharge of waste water from an hydraulic barrier aimed to remediation, to the sewer outside the plant, which flows into the main collector and from there to the treatment plant of the nearby city and finally into the nearby river.",
        "Consequences": "Off-Site Water bodies affected by the oil spill are the nearby river downstream of treatment plant of the town,the second river from the mouth of the first nearby river to the lagoons of the delta and coastal marine waters in front of the zone directly influenced by waters of the second river.In the emergency phase the quantity of the mixture of hydrocarbons (oil / fuel oil) being present in these water bodies, and their impact on water quality have been different, particularly severe on the first river and to a lesser extent in the second river and progressive decreasing to the sea,due to the dilution effect caused by the various tributaries of the second river's valley to the mouth of nearby river and the heavy rains. The emergency allowed the recovery of a quantity of product upstream of the sewage treatment equal to- 1250 tons retrieved at the treatment plant of the town - 300 tons recovered in the yards of Oil Depot for a total of about 1550 tons of product. Of the remaining 1050 tonnes of oil released into the nearby river downstream of the treatment plant of the town have been recovered: - 100 tons by means curtains made in the rivers - 450 tons at the dam on the second river for a total of about 550 tons of recovered product. Therefore about 500 tons are scattered along the rivers between the treatment plant of the town and the sea with a total length of river courses involved more than 300 Km. The extensive data collected show that the immediate consequences of the spill occurred at the superficial part of rivers consist mainly in a \"black wave\" of hydrocarbons that has passed between 23 and 28 February 2010. Along the stretch of the nearby river downstream of the treatment plant of the town to the confluence with the second river a WWF protected area and some urban parks in other nearby towns were involved. Downstream from the mouth of the first river along the shaft of second river are present n. 27 ZPS-SIC bordering sites designated and protected under the \"Habitats\" Directive 92/43/EEC and \"Birds\" Directive 79/409/EEC (recently revised by Directive 2009/147/EC). In a short time n.10 specimens belonging to two different species (cormorant and mallard) recovered in the hours following the event were died. From the findings identified by postmortem examinations apparent cause of death is poisoning not only by ingestion of hydrocarbons but also by transcutaneous absorption or inhalation. At the moment, an estimate of the animals killed by substances leaking is difficult, because many specimens of birds have been poisoned to death in remote and secluded areas. A comprehensive estimate of the damages is also difficult for the aquatic plant and animal communities that inhabit the ecosystems involved. Currently it is not possible to determine with certainty the actual amount of permanent or long-term damages to the various habitats caused by oil transit along the river courses and not intercepted by the actions of emergency put in place. Monitoring studies are being carried out under EC Directive 2000/60 involving different technical bodies both at central level and locally, with the goal of assessing the extent and impact caused by the discharge of hydrocarbons on the various environmental media (water, sediment, aquatic plant and animal communities). Only at the end of the monitoring activity it will be possible to obtain a complete picture of the actual extent of the damage, taking also into account the potential impact of the event on other water bodies and protected areas linked to the area directly affected by the oil spill. On-site The area affected by the event of release is located inside the industrial site and it is extended about 19,000 square meters. The first area of intervention has involved about 5000 square meters of land in front of the loading docks. First emergency activities have led to the production of solid waste due to the shelling of the land and the use of oil-absorbent material as well as aspiration of liquid waste from square, the API tank and the removal of the contaminated fluids derived from the decontamination of infrastructure in the depot. The solid waste has been stored in the establishment and partly disposed of by means of roll-off boxes and semi-ponds. The total quantity of soil/solid waste product is approximately 1700 tons for a fraction of oil products of 18 tons (identified on the basis of measured concentrations from the analysis of land). The liquid waste has been stored in tanks inside the plant provided by the Company. The amount of liquid waste was: 1060 tons of product hydrocarbon emulsions 569 tons of contaminated water 54 mc of sludge contaminated with hydrocarbons",
        "Emergency response": "On site On the first emergency phase corporate officers carried out the shutdown of the pumps, interruption of electricity and the interception of the spill by closing tanks and loading docks manual valves.Subsequently, in response to the presence of large quantities of oil that poured from the square load, directly or through the sewage system in the API separator pool, were activated fire protection systems (water cannons) to keep the product floating (above the ground). Then, according to the reconstruction made by the holders, the staff took steps to stop the flow of water from the wells of the hydraulic barrier (set up for reclamation of the site) to the API separator pool. At the same time the company contracted to perform emergency operations was immediately alerted in order to remove the product from the square load and the APIpool. Later, at about 9:00 am, technicians of the company that operates the sewage treatment plant of the city arrived at the factory to inquire about the registration of the anomalous presence of hydrocarbons at the inlet of its wastewater treatment plant. After having assessed the situation, the staff had taken steps to close (with difficulty) the valve located downstream of the pool API directly leading to the sewer outside the plant and connected to the sewage treatment plant itself. By the information transmitted to the central authorities by the local Fire Brigade, the request for assistance to the firemen at the Oil Depot was received at 10:59 on February 23, 2010 in relation to difficulties encountered in closing the valve from the tank API that connects the sewer to the main collector and from here at the treatment plant of the city.In this regard it should be noted that the emergency procedures of the establishment provide an immediate calling of the fire brigade in case of uncontrollable events within the plant. Off-Site Several containment actions have been put in place along the first river, downstream of treatment plant of city, and along the second river downstream of the confluence with the first river as a result of activation of the emergency occurred at approximately 8:00 am . The treatment plant of the city acted as physical barrier to contain part of the products along the first river. In addition to it the garrison prepared to contain products in corrispondence of an hydroelectric power plant river dam along the second river made it possible to mitigate the effects by limiting quantities of hydrocarbons released in the second river and protecting downstream uses in place of drinking water supply and irrigation, aquaculture and fish farming in the second river delta and the nearby sea. At the treatment plant of the city were recovered (by means auto drain) and disposed about 2,638 tons of oil/water emulsion (data up to March 2, 2010) with an average of 47%of hydrocarbons. At the power plant river dam were recovered most of the quantities of product not retained by the wastewater treatment plant and from the oil barriers played on the first river. The action of containment was achieved by raising the gates of the dam in order to facilitate the flow of water at the bottom and the containment of hydrocarbons on the surface. The product, consisting of a very viscous oil/water emulsion, was recovered using firstly oil skimmers. The process, due to the accumulation of plant debris that did not allow the proper functioning of the equipment, was secondarily guaranteed by means bucket load on a recovery barge. To facilitate the containment and recovery of hydrocarbons at the river dam, actions has been taken to facilitate the accumulation of the floating products on the right side of the river. With regard to actions aimed to wildlife preservation, action was done to removal of the birds in wildlife reserves by means helicopter flybys.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Notwithstanding the existence of intentional action as a primary cause of occurrence of the issue is clear, however, the absence/lack of technical systems and security management procedures that would normally be allowed to mitigate the consequences of the release: Absence of automatic systems for high / low alarm level on the tanks or automatic locking systems to serve the loading docks and / or its pumping equipment or systems for automatic optical or audible on the equipment (under a remote control) such as pumps for the transportation of hydrocarbons. Insufficient and / or failure to adopt appropriate anti-intrusion alarm systems in addition to the service provided guard designed to prevent acts of tampering or theft within the store or to allow the immediate activation of the actions of an emergency out of the regular time of opening. Insufficient and / or failure to adopt appropriate procedures for identifying and mitigating risks connected with the environmental consequences such as the closing of the valve located immediately downstream of the tank API in the presence of hydrocarbons. Insufficient and / or non-application of procedures for manual shut-down system maintenance especially in relation to the difficulties encountered in closing the valve downstream of the pool API separator. Failure implementation of emergency procedures which provide, in case of critical situations / uncontrolled activation of the immediate call to the fire station."

        "Start Date": "2000-06-10 03:20:00",
        "Finish Date": "2000-06-10 10:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Loss of containment of approximately 11.5 tonnes of flammable hydrocarbons at elevated temperature, following the failure of a 3\" branch on transfer line between fractionation columns, on fluidised catalytic cracker unit recovery section. The release ignited and the subsequent fire caused extensive damage to the plant.  No serious injuries.\n Discussion about the occurrence:On the evening of the 9th June the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) was in the process of being restarted. The \"front end\" (see Figure A) i.e. the cracking section was started up successfully by about midnight. The intention was to then start the \"back end\" Vapour Recovery Unit (VRU or \"light ends\" section) (see Figure B) of the plant by progressively introducing hydrocarbons into each of the columns in turn.The main fractionator and absorber columns were successfully brought on line and then material was introduced into the Debutaniser column (E5) sometime after 01.00 a.m.At this stage the control room operator had difficulty in achieving the correct temperature and pressure at the base of the column E5 and this resulted in the relief valves lifting. Problems were also experienced in maintaining the correct levels in the next column downstream (the Re-run column E6) due to gas being present in the pump which controlled the liquid levels in the column. This was a common problem experienced during start up conditions.During start-up and before transferring liquids from E5 to E6, standard operating practice for plant operators is to dewater the transfer line using a number of drain points on the system. Dewatering is essential because if the water in E5 (which is operated at a high temperature and pressure relative to the conditions in the column E6) was transferred into E6 it would result in the water immediately \"flashing off\" to produce steam. The transition between liquid and vapour phases is accompanied by significant volumetric changes and this could potentially damage the Re-run column E6.In order to dewater the column a drain point at the base of the column E5 on the outlet pipework is opened and water is allowed to escape to the local ground drains until hydrocarbons are observed coming out. This operation is carried out several times prior to transfer commencing in order to ensure that all the water has been removed. The hydrocarbons discharged to the drain system are subsequently removed in the effluent treatment systems for the Complex and are not discharged off-site.Following the dewatering procedure the transfer of liquid from the base of column E5 to column E6 was initiated by the control room operator at about 03.15 a.m. This was achieved by opening a flow control valve in a 6\" transfer line between the two columns.At approximately 03.19 a.m. operators working on the plant in the vicinity of the Debutaniser column reported a leak of hydrocarbons (described as a white vapour smelling of \"spirit\") coming from the base of E5 and drifting northwards towards the hot oil pumphouse. The control room operator was notified of the leak and immediately stopped the feed to the unit.At approximately 03.23 a.m. whilst the plant operators were investigating the source of the leak and beginning to isolate valves, the release ignited and the operators ran quickly to a place of safety. A serious fire developed at the base of E5 and this then had an impact on the adjacent columns and equipment. There were no injuries as a result of the incident. The fire was automatically detected by a fire detector located in the Hot Oil pump house facing the debutaniser column E5, which alerted the Control Room.The control room operator isolated the feeds to the \"light ends\" system using the distributed control system (DCS) and within two minutes, despite the number of audible and visual alarms significant isolation of inventories had taken place. The damage to instrumentation during the fire also meant that the control room operator was unable to view the condition of parts of the process through the DCS system.The prevailing wind direction at the time of the incident took the vapours into a relatively open area of the plant where the vapours were able to disperse relatively easily. If however the wind had been in a different direction towards an area where there was a congestion of plant and equipment and ignition had occurred the consequences may have been more serious. Such a scenario had previously been identified in the BP CIMAH/COMAH safety reports for the FCCU whereby the possibility of a vapour cloud explosion (VCE) had been considered.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Branch failed at welded joint to main transfer line. The branch had inadequate support and was vulnerable to vibration fatigue and/or shock loading.  Old plant, circa 1950's vintage.  Change made to configuration of branch pre-1987.  Poor change control.  Pipework inspected for corrosion only.  No proactive surveys for dead legs/redundant drains.\nThe primary immediate cause of this&nbsp; incident was the fracture of an unsupported 6x3\" reducing tee branch pipe to the main transfer line between the Debutaniser column (E5) and the Re-run column (E6) of the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU)&nbsp; (see Figure B) due to fatigue failure. This resulted in the release of highly flammable liquid/vapour at elevated temperature and pressure, which subsequently ignited(probably on an unprotected hot flange nearby).There were serious operational problems associated with the FCCU stage two modifications in 1997/98 which were a relevant underlying cause of this major accident.&nbsp; These were inadequately dealt with by BP despite recommendations in writing from the HSE to review the process after a torch oil explosion late in 1999.BP reviewed the FCCU earlier in 2000, partly to try to determine why it was not operating properly (eventually traced to a blocked cyclone dip leg) and to compare it with BP FCCU world standards. The review findings were not implemented or communicated properly.The CIMAH Fluidised\nCatalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) installation safety report 1997/98\nrevision claims and concludes that - \"hardware and software controls in\nplace on the FCCU are adequate to prevent the occurrence of a major\naccident which could affect the general public, the personnel working\non-site or the environment around it.\" Based on investigation findings,\nthis was partly unjustified even in 1997 when it was submitted, and\ncertainly did not reflect the reality by 10th June 2000 when the\ncumulative effects of unreliability, numerous plant start-ups,\nvibration and unsupported pipework factors came together. The safety\nreport was not proactively used as a management standard for reviewing\ncontinued safe operation, nor used as an audit tool to verify the\nclaims made for safe operation. There were serious deficiencies in the\nCOMAH compliance regime and the safety report did not reflect the\nreality of the plant operations and maintenance.",
        "Consequences": "Extensive fire damage to recovery section of plant.  Significant economic loss.  No serious injuries to on-site personnel.  No injury to off-site persons.  Potential contamination from asbestos insulation on process plant in surrounding area.  Concern expressed by local community.\n Area concerned - Remarks: There was substantial damage to high-level steelwork and access to parts of the site of the fire was restricted until the danger from falling steelwork had been assessed (see Photographs 1 -6).The contaminated firewater containing hydrocarbons from the plant was generated in excess of the capacity of the stormwater retention facilities on-site, and this resulted in the release of untreated firewater direct to the River Forth.&nbsp;Smoke and combustion products were also generated as a result of the fire. However, subsequent analysis of the surrounding environment, both on and off-site, showed no sign of significant levels of contamination as a result of the incident.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged, either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts, and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater.&nbsp; There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area.The Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) has several very small radioactive sources which are used for non-intrusive level measurement in the catalyst section. These were not involved in, or affected by, the fire. Ecological harm:Contaminated firewater containing hydrocarbons from the plant was generated in excess of the capacity of the stormwater retention facilities on-site and this resulted in the release of untreated firewater direct to the River Forth.Smoke and combustion products were also generated as a result of the fire. However, subsequent analysis of the surrounding environment both on and off-site showed no sign of significant levels of contamination as a result of the incident. Gas sampling carried out on the north bank of the River Forth found no abnormal levels of atmospheric pollutants following the incident.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged, either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts, and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater. There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area.Overall the investigation concluded that no significant environmental consequences were identified.Community Disruption:Although this incident did not directly affect the local population, it did cause significant local concern, as it was the third in a series of incidents which occurred at the site in a very short period of time.Following this incident (and two other non-reportable incidents which occurred at the same establishment between 29 May and 10 June 2000), the UK's Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) agreed that the HSE would prepare a non-statutory report on the incidents and would make it available to the public in accordance with the HSE's policies. The&nbsp; \"Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000\"&nbsp; (available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/index.htm) explains how and why the incidents occurred and summarises the subsequent investigations carried out by the Competent Authority and by BP.The report seeks to reassure the public that a series of thorough and detailed investigations into the causes of the incidents have been carried out by all parties concerned. In addition, the report is intended to demonstrate that a number of lessons have been learned both by BP and by the regulators and actions have been taken in order to improve safety performance at the Complex. The report is also intended to be viewed by a wider audience of companies, safety professionals and Trade Union representatives involved in the major accident hazard industries and to serve as a reminder of many of the issues that need to be addressed by safety reports for major hazard installations. Operators of major hazard sites are expected to carefully consider the contents of this report and the HSE will use Trade Association contacts, plus site inspection plans and other means, to publicise the incidents and to ensure the lessons are widely learned.Discussion of the Consequences:The fire developed on the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) at the base of E5 and had an impact on the adjacent columns and equipment. There were no injuries as a result of the incident.The prevailing wind direction at the time of the incident took the vapours into a relatively open area of the plant where the vapours were able to disperse relatively easily. If, however, the wind had been in a different direction, towards an area where there was a congestion of plant and equipment and ignition had occurred, the consequences may have been more serious. Such a scenario had previously been identified in the BP CIMAH/COMAH safety reports for the FCCU whereby the possibility of a vapour cloud explosion (VCE) had been considered.The fire reached its maximum intensity within 20 minutes but within 40 minutes started to decline as a result of a reduction in available fuel and the use of aggressive fire-fighting techniques (water and foam). Within 90 minutes the fire size had reduced considerably to the point where the remaining inventory could be allowed to burn off.The incident was brought under control and several hours later (around 10:00 a.m.) the incident was declared to be over. Damage was mainly limited to columns and associated equipment on the \"light ends\" section in the vicinity of column E5. Passive structural fire protection prevented significant damage to surrounding structures.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged, either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts, and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater.&nbsp; There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the response to asbestos concerns following the FCCU fire see the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/index.htm.Gas sampling carried out on the north bank of the River Forth found no abnormal levels of atmospheric pollutants following the incident. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the environmental impact of the FCCU fire see the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/impact.htm.Towards the end of the incident, due to the large quantity of water used for fire-fighting, and the fact that the capacity of the storm water tanks was effectively reduced by recent heavy rain, the storm water tanks in the Oil Refinery effluent treatment system became filled. Contaminated effluent from the FCCU containing hydrocarbon liquids was diverted directly into the Forth Estuary.BP made the plant safe by isolating sections of the plant using existing valves and then by determining how to safely dispose of inventories of flammable material. There was substantial damage to high level steelwork and access to parts of the site of the fire was restricted until the danger from falling steelwork had been assessed.",
        "Emergency response": "On-site fire brigade and external brigade attended.&nbsp; Personnel to muster points.&nbsp; Decontamination of site underway, mainly for asbestos.&nbsp; No disruption to public.Emergency measures - Remarks: Having been informed of the leak, the control room operator isolated the feeds to the \"light ends\" system using the distributed control system (DCS) and within two minutes, despite the number of audible and visual alarms, significant isolation of inventories had taken place. The damage to instrumentation during the fire also meant that the control room operator was unable to view the condition of parts of the process through the DCS system.In response to the original identification of the leak, the on-site emergency services were called to attend (03:21 a.m.) and by the time they arrived at the scene, ignition had occurred. They quickly set up portable fire appliances to control the spread of the fire.The Central Scotland Fire Brigade was notified by a 999 call at 03:29 a.m. following the ignition. They arrived at the scene at 03.39 a.m. and assisted in controlling the incident. The fire was initially attended by five mobile units along with a decontamination and control unit. Subsequently a further five mobile units attended with a standby foam tanker.At 03.33 a.m. the Oil Refinery muster point alarm was sounded.Plant operators helped the emergency services by closing manual valves (for example at the fractionator column) and by shutting down pumps to minimise the quantity of material released. The control room operator was limited in the extent to which he could assist to isolate inventories remotely because many isolations could only be done manually.The BP Grangemouth Incident Management Team was called out and within 30 minutes the Grangemouth Petrochemical Complex Major Incident Control Committee (MICC) had been activated at Grangemouth police station. Some difficulties were experienced with the reception of emergency responders and with MICC communications. Control of the access to the incident site was initially difficult to achieve.The fire reached its maximum intensity within 20 minutes but within 40 minutes started to decline as a result of a reduction in available fuel and the use of aggressive fire-fighting techniques (water and foam). Within 90 minutes the fire size had reduced considerably to the point where the remaining inventory could be allowed to burn off.The incident was brought under control and several hours later (around 10:00 a.m.) the incident was declared to be over. Damage was mainly limited to columns and associated equipment on the \"light ends\" section in the vicinity of column E5. Passive structural fire protection prevented significant damage to surrounding structures.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater.&nbsp; There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the response to asbestos concerns see the asbestos investigation in the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/index.htm.Gas sampling carried out on the north bank of the River Forth found no abnormal levels of atmospheric pollutants following the incident. Towards the end of the incident, due to the large quantity of water used for fire-fighting, and the fact that the capacity of the storm water tanks was effectively reduced by recent heavy rain, the storm water tanks in the Oil Refinery effluent treatment system became filled. Contaminated effluent from the FCCU containing hydrocarbon liquids was diverted directly into the Forth Estuary.BP made the plant safe by isolating sections of the plant using existing valves and then by determining how to safely dispose of inventories of flammable material. There was substantial damage to high-level steelwork and access to parts of the site of the fire was restricted until the danger from falling steelwork had been assessed.The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility.For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the environmental impact of the FCCU fire see the environmental impact investigation in the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/response.htm.Official action taken - legal action: The HSE alleged breaches of health and safety law and BP Grangemouth Oil Refinery Limited were served with an indictment for breaches of the Health &amp; Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 Section 2. The company was found guilty and fined \u00a3750,000.An Improvement Notice was served on the company relating to asbestos management.Official action taken - other action: Following this incident (and two other non-reportable incidents which occurred at the same establishment between 29 May and 10 June 2000), the UK's Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) agreed that the HSE would prepare a non-statutory report on the incidents and would make it available to the public in accordance with the HSE's policies. The&nbsp; \"Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000\" (available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/index.htm) explains how and why the incidents occurred, and summarises the subsequent investigations carried out by the Competent Authority and by BP.The report seeks to reassure the public that a series of thorough and detailed investigations into the causes of the incidents have been carried out by all parties concerned. In addition the report is intended to demonstrate that a number of lessons have been learned both by BP and by the regulators, and actions have been taken in order to improve safety performance at the complex. The report is also intended to be viewed by a wider audience of companies, safety professionals and Trade Union representatives involved in the major accident hazard industries and to serve as a reminder of many of the issues that need to be addressed by safety reports for major hazard installations. Operators of major hazard sites are expected to carefully consider the contents of this report and the HSE will use Trade Association contacts, plus site inspection plans and other means, to publicise the incidents and to ensure the lessons are widely learned.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:The Competent Authority investigation required that BP should take the following measures before re-introduction of hydrocarbon to the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) \"light ends\" section. The incident has substantial commercial implications for the site. (The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility).Demonstration that the mechanical integrity of pipework on the \"light ends\" section of the FCCU is assured, in particular, with respect to the following:a. Stresses caused by: \u00b7Fabrication;Assembly and erection, including misalignment and structural attachments;Mechanically induced vibration cycling;Temperature effects and thermal cycling;Self weight and effect of supports, restraints and guides;Reaction forces and other shock loading;Pressure;Erosion, corrosion and environmental cracking.b. Dead legs and drain points to be minimised and, where retained, assessed against the above failure modes.c. Redundant equipment and pipework, including drain/vent points, to be removed, where practicable.The HSE investigation also recommended that improvements be made in the following areas of FCCU operation:-Change control - rigorous change control procedures should be employed.Risk assessment - a review of the FCCU risk assessment should be undertaken which considers critical process effects on start-up, e.g. de-watering, opening FCVs, exceeding process parameters, thermal cycling, transmitted vibration etc.Control/instrumentation/electrical equipment.Management review - a high level overview of unit operations should be maintained to ensure abnormal operation of the process plant is identified and the full implications assessed.Communications/competency - process technicians should receive additional training and instructions to enable them to recognise situations where there may be serious implications for process plant. BP confirmed that these recommendations would be addressed before the FCCU was started up again and would be dealt with in the design of the revamped \"light ends\" section.Measures to mitigate consequences:The Competent Authority investigation required that BP should take the following measures before re-introduction of hydrocarbon to the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) \"light ends\" section. The incident has substantial commercial implications for the site. (The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility).Emergency Shutdown ArrangementsDemonstration that adequate arrangements have been identified for the emergency shutdown of the \"light ends\" section of the FCCU need to be considered (in particular the following):a. Installation of remotely operated shut-off valves (ROSOVs) to allow rapid remote isolation of significant process inventories in order to minimise the consequences of an uncontrolled leak and allow remote emergency shutdown of ancillary equipment, such as pumps;b. Safe means for emergency depressurisation of columns or vessels, where reasonably practicable.Alarm FloodingDemonstration that adequate arrangements have been identified to ensure a timely and effective response by Central Control Building operators to those alarms necessary for the prevention and mitigation of major accidents, taking due account of the number, presentation and rate of presentation of alarms during plant start up, or other upset conditions, and any relevant factors set out in industry best practice guidelines (the Engineering Equipment and Material User's Association (EEMUA) guidelines).BP has implemented a range of measures to address these issues. Emergency response plans have now been updated to an agreed format and include reference where required to radioactive sources.&nbsp; Storm water tank capacity is being reviewed as part of the Complex sustaining capital programme.&nbsp; Procedures have been established to address the possible release of a range of substances into the effluent treatment plant during a fire or major incident.BP have reviewed and improved the on-site incident management plan.&nbsp; Area fire plans have been updated to the agreed format. A full review of the on-site emergency support provision has been carried out and improvements to the team organisation and facilities have been implemented.BP recognised the problems caused by alarm flooding and work had been commenced at the site to address the problem. A project is now under way to put software in place to manage the prioritisation of alarms properly. The projected timescale of 5 years for completion has been accepted by the Competent Authority.BP also carried out their own investigation into this incident. This resulted in a new site-wide emergency response procedure being issued to address handling asbestos and ceramic fibres during emergencies.Useful References:The official report into incident \"Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000\" is available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk./comah/bpgrange/index.htm.Alarm HandlingCHIS6 - HSE Information Sheet: Chemicals Sheet No 6 - Better alarm handlingTo download see www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/chis6.pdfEEMUA Guidance - Alarm systems, a guide to design, management and procurement.

        "Accident Title": "Emission of benzene on a petrochemical site",
        "Start Date": "2010-04-09 21:45:00",
        "Finish Date": "2010-04-12 19:20:00",
        "Accident Description": "During a transfer of benzene at a petrochemical plant, the pumps for transferring the benzene from the storage tanks to the rail wagons stalled regularly over the course of the afternoon, requiring the operators to repeatedly purge them before re-priming. At 21:45, a VOC (volatile organic compound) detector triggered an alarm to the central control room, and another hydrocarbon alarm was tripped at the entrance to the complex's final effluent treatment plant 15 min later, followed by other alarms triggered by VOC sensors at the same station. The operator then inspected its premises and noted that benzene was overflowing at the outlet of one of the primary separation pits of the effluent collection network. Two other separation pits connected between themselves and with the above-mentioned, located near the storage areas used in the afternoon, also proved to be filled with benzene.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The operator's investigations revealed that the volume of benzene purged from the pumps would normally have flowed into the collecting pits linked to a covered hydrocarbon-processing installation. However, two days before the accident, this pit's outflow channel, which had previously been emptied, had been shut off and the volume purged that day exceeded the capacity of the pit, which caused it to overflow into the site's effluent separation and treatment network.",
        "Consequences": "The operator's report showed that the volume of effluents emitted into the Merle stream on 10 April was 9 289 m3 over 10 hours, representing an average benzene concentration of 9.3 mg/l, which surpassed the authorised emissions threshold for the processing plant (1.5 mg/l), i.e. 72 kg above the authorised daily benzene threshold.\n",
        "Emergency response": "At 23:00 the operator of the complex's final effluent treatment plant channelled the effluents, which had been pre-skimmed in the settling tanks, into the overflow basin. The overflow ceased at 23:30.\nAt 03:45, the operator ordered the pits to be covered with foam in order to limit the evaporation of benzene, because the VOC detectors of the local monitoring network had measured for one hour and 15 min concentrations of benzene exceeding the threshold for informing the local municipalities (0.325 mg/m3 for two consecutive fifteen-minute periods), with spikes exceeding the threshold of 1 mg/m3 being measured at 02:00. However, the foam layer could not be put in place in the processing plant, whose basins have moving skimmers.\nOn the next morning, the operator started to empty the contaminated pits and spread sand on the connecting channel in order to absorb the benzene, which was then recovered and stored in drums. The hydrocarbon separation pits and the processing plant's storm water basin were also emptied, recovering 50 m3 of contaminated water, containing about 10 tonnes of benzene. The pumping operations ended four days later.\nAs soon as the warning threshold for atmospheric benzene was surpassed, faxes were sent to the nearby municipalities. The operator issued a press release on the morning of the second day and in the afternoon informed the municipalities that the accident had ended.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "To correct the situation, the operator installed a high level detector in the collector pit and a hydrocarbon sensor in the overflow channel and reviewed its procedures. "

        "Accident Description": "On 26 January 2012, a pressure increase occurred during production of phenolic resin in a reactor at a synthetic resin plant. This led to a corresponding reaction from a rupture disc in the reactor. The reaction mixture discharged could be partially contained in a downstream blowdown vessel. The gas phase of the mixture was released into the atmosphere following a relief of pressure caused by the blowdown vessel.\nWind then caused the gas phase (aerosol cloud) to disperse which affected neighbouring businesses. Continued operation of other reactors involved in phenolic resin production which were connected to the catch tank was prohibited by the relevant district government. Accounting by the company revealed that the reaction mixture caused 249 kg of phenols and 579 kg of formaldehyde to be released into the atmosphere. - Emergency response activated.\n- Emergency services and authorities alerted.\n- Routine plant shut-down.\n- Support from emergency services.",
        "Causes of the accident": "According to current information:\n- A non-routine programme cycle intended for accompanying process development was activated in the process control system.\n- The increased start temperature of 120 \u00b0C disabled the \u2018Cooling water valve to automatic\u2019 breakpoint.\n- The load entered the exothermic phase without being cooled.",
        "Consequences": "Odour nuisance for approximately 1 hour",
        "Emergency response": "- Emergency response activated,\n- Emergency services provided with information. On-site: contamination absorbed by bonding agents Industrial area closed off,\n- Medical assistance,\n- Decontamination unit at plant entrance. - Periodic plant evacuation.\n- Periodic plant evacuation of neighbouring company. Absorption of local contamination at plant site by means of bonding agents.\n- Decontamination of protective clothing and shoe soles by fire brigade at plant site.\n- Residue from reactor and catch tank removed for disposal.",
        "Lesson Learned": "On the basis of a final expert report the operator submitted an application for approval of a new safety plan for the reactor affected and other reactors in the synthetic resin plant. The operator was subsequently ordered to apply the safety plan in accordance with \u00a7 17(1) BImSchG (Federal Immission Control Act)."

        "Accident Description": "An evaporator had to be taken out of operation because of the crystalline deposits inside it.A decision was taken to use the time when the evaporator was out of operation to also remove the deposits accumulated in a refilling container (in the basement).Over approximately 10 years, the concentrate from the vacuum evaporator (evaporator used to concentrate electroplating wastewater) has accumulated in this refilling container.\nSince water failed to dissolve the hard residue, together with a waste management facility, we initially considered using mining techniques to remove the sediment from the container. The waste management facility took a sample of the sediment and analysed it.The result showed that this method of removal was possible, but difficult because of the spatial constraints, and would be dangerous for the waste management facility staff.As a result, the search for products which could dissolve the sediment began.\nLaboratory scale experiments showed that the sediment could be dissolved with sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), this was likewise discussed with the waste management facility.H2SO4 did not come into consideration, as it would generate significant amounts of foam and gas.Dissolving the sediment with HCl would not generate foam or lead to a discernible gas formation. Moreover, this mixture would not generate heat.\nThe waste management facility was then provided with a sample of the waste product, the sediment with HCl in liquid form. The waste management facility was able to treat/neutralise this liquid without any problems.Then, a plastics engineering company was consulted in order to check whether the container would be able to withstand HCl. This was confirmed.\nIn order to make this procedure (not part of normal operation) safe, a further experiment was carried out.2 kg of the sediment from the container was mixed with approx. 1.5 litres of HCl (sediment in a container, addition of acid, leave to stand without mixing). This experiment likewise did not generate foam, discernible gas or heat.\nThe timetable was set as follows:Addition of HCl on 13 August 2021.Pickup of the mixture by the waste management facility on 19 August 2021.\nNo anomalies were detected after the addition of HCl on 13 August 2021 ([completed] at approx. 07:00).Around noon, a chlorine-like smell was perceptible in the building.The room where the refilling container, and therefore also the container with the mixture, were located, was then checked. An open manhole was found. The manhole was sealed and the exhaust air system of the container (with a built-in scrubber) was turned on.This took place around 14:30, and the maintenance staff had already finished work for the day. Before leaving, they had turned off the exhaust, because they didn't think it still had to be on.The staff working on the ground floor, near the basement exit, had been told to keep an eye out for how things develop. At that time, it had been assumed that the smell was due to the exhaust air system being switched off and the failure to close the manhole.\nFollowing an error message in the fire alarm system, the guards notified the alarm service. The alarm service inspected the room again. By that time, the maintenance foreman was on site, and he discussed the clear deterioration with the plant operator on the phone.\nAs a result, first the fire brigade and then the competent authority within the LANUV (Landesamt f\u00fcr Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, State Office for Nature Conservation, Environmental Protection and Consumer Protection) were notified.The staff were brought to various hospitals in the area as a precaution.Around 01:15, it was decided to evacuate the residents and then continue with the removal of the mixture.After the evacuation, around 05:15, the container emptying process began. It was concluded within minutes.After re-measurement at the exposure site \u2013 3 ppm, the all-clear was given and the emergency personnel began the clean-up.\nAfter removal of the mixture, the fire brigade measured a value of 3 ppm at the source location \u2013 14 August 2021 around 06:00.In the region of the entrance into the source location (central section/ground floor height difference approx. 4 m), a concentration of 1.4 ppm was measured on 14 August 2021. After closing the entrance and waiting approx. 1 hour \u2013 0.2 ppm.Furthermore, a distinct smell was still perceptible at the external door of the source location.\nIn the view of the operator, this means that a reaction was still ongoing in the source location itself (according to the waste management facility, approx. 1 cm of sediment was left in the container). We believe that the gas formation was caused by a reaction of HCl with components of the deposits.Because of the continuous chlorine emissions, the police initially blocked off the area.After the readings within plant premises fell below the exposure limit values, the plant could be entered again \u2013 with the exception of the basement, which remained closed off. The basement was temporarily closed off with foil and tape, to prevent chlorine gas from spreading into the other parts of the plant.The remaining sediments were removed by a specialised company.This scenario cannot happen again because the installation which had caused the sediments has now been permanently shut down.\nSafety measures:Evacuation of staff from the plant, notification of the fire brigade and the LANUV.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Probable reaction of sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid.\nCause could not be established at the end of the investigation.",
        "Consequences": "Customer parts, machine equipment.\nEvacuation of 350 people over approx. 6 hours.",

        "Emergency response": "The surrounding area was checked with gas detectors.Professional fire brigade attended in response to the automatic fire alarm. Their access to the site was delayed by the works gate not being connected to the emergency power supply.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nRestore the correct wiring of the fan control in emergency power mode.\nFunctional tests of the fan in emergency power mode.\nProtecting the switch panel from rodents.\nConnection of the works gate to the emergency power supply.\n\nCompetent authority's response:The failure was caused by a short circuit in the switch panel of a distribution station, which was caused by the ingress of a rodent (dormouse). Despite the fact that the amount of gas released was low and that there was no risk to the public, the lessons learned from this are important for plant safety.\n\nIntrusion by rodents must be avoided or prevented.In general, potential malfunctions caused by animals, e.g. insects, birds, rodents, etc., should be investigated and taken into account in plant operations, e.g. regular checks for animal nests, gnawed components such as cables, rodent droppings in \u2018closed spaces\u2019, etc.\nEmergency services must be able to access the site at all times.&nbsp;As a result of the power failure, the power-operated gate lost power and had to be opened manually using cranks. Future connection to the emergency power will ensure that the gate can be opened quickly.\nWhere provision is made to switch over to the emergency power system, this must be checked and, as far as possible, tested in order to ensure full operation.A missing signal cable meant that the boil-off fan could not be activated and the gas could not be transferred to the low-pressure storage tank. As a result, the discharge dampers had to be opened in order to avoid dangerous overpressure.\nIf the emergency power system had been working properly, there would have been no release of gas despite the power failure.\nAs the error was caused by a modification in the control room, this event highlights the importance of effective change management for the safety of the plant. Change management must also include appropriate checks and test procedures.\n\nThese findings are not only applicable to gas plants or LNG storage facilities. The points listed are of general importance for plant safety and can be applied appropriately on a case-by-case basis.\nCovered by operational safety measures (work instructions, safety valves, blowers, Ex zones)."

        "Accident Description": "An operator got the task to test the main flare facility of the plant after maintenance work. During this maintenance work a smaller flare was used which was sufficient because a large portion of the installations wasn't operational because of maintenance. During the test of the main flare the operator by accidently closed the main valve of the natural gas supply instead of the valve on the supply branch for the main flare.\u00a0As a result the plant was tripped because a number of devices (such as compressors) didn't function any more and was then shut down completely. As a result of this a large quantity of process gas was sent to the flare but the smaller flare's pilot flame was extinguished because of the lack of supply of natural gas. So a large cloud of process gas could leave the installation unburned through the smaller flare. The cloud contained among other gases 32 tonnes of ethylene and 4 tonnes of propylene. The whole company had to be evacuated. The accident ended after the cloud was dispersed.",
        "Causes of the accident": "An operator closed the wrong valve at the natural gas supply station.There was no instruction for the test of the main flare he was performing.",

        "Causes of the accident": "Orica gathered a team of senior executives and technical specialists from other departments in Orica\u2019s international organization. The accident investigation followed the Incident Cause and Analysis Method (ICAM).\nBased on evidence collected to date, it is believed from the company\u2019s investigation that the most probable sequence of events was:\n\nInitiation: a friction event was caused by rotation of a bolt on PETN hopper flange using a steel spanner. This action is likely to have resulted in initiation of residual PETN.\nPropagation: the initiation propagated from the bolt area inwards towards the PETN hopper.\nMass Explosion: PETN hopper had not been emptied of inventory prior to maintenance. It is estimated that mass of PETN in hopper was approximately between 250 and 750 grams. Propagation resulted in mass detonation of PETN in hopper.\n\nAt the time of the explosion the process and the filling station wasn't in progress. The logs doesn't indicate that there were any problems with the filling station.",

        "Accident Description": "The explosive fire took place on March 2nd, 2018, at an aerosol filling plant in Sipoo in Finland. One person was injured in the accident, and the production facilities and equipment were destroyed. The investigation concluded that a probable chain of events was that solvent vapors rose close to the ceiling where there was no adequate ventilation. The vapor ignited when a worker opened a vertical lift door. To avoid similar accidents in the future, the investigative team recommends that adequate ventilation is ensured in plants that handle solvents and gases.",
        "Causes of the accident": "On the day of the accident the plant was operating as usual. The workers had not detected anything out of the normal.\nThe source of the leak could not be identified with certainty. It is deemed probable that due to inadequate ventilation solvent vapours or flammable gas accumulated in the upper parts of the building. Ignition was probably caused by the stopping mechanism of the vertical lift door, static electricity or an electrical appliance. According to the workers inside the building, the indoor gas detectors did not sound an alarm before the accident.",
        "Consequences": "An explosive gas mixture ignited when a worker opened a vertical lift door from the outside. A pressure wave broke lightweight concrete blocks in the exterior wall, and doors and windows were thrown out into the yard. A worker was injured due to the pressure release. The acetone mixture and LPG pipelines were damaged which resulted in a flammable liquid and gas release into the production facilities.This caused that the fire developed rapidly inside the building.",
        "Emergency response": "Areal fire brigade arrived on site 10 minutes after alarm. They managed to limit the fire at production areas. Fire was extinguished using foam. Water was used to protect LPG tanks and storage building nearby.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Technology related recommendations:\n\nAdequacy of ventilation must be monitored regularly\nPressure relief must be designed and carried out so that the buildup of pressure cannot cause collapse of structures or buildings, or damage to pipelines\nThere must be enough gas detectors in facilities where explosive mixtures may be present\nAlarms from gas detectors must be detectable in all places where workers may be in danger and near entrance doors.\nVertical lift doors are not suitable as emergency exits\nThe amount of hazardous chemicals in the production facilities should be limited to be as low as possible (e.g. the needs of one shift).\nIt is recommended to attach the gas alarm to the safety automation system, e.g. to de-energize electrical equipment and close valves\n\nRecommendations related to organizational activities:\n\nTasks that are meant to ensure safety must be identified, as well as workers who are responsible for the execution of these tasks\nThe management must supervise that these tasks are carried out\nThe company must be aware of the legislation that regulates its activities\nThe company must systematically monitor how the implementation of demands and recommendations from authorities are carried out\nSystematic maintenance must be carried out. Records must be kept of all implemented maintenance activities\nThe workers must be trained to work safely, and they must be told about the plant\u2019s hazards. Temporary workers must also be trained.\nThe company must inform the supervising authority when changes are made that concern the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals.\n"

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nThe accident involved a reactor used to oxidize a pyridine compound with hydrogen peroxide using a maleic anhydride catalyst to form a pyridine-N-oxide. The reaction was recognised to be exothermic; therefore, hydrogen peroxide was added at controlled rates. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide plug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For \nfurther peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was emitted into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area when the accident occurred, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident.\nThe oxidation reactor was located in a process room dedicated to the synthesis of 2-chloropyridine with 70% hydrogen peroxide using a maleic anhydride catalyst to form a pyridine-N-oxide.&nbsp; The reaction was recognized to be exothermic. It was controlled by the rate of addition of the peroxide to a well stirred mixture of the catalyst in pyridine compound. The required peroxide for each batch was transferred from bulk storage to an intermediate holding tank. This tank was located on the ground floor process area and the peroxide was pumped into the reactor via a flow meter. The pyridine was pumped into the reactor from 200 litres drums. The catalyst was added from 50 kg bags through the man-hole. The safety features for this exothermic reaction included: circulation of the reactor contents through two heat exchangers during oxidation; a 200 cm pressure relief line to atmosphere with a 0.7 bar bursting disc; a water quench tank located 3 metres above the reactor, which would automatically dump its contents into the reactor should a sudden temperature increase (&gt; 3\u00b0C) occur. The peroxide addition pump would not operate if: the quench tank was not full; the circulation pump was not operating; the reactor's vent was not open to the atmopshere. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide slug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For further peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly and resulted in a runaway reaction. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was released into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident. The investigations carried out by the company after the accident showed that approximately 115 Kg of peroxide were added to the reactor over a 3 minutes period instead of the normal 4.5 kg/minute. The subsequent company investigations found valves 4 and 5 closed on the peroxide transfer line and valves 1, 2 and 3 opened just after the accident. For the above accelerated rate of peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 must have been opened. It is thought that an operator failed to close the valves 4 and 5 and opened valves 1, 2 and 3 following the operating instructions. Just after the explosion, he must have realised his mistake and reset the valves in accordance with the correct instructions before the accident investigations.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nThe investigations carried out by the company after the accident showed that approximately 115 kg of peroxide were added to the reactor over a 3 minutes period instead of the normal 4.5 kg/minute. The subsequent company investigations found valves 4 and 5 closed on the peroxide transfer line and valves 1, 2 and 3 opened just after the accident.

Just after the accident, he must have realised his mistake and reset the valves in accordance with the correct instructions before the accident investigations. The accelerated rate of peroxide addition resulted in an exothermic runway reaction. Besides, the process analysis and the design plant were not adequate.\nThe explosion was caused by a runaway reaction (code 5106) that occurred because of an addition rate of hydrogen peroxide higher than that expected. It was caused by an operator error (code 5401) in following the operating procedures. Besides, the process analysis and the design plant were not adequate (codes 5307 and 5308).",
        "Consequences": "OTHER:The effects of the explosion were negligible (no plants were damaged by the accident).People - Remarks: As no operators were working in the process area when the accident occurred, no one was injured by the explosion but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "Emergency measures - Remarks: Although the quench system was immediately activated (code 7102) when the reactor's temperature suddenly increase, the runaway reaction resulted in an explosion. No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the Industrial Inspectorate required the company to:\n1- close the reactor man-hole during oxidation;\n2- remove the by-pass on the peroxide transfer line;\n3- provide an emergency dump tank on the reactor 200 cm vent line."

        "Accident Description": "Upon opening/lifting the retention cover (installed in the column flange of the hand hole), the staff at the scene noticed a crackling or hissing noise. The work area was evacuated as quickly as possible and the staff left the platform via a stairway. Even before the staff could reach the ground, around 09:01, there was an explosion-like bang at the open manhole followed by a fire ball. A fire then broke out.The subsequent root cause analysis revealed the following sequence of events:- The introduction of impact energy at the start of the work when opening the retention cover of the column filling initiated a reaction of the polymers.- Decomposition reaction of the stored acetylene compounds and terminal triple hydrocarbon bonds.- Reproduction of the decomposition reaction in the polymerisate (\u2018deflagration in solids') within the column, resulting in the formation of combustible gases (including H2 and other volatile aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons), soot, and reaction heat.- reaction heat (= decomposition energy) resulted in the evaporation of the residual moisture (water) and hydrocarbon compounds included in the polymerisate.Evaporated substances escaped from the column as white vapour and formed a flammable/explosive atmosphere outside the column.- Build-up of pressure in the column from the vapours and gases formed.- Pressure in the column causes the retention cover to come loose with a jolt and fly out.- Spontaneous release of pressure as the vapours streamed out from the column, taking with them the aggregate from the filling.- Ignition of the gas cloud outside the column due to sparks from the flying filler debris.- Fire outside the column fed/maintained by continuing flow of combustible gases formed by the ongoing (decay) reactions inside the column.It is assumed that there was no fire inside the column because:- Flames were coming out from/at all openings of the column so that no oxygen could enter the column;- the jacket of the column is undamaged; in the event of an internal fire, at least the external corrosion coating (zinc epoxy resin) would have had to show signs of melting.- Deposits taken from another manhole are still combustible.Safety measures:Immediately after the explosion and outbreak of fire, the fire brigade was called and further action was taken in accordance with the site emergency plan and the company emergency plans.Water was also sprayed into the head of the column through the existing condensate feed in order to dissipate the energy being released in the column.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The process deposits (so-called polymerisates) have molecule groups with terminal, unstable carbon triple bonds. The polymerisates also contain highly volatile, flammable hydrocarbons. This includes unstable higher acetylene compounds such as vinylacetylene and diacetylene. Safety studies have shown that the deposits (polymers including the unstable acetylene compounds deposited) show sensitivity to decomposition when exposed to impact energy and release large amounts of energy on decomposition.This explains why the application of energy during the lifting of the retention cover was sufficient to initiate a decomposition reaction and subsequently generated sufficient energy to allow the decomposition reaction to continue in the form of a deflagration in solid.",
        "Consequences": "Seven people were indirectly affected by the event and attended the works medical service.Damage to insulation, EMR equipment and grate platforms.Costs: &euro;500,000",
        "Emergency response": "During the event:- Launch of the rescue chain in accordance with the emergency plan.- Evacuation of the plant.- Transport of the affected persons to chemical park medical service and subsequent examination.- Closure of ducts (production waste water duct and rainwater duct) to retain fire-fighting water and to prevent contamination of wastewater systems.- air quality monitoring by measuring vehicles outside the chemical park.(No elevated concentrations of pollutants were measured.)After the event:- Cordoning off the surroundings of the area affected by the fire.- Closure of all the grate platforms on the columns, as their stability could no longer be guaranteed.- Sampling of the fire-fighting waters in the plant collection basins and release of the water to the production waste water duct after negative results.- Declaration of the area as a contaminated area due to possible fire residues; including continuous sampling and analysis of components for contaminants.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Increase in alkali concentration in the normal process to reduce the formation of reactive polymerisates.Extension of the cleaning process as follows:-The column remains under nitrogen until the fillers are removed in order to prevent an explosive atmosphere in the column.- Steaming of the column with low-pressure steam to expel hydrocarbons stored in the polymerisate structure so as to reduce the decomposition energy and the proportion of decomposable and/or combustible gases.The steaming also reduces unstable terminal triple bonds in the polymerisates.The effect of steaming has been proven by chemical analysis and safety studies.- Flooding of the column with water for at least two days in order to allow water to be stored in the polymerisates and thus reduce the decomposition energy. The water is not drained until just before the fillers are removed in order to prevent the polymerisates from drying out.- Connection of the column\u2019s recirculation pipe to the water network in order to pour up to 20 t/h of water into the head of the column immediately any decomposition reaction begins. This can reduce or completely prevent the spread of any decomposition reaction that may occur.- Evacuate and cordon off the area around the columns for the duration of the cleaning work.- Inform the fire brigade of the time and duration of the cleaning work in order to minimise response time."

        "Accident Description": "Discharge of acid substances from an industrial process following the failure of a transfer pipe between the site and the discharge point.The accident can be classified in the OECD framework (off-site transfer pipe). However, as the pipe belongs to a Low Threshold Seveso site, it was notified under MARS as an \"other event\".The event was classified level 3 of the scale, as published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso directive (cost of repairs in excess of 5.8 Meuros).The accident: On 7 August 2002 at 12.01 a.m., the pipe monitoring system (line balance) detected a leak of 100 m3/h (out of a nominal flow of 500 m3/h) of secondary water (dilute sulphuric acid: concentration less than or equal to 15 g/l of sulphate), at a pressure of 5 bars. An inspection was made by the operator on the ground and in all ducts over the whole route of the pipe in order to identify the leak. Assessed at about 20 m3, the leak was due to fissuring on 40 cm of a pipe within the boundaries of the Le Havre plant. After the faulty section had been replaced, the whole of the pipe was tested again and the facility returned to operation. Four days later, on Sunday 11 August 2002 at 8.05 p.m. a new leak occurred which the monitoring system at once detected. The nominal flow was then 440 m3/h (dilute sulphuric acid), at a pressure of 3.9 bars (these conditions are however lower than the maximum running conditions and lower still than the test conditions). The leak was located outside the Le Havre plant, in an underground part of the pipeline, close to where it runs under a railway line behind the LPG storage and filling centre. The leak was assessed at between 100 and 200 m3.  In total, between 5 August and 11 August 2002, eight defects were found, six of them on the first two kilometres of pipe. Two defects occurred during operation, under similar conditions, near to bends and at changes of direction, yet this pipeline had only run a few dozen hours under operating conditions where the pressure had never exceeded 5 bars in a dilute sulphuric acid environment (concentration less than 15g/l) and at a temperature of under 35\u00b0C (temperature allowed for LFG pipes 50\u00b0C).  As from 11 August 2002, the pipe was shut down for generic failure. Experts were appointed by both the owner and the operator in order to determine the reasons for the failure of the pipe. In November 2002 and January 2003, leak detection tests using a mixture of nitrogen + helium revealed two further leaks.",
        "Causes of the accident": "All of the defects found on the pipe were similar in terms of:- The main direction of fissuring: lengthways in the bottom part of the pipe (lower part of the curve),- Location: close to a singular zone, namely change of gradient or angle (45\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 22\u00b0, 11\u00b0 bends or high point).It was clearly demonstrated that the damage to the pipe was due to a mechanism of stress corrosion in an acid environment. Stress corrosion is a fissuring mechanism that requires a combination of the following three factors:- A stress (or permanent distortion),- A material sensitive to the phenomenon,- A corrosive environment.All of the basic data for the pipeline specification was analysed by experts appointed subsequent to the failures in the pipe. The investigation produced several findings:- Soil / structure interaction As regards the soil, the specification for the pipe required minimum compacting for the bed and sides. Now soil tests made around the pipeline showed compacting values lower than those specified. The pipe thus became more oval in places than the maximum acceptable value.- Hydraulic specification In order to protect the pipeline both from excess pressure (water hammer on start-up) and from negative pressure (pumping stop / start stage), a 20 m3 water hammer protection chamber was installed at the start of the line. To be effective, it was specified that the chamber should be pre-pressurised at 0.5 bar; now on testing following the various incidents, it was found that the chamber had been ore-pressurised at 1.7 bar. The whole of the pipeline thus suffered a more violent pressure drop when pumping stopped (the greatest negative pressure having occurred in the first two kilometres). Similarly, the potential existence of air at high points, because of the absence of vents at the highest points, could have had the same hydraulic consequences, from both excess pressure and negative pressure. - Life of composite pipelines The design curve for the pipeline as regards the risk from stress corrosion supplemented with some experimental values in the field of substantial distortion shows that the burst-time for composite pipelines is a few dozen hours for substantial distortions.The failures occurred near to or at high points and close to a change of direction, which confirms the role of hydraulic transitions. Some failures occurred in a zone where it is difficult to have correct soil compacting (pipeline near to the water table and concrete bore holes). Lastly, most of the failures (6 out of 8) occurred in the first two kilometres, which is the area where hydraulic forces are highest.&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "All soil polluted by the various leaks was treated with sodium carbonate and used as backfill for trenches. Soil investigations undertaken after each of these incidents did not reveal any significant effect on soil or facilities located within the potential impact perimeter of the leaks.\n",
        "Emergency response": "Problems encountered by the plant in operating its new pipe turned out to be far more serious than anticipated and the operator was not anticipating starting the pipe up again before September 2003.As the 13 August 2002 emergency measure order expired on 13 September 2002, the operator asked for it to be extended to December 2002. A further emergency measure order proposed by the DRIRE was signed by the Prefect on 17 September 2002:- It took into account the actual characteristics of the effluent, which resulted in an increase in the flow discharged (maximum average flow over 24 h equal to 14,760 m3/d) and the distance at which the pH is over 5.5 being extended from 50 m to 80 m;- It provided for an investigation into the installation of a new emergency, temporary outfall to discharge into Seine Bay, so as to enable investigations to continue on the pipe between the Le Havre site and Hode without affecting progress on work to redevelop the port.Up to 31 December 2002, the operator thus discharged its effluent into the Seine, via the old outfall (used before the pipe between the Le Havre site and Hode came into operation) partly isolating it from the work to extend the port of the Le Havre. As the new pipe between the Le Havre plant and the Hode neutralisation unit could not be operated again before the end of the 3rd quarter 2003, as an intermediate solution the operator confirmed the building of the new outfall. Various procedures under the regulations lead to temporary approval of:- Firstly the discharge of effluent into the Seine estuary,- Secondly the alteration of the point of discharge into Seine Bay.The operator thus had to stop discharging into Seine Bay up to 2 January 2004 and bring the pipe between the Le Havre plant and the Hode neutralisation unit back into operation.Furthermore, as there had been a number of incidents at the site in a few months, the 21 October 2002 Prefect's emergency measures order specified an audit of its Health, Safety and Environment management system in order to ensure that it was adequate and functioning correctly.Lastly, the Prefect signed an order on 12 December 2002 requiring a review of all hazard surveys relative to the Le Havre site. This was because the last hazard surveys undertaken were specific to certain units and were more than five years old. In view of the various incidents that had occurred at the site, it appeared necessary to take stock of all hazards at the site and not just at some units.Technically speaking, the operator has replaced all leaking pipes. On 22 July 2003, the pipe successfully underwent a further test with water at a pressure of 15 bars maintained for 2 hours. Tests with acidic water were conducted from early August 2003, two other pipes at high points were damaged and have been repaired. In November 2003, the plant was stopped as the acid production unit was being serviced. New trials are scheduled for when acid effluent is available again.Finally, an additional order by the Prefect was made on 8 March 2004. It requires a new transport pipe to be brought into operation before 30 June 2006. It will follow the route of the old pipe and will be made or high density poly-ethylene (HDPE), not LFG.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The lessons to be learned from this series of incidents cover both the technical domain and also the organisational aspect.TechnicallyAlthough the pipes and their assembly complied with the provisions in the regulations as required by the order, which was conformed on 16 July 2002 by a satisfactory resistance test, that the installation of the pipe and pressure control systems were not, however, in accordance with good custom and practice (non-compliance with the specification as regards installing, incorrect sizing of the buffer chamber and under-estimate of the number of vents).On the evidence, the management of project, which involved various parties (internal and external engineering departments, the fabricator of the pipe, civil engineering contractors appointed and their subcontractors, operator), was the cause of several of the faults, in particular, in the systematic pre-checking of calculations, the installation conditions for the pipe and compliance with various rules for pressurising the facility.Financial aspectsThe series of incidents resulted in substantial costs for the operator (business interruption, repairing leaks, changes to the discharge point into Seine Bay, investigations after incidents, repairing the pipe,#). For example, shortening the old outfall and remaking a diffuser cost&nbsp; 329,300 # excluding VAT, and setting up the new discharge point has been estimated at 5,500,000 #. For economic reasons, this work had to be done as temporary replacement of the new pipe between the Le Havre plant and Hode and would never have been undertaken if the new pipe had been operational from the 3rd quarter 2002.Organisational aspectsThe operator's HSE management system required improvements."

        "Accident Description": "The accident took place in a (tank-type) pressurised separator on the synthesis gas line (75% hydrogen and 25% nitrogen at 5\u00b0C) of an ammonia production plant. More precisely, the leak took place at the point of connection between the separator and its level measuring instrument.\nFirst a compressor on the synthesis gas circuit was shut down following a malfunction. When the compressor stopped, there was a slight increase in pressure (25 -> 29 bar) upstream (at the low pressure end). Normal pressure is roughly 25 bar, and the system is protected by a 30 bar pressure relief valve. The pressure of 29 bar, although not too high for the installation, caused the connecting pipe to break on account of heavy wear resulting from undetected corrosion under the insulation. A leak of hydrogen (25 bar) occurred (at roughly 15.30), and caught fire at about 15.45. A flame jet approximately 10 metres high then damaged various surrounding installations (domino effect). Equipment containing oil that became engulfed by the flame jet also caught fire. Although no one was hurt in the accident, the damage caused (solely on the company's premises) was significant, and the plant had to be shut down for several months for repairs. We estimate that roughly 700 kg of hydrogen was released during the leak.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "Corrosion under the lagging of the pipes connecting to the measuring instrument;\nFailure to detect the corrosion.\n",
        "Consequences": "No injuries, no damage outside the site and no environmental impact. Significant damage to equipment near the leak and shutdown of the plant for several months.\n",
        "Emergency response": "The flame jet was extinguished by closing a valve located upstream of the hydrogen leak (once the valve had been closed, the flame jet gradually became smaller and smaller until the hydrogen from the installations between the valve and the leak had burnt off completely as a result of the leak). The company's emergency response team fought the (oil) fire and cooled the equipment near the flame jet so as to minimise damage. The oil fire was brought under control at about 16.10 (the fire began at about 15.45 and the leak at 15.30), which was also the time at which the fire fighters arrived. All that could be done at that point was to wait until the flame jet had stopped burning because there was no more hydrogen and to cool the neighbouring installations (->16.45)\n",

The gasoline vapor generated seemed to ignite during hot work. One mounted gas detector sounded, but it was too late. The cause of the accident seemed to be a construction management error.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Immediate cause: The gasoline vapor generated near No.2 tank circulated around the tank's circumference, and the gas was ignited by a fire source during construction of No.24 tank.\nUnderlying cause: The underlying cause was clearly a management system error. Draw-off work for light hydrocarbons at an adjacent tank was carried out with the manhole open. At the same time, hot work was carried out with a gas detector set up near an adjacent tank. There is a lack of risk management based on the prediction of the generation of gasoline vapor from gasoline draw-off work at an adjacent tank, or the generation of combustible gas from venting gas from another tank and drainage work, etc. There might have been a lack consciousness of the hazard and an insufficient grasp of the details of construction.",
        "Consequences": "Six workers at both tanks were killed, and one person was injured.",
        "Emergency response": "The public fire brigade turned out and the fire was extinguished.",
        "Lesson Learned": "1. It is natural when light hydrocarbons such as gasoline are released into the atmosphere, combustible vapor is generated. This vapor spreads. At the opposite side of the manhole of the tank, the vapor also spreads. This is a basic point to be understood in handling a liquid with a low ignition point such as gasoline. \n2. Safety countermeasures for the construction of hazardous facilities are primarily the responsibility of the owner. Even if the subcontractor is knowledgeable, the owner must have superior knowledge of hazardous substances and the situation in the facilities."

This hydrogen induced cracking has been originated by the geometric form variation and the resulting plastic deformation in the area of (in correspondence of) the damaged longitudinal seam (weld). This incipient cracking was favoured by the high tensile (strength) austenitic CrNiMnW weld metal with its particularly accentuated martensitic composite (mixed) zone (area) along the transition between weld metal and basis metal and was also favoured by its physical characteristics which differ strongly from the basis metal.

Overpressure developed in all parts of the digestion plant because of the sudden, simultaneous failure of the individual systems, e.g. gas injection, feedstock supply, stirrers. The safety devices did not operate due to the power failure, so neither the foam control system nor the foam trap were able to prevent digestate from entering the gas pipeline system. The pipe through which the gas produced is extracted was thus blocked and the devices for relieving overpressure and underpressure were activated.\nThis caused gas to be released into the atmosphere.

        "Causes of the accident": "There was a combination of material failures (the state of the vessel) and failure to apply site procedures strictly.\nState of the vessel: inspectors had required a check of the vessel's thickness. Such a check would have shown a reduction of thickness of one collar and 4/5 of the height of the vessel. However these failures were only noticed after the accident.\nThe reduction in thickness was due to a leak in the lead lining which had allowed the carbon steel, the load-bearing part of the wall, to be corroded.\n",
        "Consequences": "The vessel and the retention basin were destroyed. It is not proposed to reconstruct the vessel: a different one will be used.\nThere were no major effects on the environment: the closure of the valve isolating the site sewers meant that the river was not polluted. Natural phosphate was distributed to neutralise the phosphoric acid, and the resultant compounds were used on site, since they are already in use in the process.\nThe consequences on the subsoil, however, are still under study.\n",
        "Emergency response": "Another container was brought into use and the installations affected were checked and cleaned. The sewer network was pumped out several times, cleaned, and put back into service.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The accident was presented to the teams, and they were reminded of the procedures requiring the comments of the inspection service to be taken into account."

There had been no movement of product on this tank since 02/07/2007, the date filling ended. Tank level records showed abnormal variations since 05/07/2007. The level of the liquid in the tank was 14 m when the roof sinking was detected and a surface area of 3,850 m\u00b2 of crude oil was in direct contact with the ambient air.Hydrocarbon concentration sensors located in the area around the town recorded very high concentrations (from 10,000 to 25,000 \u00b5g/m3) for an average ambient noise of 1,500 \u00b5g/m3.The inspectorate of classified installations recorded the facts. The operator transferred the contents of the tank to the other tanks of the refinery by gravity until the level of the liquid was close to that of the roof, which stabilized at 2.8 m. The tank shell wass then perforated under high pressure and water was injected into the tank so that the hydrocarbons could then be removed by pumping. The operations continued for several weeks to drain off the fluids and sediment at the bottom of the tank.The plan was to repair the tank and bring it back into service by end of August 2009.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Pending the results of ongoing investigations while the tank was emptied and the roof is stabilized and then dismantled, the operator's initial observations leaned towards the scenario of a loss of buoyancy through overload, due to accidental filling of an unsealed buoyancy tank with crude oil and the accumulation of rainwater on the roof.&nbsp; The valve at the bottom of the rainwater draining tank was effectively closed, as hydrocarbon leaks had been detected in the rainwater discharge drain for several months.",

Amongst other things, the cooling/rinsing tank, pumps and numerous pipes, items of process measuring and control equipment and the steel structure were severely damaged by the fire and need to be replaced.\nTimeline of the incident:- At around 8.55 a.m., three employees of a partner company left their place of work near the scene of the subsequent fire and met by a furnace.- The employees of the partner company looked again in the direction of the facility and noticed leaking product and, immediately afterwards, flames.- At the same time, members of site staff were working on the periodic replacement of the bottom withdrawal pump of a column. At 8.58 a.m., a reserve pump was started up. At 8.59 a.m., an alarm on the process control system signalled \u2019pressure low\u2019 on the delivery side of the bottom withdrawal pump.

Shortly after, an emergency shutdown of the plant was implemented.- The plant fire service was dispatched and started extinguishing the fire; back-up was then requested from part-time firefighters.- At 10.17 a.m., the fire was under control and by 10.31 a.m. it had been extinguished.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The pipe connects the delivery sides of the feed pump and the bottom pump with the start-up pipe on the intake side of the top withdrawal pump.\nThe column is filled via the start-up pipe and the pipes are run dry. After the start-up procedure, the pipe remains closed on one side and filled with vacuum distillate (dead end). It is closed at the connection to the delivery side of the feed pump and is subjected to two-phase heating from below by means of steam tracing. The vacuum distillate in the pipe contains approximately 2 per cent by weight sulfur. The pipeline was opened on the delivery side of the bottom pump, where there are fluid temperatures of around 350&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nThe damage to the pipe is due to high-temperature sulfur corrosion. The presence of sulfur and temperatures above 260&nbsp;\u00b0C are necessary for this process.\nThe damaged area is located approximately 30&nbsp;m downstream of the operating path from the bottom pump to a heat exchanger. The following are to be considered very likely causes:\n- H2S introduced by the effect of thermosiphoning.- Leaking gate valve on the cold side (feed pump) causing sulfurous product to enter at &gt;&nbsp;260&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nWhen the reserve pump was started up, there was an increase in pressure, causing a weakened point to rupture.\nPast pipe inspection programmes did not detect any signs of corrosion. The programmes were designed to detect normal signs of corrosion; a gas phase in the upper part of the pipe was not anticipated.\nHigh-temperature sulfur corrosion, through the entry of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (thermosiphon effect) at an operating temperature of approximately 260&nbsp;\u00b0C.",

        "Accident Description": "The event occurred during the summer stop: Atofina establishment stopped the plants on the 5th of August and it should re-start the production on the 2nd of September.All the plants were stopped for maintenance when the event occurred, except for the process of clarification of the Luperox DH in the interested tank.There was one operator in turn, controlling the system from the control room, inspecting the plants cyclically and actuating the necessary operation on the tank process.The operator at 23.20 of the 15th of August 2002, during his control tour, saw a steam leak from the upper valve of the tank and the thermostat joined a temperature over 120\u00b0C, he closed the steam valves of the heating and switched on the external cooling system of the tank. However the thermal decomposition of the 14 tonnes of processing crude began and at 0.40 of the 16th of August 2002 the tank exploded.The event created the total uncovering of the tank, the upper part was thrown on the roof of an electric cabin about 50 meters away.A ball of fire at an height of 100 meters followed the explosion. Some product burned, a part remained inside and the residuary gone nearby. The operator and the fireman of the establishment Solvay Solexis intervened powering the fixed and mobile anti-fire devices; automatically all the cooling systems of the tanks of the storage parc of LPG and benzene were activated due to the temperature rise detected by proper sensors.The national fire brigade of Alessandria visited the plant to check the tanks.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The heating of the tank D269 was with steam at 4 bars: to avoid mass overheating till a temperature near the SADT, the flow was manually interrupted when it joined 45\u00b0C, once the temperature gone down the flow restarted.During the plants stop, the control systems were under retrofitting works, (to transfer to a distributed control system DCS): in the control room, the thermometer for the temperature control of the tank D269 was deactivated, there was a thermocouple on the tank probe joined to a thermometer fixed with bails on the external piping. This has a reading scale till 120\u00b0 without alarm system: the reading must be done in local.The fifth cycle of LUPEROX DH clarification started at 12.30 of the 15th of August with the heating and recirculation phase that had to end at 15.00 with the closing of the two steam manual valves by an operator that began his work at 14.00; the process had to continue with the recirculation. At 20.30 the operator of the 14.00 stopped the recirculation pump; at 22.00 a new operator began working he did the same things of his previous colleague, checking the control room and the plants.The 15th of August 2002 the operator during his controls saw that the upper valve of the tank released some steam and the thermostat arrived at the scale end exceeding 120\u00b0C, he closed the heating steam valve and switched on the external cooling system of the tank. The thermal decomposition of the 14 tonnes of processing crude was proceeded and at 0.40 of the 16th of august 2002 the tank exploded.The establishment individuated as cause of the accident the interruption of the heating steam flow: so the product was accidentally heated at a thermal level exceeding the SADT, creating the decomposition and the runaway.",
        "Consequences": "The event of energetic nature had created the total opening of the upper part of the tank, throwing it on the roof of an electric cabin about 50 metres away, inside the establishment, it resulted partially damaged on the wall structure. Some product burned, some remained in the tank and another gone nearby.The irradiation didn't create nearby burns neither damages to the storage tanks: indeed the opening of the upper part of the tank D269 limited the damage only to this tank.There wasn't toxic clouds or damaged persons.People - Remarks:In Atofina there was only one person during the accident, in Solvay Solexis (Atofina establishment is in the area of Solvay Solexis) there were 60 persons.The emergency staff were composed by two teams of Fire Brigades of Alessandria (10 persons) and 5 emergency operators of Solvay Solexis.&nbsp; ",
        "Emergency response": "The operator and the fireman of the establishment of Solvay Solexis intervened switching on the fixed and mobile fire prevention devices, all the cooling systems of the tanks of the storage park of LPG and benzene activated due to the temperature rise detected by the proper sensors.The national fire brigade visited the plant to check the tanks mentioned above.In the afternoon of the 16th of August 2002 the department of ARPA of Alessandria took two champions of air, they analysed it with a gas chromatography and a mass spectrometry, any organic compounds was present. Environmental impacts were excluded after the monitoring of other matrices.Official action taken - legal action: There isn't a judgemental procedure.Official action taken - other official action: The technological risk unit og ARPA Piemonte (Regional Environmental Protection Agency) with the department of ARPA Alessandria have visited the establishment on the 16th of August 2002, on 20 of Agust they came back with the Civil Protection of Alessandria. The department of ARPA Alessandria have monitored the environment to exclude any impact on the interested environmental matrices. The technical risk unit have written a technical report concerning the event, sending it on the 21st of August 2002 to the Prefect of Alessandria, to the Piemonte Region, to the Province and Municipality of Alessandria.The provincial chief of Fire Brigades of Alessandria prepared a report concerning the accident, sending it on the 9th of September 2002 to the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Environment and Land Protection, the Prefect and Municipality of Alessandria, the Regional Inspectorate of Fire Brigade of Piemonte, the Piemonte Region and ARPA Piemonte.The Prefect of Alessandria with note of the 17th of August 2002 predisposed a technical and structural verification on the plant, to verify the safety before the restart of the activity and to warranty the continuous presence of the technical personnel during 24 hours in case of emergency.On the 21st of August and the 4th of September 2002, the establishment have sent some notes in answer to the requests of the Prefect of Alessandria.The Prefect of Alessandria with note of the 6th of September 2002 has requested to the establishment more information regarding the accident (ex: only one operator at work......). The establishment has answered on the 10th of September 2002.On the 12 of September 2002, the Regional Technical Committee of Piemonte has examined the accident, as asked by the Prefect of Alessandria and the local administration. During the meeting the Regional Technical Committee has individuated some urgent management measures to control the accident risks, to restart the activity they have asked the establishment to give documentation certifying the actuation of the prescriptions.On the 20 of September 2002 the establishment has sent the requested documentation.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate Lessons: In the afternoon of the 16th of August the establishment provides the safety shut down of the tank D269, retrieving about 5 tonnes of liquid that remained on the bottom at the end of the emergency.The tank is unusable and the clarification of the LUPEROX DH is suspended.The establishment is predisposing a study based on the clarification process in vacuum with an equipment at a less hold-up and automatic control systems, as the actual plant process is inadequate.Measures to prevent recurrence: The LUPEROX DH process has been suspended, the establishment is predisposing a study based on the clarification process in vacuum with an equipment at a less hold-up and authomatic and repetitive control systems, as the actual plant process in inadequate.As concerns to the organic peroxides instability and reactivity, the establishment adopted proper managerial measures to reduce the risks of the processes, as requested on the prescription of the Regional Technical Committee and in the verification of the SMS.

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nA technician had tested a dryer on a number of occasions. He closed the man-hole cover, put the dryer under vacuum and started rotation. A few minutes later, an explosion occurred. No one was injured. Investigations revealed that after the last testing the dryer man-hole cover was not fully fastened. Air must have entered the rotating dryer at the man-hole cover gasket after sampling. The ignition source was probably by an electrostatic discharge. No nitrogen inerting was used.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nThe investigations revealed that, after the last testing, the dryer man-hole cover was not fully fastened. Air must have entered the rotating dryer at the man-hole cover gasket after sampling. It was known that the powders being dried could explode, some residual acetone vapours were present and the Teflon coating on the internal lining of the dryer could have built up a charge. Thus an electrostatic discharge may have caused the explosion. Nitrogen inerting was not used (and due to a lack in safety culture (code 5302) and insufficient operational procedures (code 5303), an explosive mixture formed).\n",
        "Consequences": "In the Original Report there is no evidence of damages due to the dust explosion.People - Remarks: Nobody was injured by the explosion.Affected Area: installation",

        "Finish Date": "1994-07-06 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Five tonnes of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) were inadvertently discharged into a vent system when a shipping operator left a vent valve open after clearing a vapour lock from a VCM off-loading pump. Approximately 3 tonnes of this were released at the base of the plant vent stack because a mild steel section of vent line had corroded and been temporarily repaired and failed again. The replacement pipe had been ordered but not fitted despite the outstanding working being held in the computerised maintenance system. Design of off-loading and vent system. Material of construction of VC vent line. Management of outstanding maintenance work/temporary repairs. HMIP informed and Enforcement Notice received. HSE informed.\nThis was an extremely serious loss of containment which could have led to more serious consequences. It occurred because of a number of shortcomings in the plant design, in the procedures used to operate plant and rectify deficiencies, and in the performance of people. The lessons from this incident have been learned by all personnel involved and the actions are being followed up with urgency. Thanks to the alertness and to the actions of the emergency response team the emission of VCM dispersed safely without adverse effect.Unloading of VC from road tankers unusual - no more than twice per year. Leak of steam through control valve for snuffing valve at the top of the vent stack which allowed condensate to run down inside of the stack and accumulate at the bottom. The gases from the main plant vent contained hydrogen chloride resulting in accumulation of acidic solution. Estimated rate of corrosion due to HCL to be about 2 mm per week. Sequence of events:- 13/5- lower section of vent pipe replaced due to corrosion, 18/5 drain valve found to be blocked, 19/5 valve cleared by water jetting, 20/5 next adjacent section of vent pipe replaced due to corrosion, 25/5 pin hole leak in lower section of pipe which had been clipped, 26/5 decided to replace pipe with acid resistant pipe, 27/5 stack draining procedure revised, 27/6 started maintenance shut down. Steam control valve scheduled to be replaced, 6/7 release of VC.",
        "Causes of the accident": "There were root causes which enabled this incident to occur. - Firstly, the design of the VCM off-loading system does not prevent the vapour locking of the off-loading pump.&nbsp;\nVCM import is an infrequent occurrence and technical evaluation work was underway several hours before the incident to identify suitable instrumentation for this duty. - Secondly the design of the vent system at the Shipping bay does not prevent the operator error that occurred or indicate that an error has been made. - Thirdly the procedure for managing known defects and temporary repairs was not sufficiently rigorous for SHE critical jobs.Also Operator wrongly left vent valve open after clearing vapour lock in transfer pump. Corrosion at base of stack temporarily repaired. Wrong part supplied. Very rapid corrosion led to failure again. No system to check adequacy of extending temporary repair.",
        "Consequences": "not givenAffected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "not givenOfficial action taken - other official action: Overlap of enforcement responsibility. Notice action taken by HM Inspector of Pollution (see doc 6). Separate follow up visit by HSE to check actions on health and safety issues. Letter sent and a further visit planned.Discussion about response: An outline of this incident can be seen in document 7 which outlines the company's version of the history of this occurrence. Appendix 1 of this document gives a history and cause of the corrosion problem at the base of the vent stack.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: 1) Company should ensure that there is a written operating procedure before starting infrequent/unusual operations.2) Detector to be installed to prevent vapour entering pump.3) Reduce/avoid liquid down vent line by fitting a restrictor orifice and a knockout drum in the line, with a high level alarm to the control room.4) System for dealing with temporary repairs to be improved;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - new site wide procedures&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - new computer tracking system to track safety related work and temporary repairs.5) Vent stack drain valve and draining procedures modified so that operator can see whether valve blocked.Measures to mitigate consequences: Incident handled well, although ICI are reviewing the number and location of flammable gas detectors required."

        "Accident Description": "A series of explosions occurred in a catalytic reforming plant of the refinery, followed by a fire in the same unit.\nThe establishment is classified as Seveso Upper Class. The accident is classified as level 4 on the international accident gravity scale.\n\nConsidering the material damage, which was high, the criterion in Annex VI is exceeded: the accident has to be notified to the European database (MARS).The accident:A fire associated with muffled explosions started in the refinery at 21:15, involving the desulphurising section of the \"crackert No. 7\". The fire continued until 15:12 of 4 September. The accident chronology was as follows:* 21:12: rupture of a 3/4 inch tapping (connection) on the suction pipe of pump P3B,* 21:12 + 30 s: ignition of the cloud (about 200 kg of the substance) and creation of a (combustible) fed torch fire ,*21:13: rupture of a 3-inch mineral oil pipe which was exposed to the torch fire,&nbsp; creating another fire jet of larger size,*21:18: by domino effect,&nbsp; rupture of the collector of a cooling tower and ignition of the released substance,* 21:22: - by domino effect effect, rupture of the&nbsp; 8-inch head pipe&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; column V3, ignition of the release,&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - by domino effect, rupture of column V3 valves collector, which is connected to the site's flare system, and ignition of the released gas. This caused a partial release to the atmosphere&nbsp; from the site's flare system.* From 22:00 onwards: The ignited releases kept on burning until the material being processed in the unit was exhausted and the flare system could be isolated without risk, an operation which was completed on 4 September at 15:15 hrs.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The causes of the accident are related to a system constituted of \"steam turbine + pump\" (Ref. P3B). Actually, the accident occurred during a periodical test phase carried out with this equipment, which constitutes an emergency relief unit for the P3A pump.Various investigations carried out after the accident, have led to the identification of a complex of factors which may have caused the accident itself. The causes which may have brought about the accident according to the various reports issued on this subject are collected below:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Presence of condensates in the turbine (closed bleeder valve),.....* Inadequate anchoring of the frame to the foundation,.....* Inadequate lubrication of the pump's bearing assembly,.....* Design of the pump rotor,.....* Cavitation phenomena of the pump, the aspiration capacity being inadequate,.....* Anomalies in the bearings' refrigeration system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These factors caused:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - strong vibrations of the pump, which caused&nbsp; fatigue stressing and consequently the rupture of a 3/4 inch tapping&nbsp; (connection) placed just above the pump,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - a misalignment of the turbine and the pump, which caused a fracture of the shaft and a deterioration of the coupling.An event&nbsp; which contributed to the gravity of the accident was identified. An anomalous delay (of about 10 min) in the closing of the block valve of the feeding pipe of the P3B pump. Actually, if the closing of this valve, which was controlled by the automatic safety system, had been completed within the normal time (of about one minute), the domino effects which involved the other pipe networks could have been avoided, substantially reducing the gravity of the accident.",
        "Consequences": "The accident caused minor injuries to one person.There was no significant environmental impact, and the extinguishing water has been stored in a 60.000 m3 buffer tank designed this purpose.The accident has caused a 7-month shutdown of the unit. The material damage amounts to about 13.72 Meuros (13.720.000 euros) for repairs and 68.6 Meuros (68.600.000 euros) for production loss.",
        "Emergency response": "The emergency response operations in this accident were carried out by the on-site fire fighting service of the refinery, supported by the neighbouring city's fire brigade.The fire fighting strategy was based on reducing the risk of fire propagation and cooling the structures which were exposed to thermal radiation, in order to prevent a possible collapse. However, at the climax of the fire large water delivery rates were employed (of the order of 2300 m3/h, with a pressure of 7 to 8 bar, supplied by the extinguishing system of the installation).Following the accident, an decree for urgent measures has been issued by the Departement's prefect, on 4 September 2000, requiring the operator to:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; provide a list of the equipment affected by the accident,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; provide an accident report including a report on measures for preventing recurrence of similar accidents,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; provide a report on the operational status of the equipment .The same decree states also that the start-up of the installations involved in the accident has to be authorised by the regional prefect. During the discussions which followed, the following requirements emerged:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * evaluation of the operator's accident report by a third-party expert,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * implementation of a systematic and methodical inspection program, in order to assess the state of the equipment.After an examination of the neighbouring installations, the operator declared that only the \"No. 7 cracking\" unit had been significantly affected.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following method has been chosen to assess the state of the equipment involved:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * As a first step, a (methodical and systematic) inspection plan has been prepared. This inspection plan has been approved by the expert who in this context was employed also by the insurance companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * This inspection plan has been implemented for the totality of the equipment which may have been affected by the accident;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The implementation of this inspection plan has made it possible to prepare a&nbsp; classification of the equipment according to its operability.Taking in&nbsp; consideration the elements mentioned above, the inspectorate has recorded the classification, as submitted by mail, which was obtained by each piece of equipment after implementation of this inspection plan; the inspectorate also reminded the operator that the various construction and repair operations involving the equipment must be carried out in compliance of the rules of good practice and while strictly complying with the relevant regulations.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The following corrective measures have been proposed by the operator: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Change of pump type and modification of the vertical alignement of the column, in order to avoid cavitation phenomena;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Replacement of the motor-driven valves placed in the pipes feeding the P3A and P3B pumps, in order to reduce the shutting delay, the declared objective of Total being a shut-off delay below 30s;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Modification of the turbine's speed regulation system into an \"isochronous\" regulation system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Replacement of the 3/4 inch tapping (connection)&nbsp; of the involved pumps by 1 inch tapping&nbsp; (connection), provided with reinforcement gussets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Modification of the drainage system of the turbines involved;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Implementation of a campaign aiming to increase worker's awareness of the importance of a strict application of operating procedures during the heat-up phase of turbines.These proposals were approved by the third-party expert, who has independently prepared some additional recommendations.With reference to these different expert assessments, the Departement's prefect has authorised the new start-up of the unit, the authorisation being subject to the condition of the operator's compliance with additional requirements (complementary decree of 27 March 2001)."

        "Accident Description": "On 2 July, at 12:16, on the Petromidia platform, at the Hydrofining Plant (HPM) was an explosion followed by a fire. Based on the analysis of the accident it was found that during the technological process, a pump feeding the reaction section in tank 122-V8 failed. Following the shutdown of this pump, a series of other events occured which led to the explosion followed by fire of tank 122-V8, as described: - after the pump stopped, the flow in the system dropped and the sense valve cracked; - the non functioning of the sense valve led to the increase in pressure in the tank 122-V8; the pressure in the reactor reversed the technological flow and led to the supply of the tank, 122-V8 with mixture of diesel and hydrogen; - a series of communication alarms followed at the lower level transducer from the 122-V8 tank continuing with maximum level alarm to the 122-V8 vessel; - the following alarms are from the pressure in the tank that first signals maximum, followed in the same second by a minimum alarm (at this moment the explosion has already taken place). As a result of the explosion there were three fires in three directions: one at the exploding tank, one at a cracked pipe in the gas fractionation area and one on the ground in the tank area.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Loss of physico-chemical qualities of installations, fittings, pipes. Failure of the pump that ensures the transfer of synthesis gas for mixing with diesel oil in the process of its hydrorefining, as well as the failure of its sense valve. In addition, the second back-up pump was under repair.",
        "Consequences": "The consequences of the event were the following: - Destruction to the installations: the HPM facility in proportion to 50%, the HPR facility in proportion to 10% and the R.C. facility in proportion to 10%. - Victims: 1 victim with burns on approximately 45% of the body surface; 1 victim with burns on approximately 35% of the body surface; 1 victim with lumbar trauma; 1 victim with facial trauma; 1 victim with minor trauma assisted on the spot; 1 deceased person. The accident was local and not beyond the boundaries of the site.",
        "Emergency response": "As a first intervention before the arrival of the professional emergency service, the private service service intervened with 2 water and foam extinguishing vehicles and 1 ambulance. They carried out a reconnaissance of the area in conjunction with the supervisor on site, cut the electricity supply to the whole section and took the first steps to extinguish the fire.  Access to the area has been restricted and the safety zone (300 meters) has been delimited and access routes have been established to facilitate the access of external intervention forces.  Air quality monitoring in the vicinity of the site with an accredited laboratory was requested. Personnel who were not involved in the intervention were evacuated. Following the activation of the Red Intervention Plan, the professional emergency service were alerted and directed to the scene of the accident. In addition to the forces from Constanta county, reinforcements were requested from other 6 neighboring counties, acting on the spot with the following means of intervention: fire engines, ambulances, 1 helicopter for medical assistance, 1 CBRN.  The fire was extinguished at 15:00. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "A thorough HAZOP analysis of the installation is recommended.\nRedundancy of safety measures to prevent risks from occurring.\nThe requirement for a minimum of two functional pumps to ensure the flow.\nIt is important that the overpressure valve of the vessel that exploded be sized in relation to the pressure recorded in the event of a similar accident.\nIt is recommended that after each intervention an analysis is made and corrective measures are taken.\nThe need to update the safety report."

        "Accident Description": "On 28&nbsp;July&nbsp;2015, there was a temperature increase in a storage tank.At the time of the incident, the tank contained two batches of acrylamide solution (40&nbsp;% acrylamide) and was 70&nbsp;% full.The on-site fire service added 1000&nbsp;kg of 6&nbsp;% copper sulphate solution and 22&nbsp;m3 of water.In order to mix in these two added components, a pump was then used to try and circulate the contents of the tank. Furthermore, the compressed air added via the nozzle ring installed at the base of the tank was increased to over 3&nbsp;m3/h.\nThese measures guaranteed specific maximum temperatures throughout the entire incident.In the lower and middle parts of the tank, the acrylamide solution remained in a liquid state, while in the upper part, for the most part a solid polymer developed.\nIn the following weeks, the tank was drained.Having removed approximately 54&nbsp;t, a circular opening (600&nbsp;mm in diameter) had to be cut in the wall of the tank, above the level of the liquid, in order to continue pumping out the contents of the tank.Once the tank was empty, the inside of the tank and the pipes linked to the tank were cleaned by a specialist firm.Following laboratory testing, the polymer that had developed was transferred to a waste disposal facility and disposed of.An inspection of the inside of the tank by the operator found absolutely no abnormalities.The cut-out circular opening was welded, smoothed and passivated by a specialist firm.On 9&nbsp;September&nbsp;2015, an extraordinary inspection was carried out by an expert. No defects whatsoever were found, and there were no concerns regarding continued use.\nSafety function:Addition of copper sulphate solution (stabilising agent) to the storage tank.",
        "Causes of the accident": "During dismantling / inspection of the pump by a specialist company, polymerisate was detected in the gap area of the magnetic pot.This polymer could have had an initiating effect for a subsequent tank polymerisation and have its cause in an inadequate liquid filling of this pump region. This, in turn, may have been created in advance by a gas-pulling inlet vortex to the pump during emptying with a low filling level of the tank.In the future, such a phenomenon is avoided by raising the minimum levels in the storage tanks.",

Initially, a strong whistle from this tank had been noticed but it was supposed to be a steam leak. Repair of the steam duct had been organized. The operators sent on the top of the tank for the repair works noticed a cloud with a yellow-green colour escaping from the tank and gave the alarm. A large fire developped and a strong explosion occurred 6 or 7 minutes after the whistle was noticed. Combustion products of cyclohexanone and dimethoate together with the toxic substances from the insulating and plastic materials of the nearby pipings, structures and plants involved in the fire were released into the environment. Due to the explosion, the front bottom part of the tank was thrown towards the Rogor plant and the remaining part, as a missile, against the reinforced concrete wall of the control room about 45 m away. The fire that followed the explosion had been extinguished by water-sprays in about 20 minutes with the intervention of the plant firemen and the National Fire Brigade. Although most of the water used in fire fighting operations had been contained within the tanks dikes (after the interception of the sewer network and by means of dedicated pumps), a certain part of it flowed into the nearby Lavello channel and then in the sea. Prohibition of bathing followed. The degree of pollution of the air, soil and water due to the release of toxic substances and combustion products as well as the fire extinguishing water were continuously controlled (the results of these checks are shown in a document attached to the Original Report). People was warned to careful wash fruits and vegetables before to eat them and to follow the normal rules of personal hygiene.\nWhen the Original Report was prepared (27/08/1988) the type of danger was still present because traces of Rogor have been found in some samples taken in the discharge water from FARMOPLANT and in the Lavello torrent.

        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSE:When the Original Report the causes were still under investigation, but at least two hypotheses may be advanced for this accident:1- being known that Rogor contained in the tank was out of specification, secondary exothermic reactions could have occurred resulting in the overpressurization of the tank up to its failure and causing the release of Rogor and cyclohexanone. Ignition of cyclohexanone vapours due to the exothermic reactions might have caused the following fire and the explosion.2- operational error that could have caused the overpressurization or tank failure (leakage) resulting in the release of Rogor and cyclohexanone. Ignition of cyclohexanone vapours due to unknown causes may have caused the following fire and the explosion.Both cases resulted in tank failure (code 5101) and liquid release.",

        "Causes of the accident": "The release of the orthodichlorobenzene (ODCB) was caused by broken cover screws on a manual valve in the ODCB cold system due to chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking.The local concentration of the damage is due to the partially restricted, critical corrosion conditions resulting from high local chloride contamination and a low pH value (TDI residue dust, sea air containing chloride, nearby hydrochloric acid electrolysis plant) in connection with prolonged humidification (rainwater, cleaning water and temperature of the ODCB cold system), which prevents rapid drying.\nAccording to the above description of the causes, both the operating conditions and the environmental conditions were responsible for causing the incident.",
        "Consequences": "Manual valve, waste ODCB",
        "Emergency response": "- The production plant was shut down to make it safe.- As a precaution, the plant fire service was deployed to precipitate any liquid aerosol.As a precaution, a warning was issued in the areas downwind from the leak (own production areas and neighbouring companies).- A D1 signal was transmitted to the district control centre.- An air pollution measuring vehicle was deployed at the plant boundary downwind from the leak.- The leaked ODCB was pumped into the special emergency tank.\nThe manual valve was replaced, as was the ODCB which had leaked out.Members of the plant fire service and plant staff who had replaced the manual valve were decontaminated in the basin.A pipe section with traces of the ODCB was rinsed and the rinse water was disposed of in the biological waste water treatment plant.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nInstallation of a filter at the point of discharge of the TDI residue to minimise possible chloride contamination through TDI residue dust.\n\n\nReplacement of (similar) cover screws on all valves of the ODCB cold system.Using screws made of a different material was considered but deliberately ruled out, since, on the one hand, there is a high potential for corrosion on contact with the higher-alloy casing material when screws made of non-alloy and low-alloy material are used and, on the other, there is a high risk of confusion during maintenance when higher-alloy materials are used, in particular in the case of standard components such as screws, due to their very similar appearance.\n\n\nProper functioning of the cover screws will in future be ensured by periodically inspecting the screws on the valves of the ODCB cold system in the relevant part of the plant, in accordance with an inspection schedule agreed with the authority.The nature and scope of the inspection programme will be periodically assessed in close coordination with the authority on the basis of the results obtained, and will be improved if necessary.\n\n\nIn other areas of the TDI plant, a representative sample of valves of the same design, distributed over the entire system, was selected to identify any damage to cover screws.\n\n\nA representative sample of valves of the same design, distributed over the entire system, was selected to identify any damage to flange screws.\n\n\nFurthermore, the company group instigated an inspection of cover screws on selected valves in other establishments on the site and in other TDI plants worldwide.\n\n\nThe operator was also kept informed of the examination of the case, the causes identified of the damage and the corrective measures taken.\n\nIn the present case, the consequences were limited to the basin and no additional measures were necessary."

        "Finish Date": "2004-05-10 08:20:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident happened when a welding electrode was going to be welded on to a broken bolt in a wooden frame to a mould to allow it to be raised in order to fit a lifting eye so that the mould could be lifted out of the hole in the topside of a torpedo car. A torpedo car is a long tube dressed with castings and ceramic bricks and is used to transport liquid pig iron from the blast furnace to the steelworks.The torpedo car had just been reconditioned with new castings and bricks (The torpedo car is normally reconditioned twice a year). During the hardening process, hydrogen gas was emitted inside the closed and tight torpedo car and an explosive mixture was formed inside the torpedo car. When the welding electrode came into contact with the bolt in the wooden frame the hydrogen gas mixture exploded. The welding procedure was not an ordinary job but was needed because the bolt was broken.One person, who was standing on the lid of the casting mould, was thrown into the air and fell down. He died from the injuries he sustained. The person doing the welding was hit in the jaw by the lid. He received treatment at University Hospital Ume\u00e5 for severe facial injuries. Two other persons, who were placed near the spot of the accident, received minor injuries.",
        "Causes of the accident": "An unintentional explosive atmosphere had been formed in the torpedo car. The hydrogen gas was enclosed because of the construction of the mould and the underlying covering plastics.During the attempt to repair the lifting eye bolt (by welding) the hydrogen gas mixture ignited and exploded.The investigation is still ongoing; the results of which will be detailed in a full report. \nThe accident happened because of a lack of information from the supplier to the user. Even if the suppler is formally not obliged to do so, the supplier should have informed the company that hydrogen gas would be formed during the hardening process of the cast compound.&nbsp; The purpose of a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) is to inform about all possible hazardous risks of the product within its field of application.&nbsp; ",
        "Consequences": "Area concerned - Remarks:The accident caused only damages in a limited area in the ceramics and masonry yard. People - Remarks:One person was killed and one sustained severe facial injuries. Two people sustained minor injuries and were able to leave hospital on the following day.Discussion about the consequences:If the company had been conscious of the formation of hydrogen gas during the hardening process there would probably not have been an accident and consequently no damage or injuries or fatalitiesThis tragic accident led to no consequences outside the plant.",
        "Emergency response": "Initial response: personnel on site trained in first-aid. External responses: emergency medical treatment on scene by ambulance personnel and fire &amp; rescue service personnel. Casualties were transported to the hospital for further treatment. The company itself ordered all work in the ceramics and masonry yard to cease. At the time of the accident there were several persons in the neigbourhood.&nbsp; The emergency call was first received by the internal&nbsp; industrial guard office who thereafter called the national emergency center (SOS Alarm). SOS Alarm interpreted&nbsp; the call as an emission of gas and called out the fire service first.First aid was performed by workmates. However, the ambulance was in the neigbourhood and arrived on scene in about 15 minutes. One person died and one person was brought to hospital and operated on for serious facial injuries. Two other persons were sent to hospital due to minor injuries.Other workmates were assembled for a debriefing. Seveso II Duties:At the visit to the company the 24th of September 2004, the company stated that it had a term of contract with the supplier that they should supply the company with all cast compound and that the supplier owns all the casting in the torpedo car and that the company pay for the amount (kg) of pig iron that is transported in the torpedo car.The supplier had not in the safety data sheet informed that hydrogen gas is formed during the hardening process of the cast compound. They had not informed that the cast compound should not be used in enclosed spaces due to the formation of hydrogen gas.The company had internal regulations concerning \"hot works\" like welding. In this case the regulations were not applicable because of a lack of knowledge that hydrogen gas was formed during the hardening process. When there are special conditions the foreman must perform a risk assessment before welding (or other hot works)&nbsp; and after taking necessary measures give permission to act. In this case there was no special condition as welding is generally permitted in the ceramics and masonry yard.Official Action Taken - legal action:On 10th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority immediately prohibited further maintenance work with the torpedo car. The terms to remove the prohibition were that the company should &nbsp;&nbsp; - carry out an investigation on the causes of the accident ,&nbsp;&nbsp; - perform a risk assessment and &nbsp;&nbsp; - remove the risks On 11th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority pronounced under penalty of a fine prohibition for the company to go on with repair work with the torpedo cars unless the following terms were fulfilled:&nbsp; 1. Risk assessment concerning occupational risks with chemical substances.&nbsp; 2. Risk assessment concerning work in a place where there is a risk of an explosive atmosphere.&nbsp; On 18th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority changed the terms of prohibition from the 11th of May. In order to remove the prohibition the new terms were that the torpedo cars should be vented during repair and maintenance work.On 8th June 2004 the company informed the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority about a completed risk assessment. As can be seen from the risk assessment the risk of explosive atmospheres in the working place had been removed. The company also informed that it had exchanged the casting compound for the compound they used earlier and not the compound that was involved in the accident. On 9th June the the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority removed the earlier prohibition.Official Action Taken - other action:The company was reported to be legally prosecuted for the accident but the investigation was removed from the cause list. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:- The closed casting mould is replaced with an open one.- Exchange of cast compound for the compound they used earlier.- The torpedo car will be ventilated during casting cycle.- A risk assessment concerning the casting cycle had been performed - One person has been appointed as full time safety controller at the ceramics and masonry yard.- The company to perform risk assessments of every working aspect and, if necessary, change materials or routines.- Improve the routines of reporting accidents and incidents.Measures to mitigate consequences:see above"

        "Accident Description": "ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:\nThe wind directed the gas cloud produced by the fire towards Tavaux.\n\nACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nDuring a weekly test programme, at 11:30 two maintenance operators started to test the isolation valves and the space piston pump. At about 11:50 this spare pump was switched-on and, immediately after, a leakage from a piping located above the operators occurred. They quickly escaped towards the control room before the gas was ignited by the pyrolysis furnace. The Internal Emergency Plan was activated. The unit was shut-down and fire protection means were activated while the affected area was evacuated. The fire was not extinguished to avoid formation of an explosive gas cloud; at the same time the protection of structures exposed to intense heat radiation using cooling via fixed monitors and of the pyrolysis furnace by means of a fixed water curtain was necessary. Isolation valves around the unit on fire were closed to reduce the amount of flammable substances potentially involved. However, one of the isolation valves could not be completely closed (because the accident occurred during a test) and therefore the duration of the fire was prolonged. After 10 minutes other pipes were ruptured causing an escalation of the fire, which was finally extinguished after 13 hours (at about 00:45). Damages to the plant were confined to an area of 20-25m radius on a platform at an elevation of 6m. A nearby school was evacuated when a hydrogen chloride concentration of 10-15ppm was measured in the vicinity. Hydrogen chloride concentrations measured indicate that confinment should have been preferred versus the evacuation. Ambient air monitoring performed by the local mobile chemical emergency intervention unit could detect only traces of toxic gases. Used fire fighting water was collected for treatment at the waste-water treatment facilities of the plant. Water quality measurements in samples taken from the waste-water discharge channel and the river revealed no pollution.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nThe piping rupture has been attributed to internal erosion caused by the abrasive action due to the solid particles (4-6 g/l coal particulate) contained in the circulating fluid. Besides, further studies confirmed that the installation of a diaphragm with an opening smaller than originally planned (in order to obtain a more accurate measure of the liquid flow) aggravated the erosion (the diameter reduction of the diaphragm from 192mm to 132mm caused an increase of the liquid speed of a factor of 2.1 and of the turbulence effects of a factor of 4.5). In effects, the piping, in a zone downstream 10-60cm the diaphragm, showed a higher erosion than in the other section and therefore, when the spare pump was switched-on, the liquid flow was sufficient to rupture the pipe.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 1 person was hospitalized by psychological shock due to the flash fire. Outside the establishment 1 person (a 14 years girl) was hospitalized and 10 pupils of a nearby school were examined by personnel of the hospital of Dole.MATERIAL LOSS:During the first phase of the fire (before to put in service the protection means), heat radiation damaged the majority of the devices made with not resistant materials (cables, measurement instruments, shields and cable channel) in a radius of 20-25 metres on a platform at an elevation of&nbsp; 6 meters.&nbsp; Within this zone there has been also the deformation of some structures and the rupture of 12 pipes. No data are available about the cost of the material damages.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The population has been advised to stay indoors. Traffic in the national high-way No 73 and other roads of minor importance around the site were interrupted. These precautionary measures were taken up to 16:15.&nbsp; SOLVAY personnel performed toxic gas measurements near the school C.E.S. in the city of Tavaux. Concentrations of about 10-15ppm of hydrogen chloride were measured and the school (50 pupils) was evacuated towards a school in Dole. The fire was extinguished by the plant fire brigade (58 people).Ecological harm - Remarks: Ambient air monitoring performed by the local mobile chemical emergency intervention unit could detect only traces of toxic gases.

        "Accident Description": "The accident took place on 24/05/2011 around 1:30 in the transhipment hall. Workers were busy loading a truck trailer via a loading kay. The first pallet on which was a 170 kg drum with piperidine was placed on the bottom of the trailer: the drum was placed on a pallet, a second pallet was placed vertically behind the barrel, the whole was wrapped together to immobilize the drum on the pallet. The worker had to place the next pallet with a forklift in front of the pallet on which stood the drum with piperidine. The forks of the forklift pierced the drum with piperidine at a height of 40 cm (55 cm above the floor level of the trailer). The storekeeper warned his colleague who entered the trailer and found the leak and a strong odor.\u00a0",
        "Causes of the accident": "When loading the truck, the storekeeper moved with his forklift with the forks positioned about 55 cm above ground level. Since the truck was positioned at a loading kay which allowed level acces there was no need to raise the forks for this opertation.He therefore did not comply with the safety rule for mobile vehicles that says to \"run empty and loaded with forks 15 cm from the ground.\" This rule, however, is well reflected in the warehouse manual that he should have received and signed to confrim he took knowledge of it.The warehouse worker was a temporary worker. He had been directly employed to the post of storekeeper in the night shift (17:00- 1:30). It was also his first day of work on the site. In addition, the colleague was not an experienced worker, he was also a new worker, in function only for a month and a half as storekeeper.",
        "Consequences": "Loss of containment of just over 100 kg of piperidine, flammable and toxic by inhalation and contact: leak contained and removed by dilution and removal of the mixture and absorption with sand. Seven workers were hospitalized preventively for 36 h, they remained under observation because there is a risk of developing pulmonary oedema with this substance. Finally, there is no lesion seen for these seven people.These workers were:- the 2 operators loading the truck who were exposed when the drum was pierced.- 3 people of the internal intervention team who explored the situation whithout resperatory protection - 2 people who were in the neighbourhoodEvacuation of the whole site and a security perimeter was set up by police around the site.",
        "Emergency response": "Orally, the team leaders evacuated the transhipment hall. A team leader entered the trailer of the truck to check the damage. The team leaders then fitted mask cartridges and boots in order to intervene in the truck.\u00a0These internal intervention team entered the truck, placed the damaged drum in a oversized drum, took it out of the truck and scattered sand on the spill in the truck. The oversized drum was closed and placed at the entrance hall outside. Some of the liquid was found in the drain beneath the loading docks, the drain is connected to the retention basin.The prevention advisor then arrived on the spot. The intervention team proceeded then to the identification of the product in the drum: it was a drum in transit (arrived on 23/05/2011, stored temporarily in the hall and departure on 24/05/2011), the only information available on the product was those listed on the CMR (but the CMR was not directly available) and on the label on the drum itself. The product name, piperidine, was then spotted on the barrel itself. The prevention advisor then searched the MSDS in the computer system via a computer in the administrative office of the transhipment hall, but without success and then via internet, but without success also because Internet access was not possible . He then went into the main administrative offices located at the other end of the site. He returned with the MSDS of the product found on the Internet.In consultation with the internal intervention team, it was decided not to continue the intervention (dilution and removal of the remaining product with water to the fire retention pond), but to call to the external fire departement.A security perimeter was internally created (notably to prevent truck access to the site).The prevention advisor welcomed the firefighters and provided the link with the emergency services. Firefighters then established their command post.The chemical intervention cell was deployed by the fire departement and an intervention strategy was put in place: two firemen equipped with chemical proof overalls and breathing apparatus was then sent into the truck in reconnaissance, before setting up the actual response : cleaning the truck, rinsing and dilution.A security perimeter was set up by police around the site during these operations.It remained necessary to remove the diluted product that was collected in the retention pond: there was a consultation with the client\u00a0on residual risks of the product diluted with water and finally a test was performed on a sample of the mixture water + product to determine if the mixture was still flammable. As this was not the case, the mixture could be pumped into a tanker truck and then be removed.",
        "Lesson Learned": "More consistent formation of temporary workersNo more temporary workers put the first day to work during night shiftsBetter access on safety information about the products in transit: all goods in transit warehouses are not accompanied by an MSDS. Only security Tremcards are available. These include very general safety instructions and not always accompany the goods (Tremcards are stored in the cabin of the vehicle). This finding is similar for all goods in transit through the territory. Therefore, in case of intervention, research on the internet (very common product in this case) of the MSDS seems like a good solution.More consistant training module for all the staff presenting the hazards of chemicals and including a detailed explanation of personal protective equipment needed in case of intervention and an explanation of the methods of dressing upMore specific training module for intervention crew, including detailed explanation of the MSDS and consultation of MSDS via the stock program and detailed explanations of response procedures"

        "Accident Description": "On 27 May 2011 a fire was caused at a polyol plant by phthalic anhydride leaking from a flange. The plant produces surfactants. The fire was extinguished by the on-site fire brigade in approx. 5 minutes. The water used by the brigade was collected in a tank. The substance leaked out in a region above a secured area of the plant. The area is surrounded by a gutter so no unsecured areas were affected. Phthalic anhydride (85-44-9) is solid at ambient temperature and is kept in a liquid state in the plant at a temperature of > 130 \u00b0C. It is classified as a harmful irritant (R41, R37/38 and R42/43) and is not listed in Annex 1 to the Incidents Regulation.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The ignition of the phthalic anhydride was probably caused by sparking resulting from short-circuiting of electrical cables positioned close to the ground. The cables were flooded by the hot phthalic anhydride, melting their insulation.",

        "Accident Description": "A fire and 2 explosions occurred in a soluble sulphur production plant, caused by successive ignition of powder clouds created by local overheating. The drying vaporiser and silo caught fire, and the washing water pipes were destroyed.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident happened as follows: the primary material, which contains sulphur, was stored in iron vats, thereby creating iron sulphites by reaction between the sulphur in the product and the iron in the containers. These substances are normally recycled in the plant's washing water, and an aerosol liquid is prepared by drying. The drying phase was very long, and an aerosol outlet nozzle was blocked, causing local overheating. All this, combined with a build-up of the substance at the base of the fluidised bed vaporiser, led to a large amount of substance, including iron sulphites, catching fire. The dust cloud, being within the vaporiser, then caught fire, and the fire spreads to the water washing equipment. The overpressure from the explosion damaged the water pipes. Among the equipment overheated was the valve nearest the water washer, which fell into the silo creating a dust cloud which then caught fire.",
        "Consequences": "8 firemen were slightly affected by fumes during the extinction of the fire. There was damage to the  production unit.",
        "Emergency response": "The plant firefighters started to work as soon as the fire was detected, but given the scale of the accident, the plant operator started the internal emergency plan (POI), and then subsequently the Departmental Prefect set into action the external emergency plan (PPI). The workers were evacuated as soon as the fire started. In total, 70 members of emergency services were involved.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The prevention and detection measures to be implemented aim at removing ignition sources and at detecting them as soon as possible if they should appear:1) more frequent cleaning of the vessel walls to avoid the formation of encrusted material2) installation of a filter on the fluidised bed heating equipment to avoid generating hot particles3) although the mechanism is not fully understood, the principal parameters governing the risk of exothermic reactions are the temperature, the amount of substance present, and the presence of iron. The preventive measures are therefore: reduction of temperature at start-up, detection of accumulation of substance by installing sensors, not stocking the product in iron vessels, and avoiding the re-injection into the process of recycled water, which can have a high sulphur content.The protection measures rely on the materials used in the installation being non-inflammable. It is therefore proposed:&nbsp;- that the first stage of the water washer and the ventilation ducts be built of non-inflammable material&nbsp;- that rapid-closing valves be installed between the fluidised bed vaporiser and the water washer (this is also to be applied to other vaporisers connected to the washer)&nbsp;- to review the location of the final product storage silos in relation to the water washer."

The schools quickly evacuated all their students. People's Hospital at Mudu Town timely received and treated the patients. At that time, 20 patients stayed at hospital for further observation, and 4 were hospitalized for further treatment. Later on, other students and nearby residents felt uncomfortable and went to hospital to be checked and receive treatment. After an investigation, it was found that the culprit was an agro biochemical plant (hereinafter briefly called \u201cCompany\u201d). The Company's major products include: diuron, phosgene (intermediate), methyl chloroformate, diethyl carbonate and refined methyl chloroformate. At 5:30 am on December 8, the No.2 frozen brine circulating pump at the Company's phosgene workshop failed to work, and improper operations caused the leakage of toxic and harmful gases (mainly including chlorine-containing acidic gases and a small amount of phosgene). Because the wind was weak that day, the leaked toxic and harmful gases spread to a scope 1.5km from the factory, causing some students of the two schools to become direct victims.",

        "Accident Description": "Around 10:30 pm in the isocyanate unit at a Seveso-classified chemical plant, a sensor detected a rapid conductivity rise in a heat exchanger, in which phosgene (COCl2) pressurised to tens of bar was being reheated with water vapour at 28 bar before reacting with an amine. Once the sensor alarm threshold was reached (50 \u00b5S), the safety controller isolated the drainage circuit for exchanger condensates by closing a motorised valve. A second conductivity meter, which had not been functioning properly and was scheduled for replacement by maintenance staff, displayed a value of 0 \u00b5S. Uninformed of this malfunction, technicians decided to shut off the amine intake at 10:40 pm and extract a sample to confirm their suspicions; they notified the on-call operator, who carried out an on-site assessment of the situation at 11 pm. The operator then proceeded to bypass the conductivity meter in restarting production without waiting for laboratory results to be released.\nAround 11:30 that evening, external sensors detected a COCl2 concentration build-up. By 11:52, a pressure sensor on the vapour circuit was reading in the tens of bar, triggering shutdown of the unit by closing shutoff valves on both the enclosure confining the unit and the condensate drainage circuit. The quick sequence of these closure steps caused a water hammer that broke a drainage valve at the base of the exchanger; the remaining COCl2 spilled into the enclosure, lowering vacuum pressure and closing the exchanger bypass valves. COCl2 sensors inside the confinement detected a rise in COCl2 content, reaching saturation at 1:10 am (1,000 ppm). A tube opened inside the exchanger and a large quantity of COCl2 spread into the vapour circuit with pressure increasing rapidly. Before the circuit could be closed as a safety precaution, a small amount of gas escaped via the soda tank drainage circuit, whose buffer (lid) had not been sealed following an improper reassembly step. The COCl2 discharged into the atmosphere in the time it took to isolate the enclosure wound up saturating the outside detectors (2 ppm), with measured concentrations gradually declining until 12:25 am",
        "Causes of the accident": "An expert appraisal of the leaky tube revealed the presence of acid corrosion accelerated by Cl- hydrolysis during shutdown periods. A break in the seal on an exchanger tube had caused a small COCl2 leak within the vapour circuit along with a rise in condensate conductivity due to COCl2 hydrolysis into HCl. Unit restart served to accelerate corrosion via HCl from the leaky tube until pressure burst it open: 700 kg of COCl2 spilled into the enclosure and 14 kg into the atmosphere while isolating the enclosure, as well as from the soda tank. Moreover, the sampling system on the 2nd conductivity meter had shown recurrent signs of malfunction subsequent to flow rate interruptions (this problem was known to the maintenance department yet not shared with operations personnel).\nOnly successful implementation of the 2nd safety barrier (pressure sensor and its safety chain, in addition to integrated enclosure confinement) avoided the discharge of a large quantity of toxic gas outside the site boundary (with dwellings as close as 260 m).",
        "Consequences": "Between 1 and 3 am, 4 technicians of the unit working outside experienced a slight intoxication and were sent to the site's infirmary.",
        "Emergency response": "The confined gases were neutralised on a scrubber column until the enclosure was free of all COCl2 during early afternoon",
        "Lesson Learned": "The 2nd conductivity meter was repaired and a flow alarm installed on the sampler; also, the condensate drainage circuit was inspected and all equipment damaged by the acidic atmosphere (caused by COCl2 hydrolysis) in the enclosure was replaced. The seal on the soda tank lid was checked and the tank pumping procedure modified to avoid the opening of the lid. Other procedures were formalised or consolidated, namely:\n- instructions in case of activation of the unit's technical safety barriers: conductivity meter, pressure sensor, etc.;\n- Bypass of the unit's technical barriers: awareness-building for both technical staff and managers, definition of each team member's roles and responsibilities, clarification and restriction of authorised bypass conditions;\n- Conditions applicable to unit technician certification regarding both process safety and equipment inspection;\n- Frequency of conductivity meter calibration (shortened from 6 to 3 months);\n- Formalisation of information/feedback loops among operations teams and the online analyser maintenance department.\nThe Classified Facilities Inspectorate asked the site operator to review the criteria adopted for activating the internal emergency plan and better inform staff of the role played by technical safety barriers, as even backup barriers did not justify bypassing a barrier without first analysing the compensatory measures that would eventually need to be implemented."

The accident occurred during modification works, carried out by an external firm (mechanical and electrical/instrumentation maintenance assistance), which was connecting tank TK 2.2 to the waste water network. For this work, a regular work permit and a hot work licence were issued, the latter having been issued following preliminary checks for the safe preparation of the area, in accordance with the applicable safety management system (SMS) procedure. By 9:30, the external workers had cut the pipe that was being worked on using an angle grinder and were preparing to place the new pipe, as planned, after having constructed the fitting where the pipe was to be attached. The event occurred when the previously cut pipe was being sealed, while an electric arc welder was in use. The external workers involved (two operators, with appropriate PPE) were on a work platform set up to ensure the safety of the activities in question, approximately 8-10 m above ground level. This work platform was approximately 5 m from the outer perimeter of tank TK 2.2. The way the event developed resulted in an internal domino (cascade) effect which affected all plants at the establishment.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident occurred as a result of modification works that were being carried out by a third company, which was modifying a connection between the wastewater network and tank TK 2.2. The use of an electric arc welder when sealing the previously cut pipe caused the flammable mixture within the tank (waste water vapour) to ignite. Furthermore, according to statements from the plant operators, the tank on which the line modification work was to be carried out (TK 2.2) was blanketed with nitrogen pumped in through the same pipe that was cut and then welded, at approx. 2.5 bar. It is possible that, precisely as a result of cutting the pipe, the inert nitrogen atmosphere was lost due to the broken connection.",
        "Consequences": "The fire affected all production areas, directly and by heat radiation, as well as part of the laboratory building, the control room adjacent to the production units and the cooling tower area.No pollutants were found in the waters of the Venetian Lagoon, although traces were found in the industrial canals.The following property was affected: all of the establishment&rsquo;s plants, which were totally destroyed and are now no longer usable (apart from 15&nbsp;metal tanks). The costs amount to: EUR&nbsp;35,000,000 (material losses); EUR&nbsp;14,000,000 (response, clean-up, restoration costs).",
        "Emergency response": "At the time of the event (approx. 10:20), the Internal Emergency Plan (IEP) was activated by the shift emergency coordinator (shift attendant) and external emergency services were alerted in the form of a call to the local station of the Venice fire brigade (VVF). The External Emergency Plan (EEP) was then activated by the Venice Prefect\u2019s Office, following notification from the fire brigade. Following intervention by the emergency services, the fire was brought under control at approx. 14:00, and the emergency was declared over at approx. 17:00. The fire brigade then checked the still-active pockets of fire and made the plants safe by: monitoring (using a thermal camera) and cooling one reactor; intervening on one tank on-off valve. The operator, together with the fire brigade, then surveyed the site and the effects of the event in order to begin work to make the site safe, which lasted for 1 month (until all the tanks containing hazardous substances present at the establishment were completely emptied). After the event, the following emergency and environmental operations to make them safe were carried out: a contract was concluded with a company specialising in making sites environmentally safe, resulting in a plan being issued; all tanks were completely emptied and the site was made safe by removing all hazardous substances present at the establishment; the environmental status was continuously monitored during decommissioning activities (hazardous substances possibly present in the air); cleaning of underground utilities, remediation and refurbishment of collection and sewage systems.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nAlways conduct a risk analysis on all types of modifications in accordance with the appropriate SMS procedure for management of changes (preliminary risks, risks during implementation and risks during operation), resulting in the identification of preventive and protective measures to be implemented, as well as the related training activities for the staff involved.\nAlways keep systems subject to modification works under isolated and inert conditions to prevent the environmental conditions from changing, which could lead to the formation of potentially flammable and/or explosive atmospheres.\nThe work permit process must always pay attention to: checks prior to and/or during the performance of the activities, supervision by the persons responsible and formalisation.\nFollow the procedures for the correct positioning of stores of hazardous substances and mixtures on the forecourt (e.g. tanks, drums, IBCs, etc.), including related fire protection systems and equipment, as a result of an appropriate risk analysis.\nDuring inspections by the competent authorities, pay attention to the link between risk analysis and management of changes, including those of a temporary nature, in the fine chemicals sector (batch reactions).\nCarry out continuous analysis of the operational experience gained from accidents, near misses and anomalies through the specific SMS procedures, and record in the relevant documentation the causes identified, the substances involved, how the incident happened, how the emergency was managed and the corrective actions implemented, instead of simply describing the events.\n"

Concerning the off-site emergency plan it can be noted that its activation had mainly a precautionary purpose, because the impact area of the accident did not affect, according to evidence, either the railway line (during the first phase of the accident before train circulation had been stopped two trains had passed), or the Flaminia road adjacent to the establishment.As a precautionary measure the military authority ordered the evacuation of barracks located near the establishment.The roofs of tanks TK231 and TK232, affected by the fire, were kept safe under a protective layer of extinguishing foam deposited on top of the roofs after the fire had been extinguished Emergency measures - Remarks: Concerning the emergency measures taken off-site, the population was alerted (ref 7302) over a loudspeaker system, installed in adequate locations in the town of Falconara, by the municipality of Falconara in common agreement with the establishment specifically for emergencies occurring in the refinery.\nThe measures still necessary at the time of the inspection consisted substantially in maintaining a cover of extinguishing foam on the roofs of the storage tanks involved in the fire (see short report).\nOfficial action taken - legal action: An investigation is being carried out by the State Attorneys Office. The judicial seizure of the equipment and plants involved in the accident was ordered.Official action taken - other official action: Following the accident a special meeting of the competent regional technical committee was organised as foreseen by decrees implementing the Seveso Directive in Italian law.  During the meeting, after having evaluated the gravity of the accident, a series of safety measures to be adopted by the establishment in the short and medium term were identified. These included the delocalisation of the gasoline storage tanks nearest to the railway track and the public roads towards the area near the shore.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Concerning points C and D, it has\nbeen decided to maintain the default indication NO. This choice has\nbeen made because an official inspection ordered by the Minister of the\nEnvironment (in compliance with art 18 of Directive 96/82/EU) is being\ncarried out with the specific goal to verify the implementation by the\nestablishment management of the Safety Management System with regards\nto the prevention of major accidents. During the follow up of to the\ninspection it will be mandatory to consider the consequences of the\naccident that occurred. This will also be the appropriate seat to\nevaluate the adequacy of the measures taken concerning points c) an d).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: Considering the accident dynamics causing the death of two refinery employees, who were also members of the refinery emergency response team, and considering the assumptions made with respect to the causes of the accident, it is reasonable to expect that maintenance and operating procedures of the installations have to be reviewed and that training of the operators in charge of these operations has to be improved."

        "Finish Date": "2016-03-29 18:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "The incident started in the upper level above the panel foam production area for production line 3, at a height of approximately 4 metres above floor level. This upper level area was partially closed on the side and adjacent to the finished products store (polyurethane sandwich panels). The upper level area is not clearly defined as one of the plant\u2019s units (storage/production); its function was to reduce the volume of the production area below to ensure that it was sufficiently warm to enable the reaction needed to produce polyurethane foam, which is a continuous process. Some polyethylene spools were stored in the upper level area, even though they were not used there. The spools were in fact used in the panel finishing production line. During the incident, production line 3 was in operation under the upper level area, where polyurethane panels were being manufactured using pentane (from the raw material tank MP via an underground pipe that was cut off at source during the fire, at the point where it is turned on at the pump, by the operator manually blocking the production line) and using the catalyst (taken from the MP tank via an underground pipe from the tank that was subsequently entirely destroyed in the blaze). The fire, which started in the upper level, rapidly spread to the production line below, the rock wool panel production line, the curved panel production line, a finished products store (storage area 3), a stock of chemical products comprising five tanks for storing isocyanate of 35 m3 each, five tanks for storing polyol of 35 m3 each and two tanks for storing the catalyst (N&nbsp;N-dimethylcyclohexylamine) of 12.5 m3 each.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The incident was in all probability caused by soldering work that was being carried out by two contracted companies, required to change (move) the container for storing pentane to a new area considered to be more safe.Direct causes -Event that initiated the incident:a fire started through contact between a soldering spark that fell onto combustible material (spools of polyethylene) that was in the work area, and then spread to the entire wing of the building, setting alight dangerous substances in a secondary outbreak.Major event:a fire that spread throughout the entire building used for the production of polyurethane foam (finished products and covering material) which entails the use of Seveso-category dangerous substances (pentane, residual quantities trapped in the underground pipe supplying the production line, and the catalyst in the raw material storage area plus the residual amount in the pipe).Root Causes, which can be attributed to management failures in the safety management system (SMS):\n\nperforming soldering in an area that is not totally safe on account of the unjustified presence of a combustible material in the upper level area;\nthe absence, at the time of the incident, of a specific procedure specifying how to perform the work for which permission has been granted; the interference risk assessment document (Documento Unico di Valutazione dei Rischi Interferenziali - DUVRI) was filled out for the work carried out (compulsory under health and safety at work legislation); this does not replace the work permit in the strict sense. However, the DUVRI used (dated 1.2.16) specifies that safely measures were to be adopted in the event of any soldering work, such as: blocking off the location where the soldering takes place with appropriate screens, so as to avoid sparks or burning material falling on people or on flammable materials; keeping any combustible/flammable materials away from the location; keeping one or more fire extinguishers to hand to be able to take immediate action in an emergency; Measures that it emerged had not been carried out; Failure to respect the safety provisions laid down in the interference risk assessment document (DUVRI);\nThe external company used for soldering work in a production area of combustible materials was not sufficiently qualified to do so: failure to define the criteria for selecting service provider companies. Failure to check the training given to external companies;\nThe SMS safety management system was never audited nor inspected; had it been, the above-mentioned failings would have come to light.\n",
        "Consequences": "The damage incurred was mainly material, as the entire west wing of the plant was destroyed (a building of 16&nbsp;000 m2). The fire notably destroyed the rock wool panel production line, the curved panel production line, a finished product store (store 3), a stock of chemical products comprising five tanks for storing isocyanate of 35 m3 each, five tanks for storing polyol of 35 m3 each and two tanks for storing the catalyst (N&nbsp;N-dimethylcyclohexylamine) of 12.5 m3 each + 20 movable containers of 1 m3 each.\nBurning polyurethane and its individual components create toxic smoke. The plume of smoke rose to a height of approximately 400 metres; the inversion of the vertical thermal gradient resulted in an interface that acted as a roof&nbsp;coming into contact with the cloud of smoke. The cloud moved north-west, borne on a light wind, spreading over a couple of kilometres before completely dispersing into the atmosphere. The relatively calm weather meant that the plume of smoke reached considerable distances with regard to its point of origin as it scarcely mixed with the surrounding air. The huge fire produced a black cloud that could be seen from kilometres away, as declared by the Prefecture, and spreaded over the connecting streets (closed to traffic) and the surrounding areas; the Prefecture declared a state of emergency to ensure the intervention of the fire brigade and ambulances and adopted precautionary measures to safeguard the population. The relevant health and environmental agencies were instructed to monitor and test the area&rsquo;s water, air and soil in the province concerned and the neighbouring province, belonging to other region. Pending the results of the monitoring and tests, the mayors of the municipalities concerned issued emergency orders adopting a series of precautionary measures to protect public health.&nbsp; On 8 April following the results of the monitoring plan, almost all the restrictive measures were lifted. As a purely precautionary measure, certain restrictions on livestock grazing and harvesting fodder in the area concerned were maintained. The tests carried out by the environmental agencies detected a concentration of toxic substances below the legal limits for both the air and the soil.",
        "Emergency response": "At the moment when the fire broke out in the departments affected by the incident, 14 employees were present, of whom two fire officers, plus two external workers. Given the presence of flames in the upper level area, the workers intervened immediately, as provided for in the Emergency Intervention Plan (PEI), and tried to extinguish them with portable fire extinguishers. Although the fire extinguishers were used promptly, they were not sufficient to put out the flames, given that the fire had spread with extreme speed and reached the roofing panels. The foreman (and the fire safety officer), having realised that it was not possible to tackle the emergency with the firefighting equipment on site, ordered the evacuation of all workers present and took steps to secure the plant, specifically by: turning off the electricity in the area affected by the fire and the immediate vicinity; cutting off the gas and liquid fuel supply. At the same time, the other fire safety officer called the Fire Brigade. When the fire brigade and ambulance service arrived on the scene, at around 14.05, a considerable area of the plant was already on fire and - to be more precise - the west wing, partly used for production and partly as a store for polyurethane sandwich panels. Given the speed with which the blaze spread, aided by the wind, and the intense production of thick black smoke, the combustibility of the products present, the huge quantities of product in storage and finally the presence of a storage tank of inflammable liquids (polyol and isocyanate), the sole operational possibility was to avoid the fire spreading to other adjacent areas both to the east and the west. The laminated wooden frame connecting the reinforced concrete and metal load bearing pillars was totally burned in the fire, causing the structural collapse of the roof and the lateral buffer walls, which imploded.\nAt approximately 19.00, the moment at which the flammable liquids in the metal above-ground storage tanks located to the west of the plant stopped burning, the fire could be considered under control, although the material stacked inside continued to produce flames and smoke even after that time. The extinguishing operation continued throughout the night and part of the next day.\nOverall 22 fire engines and other devices, including a helicopter and an air tank, were used to extinguish the fire, contributed by various Fire Brigades. All the staff present implemented the internal emergency plan properly. The prompt activation of the emergency plan meant that all the workers were grouped together in a safe area and the fire was prevented from spreading to the dangerous substances on site in the plant. The external emergency plan was also activated. The technical departments of the relevant health and environmental agencies were instructed to monitor and test the water, air and soil in the province concerned and the neighbouring province. Pending the results of the monitoring and tests, the mayors of the relevant municipalities issued emergency orders adopting a series of precautionary measure to protect public health. The measures were maintained for ten days, until the test results received back from the various laboratories confirmed that the concentrations were below legal limits in all environmental media (air, water and soil).\nAfter the emergency, and the clean up of the water used to extinguish the fire inside the building that was collected in the water recovery system and of the surrounding area, the plant restarted operations immediately.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The need to ensure that areas where processes requiring heat are carried out are totally secured;&nbsp;\n\nthe need to set up specific procedures for work permits in order to properly manage contracted work; the work permit must be drawn up and tailored to the specific work to be performed; it needs to identify the individual transfers of responsibility for performing the various steps in the work process between the company and the external companies, define the specific risks in the work environment, how to make them safe and by what means, specify the result of the action taken and how to put the plant back into operation;\nthe need for external companies used to outsource specific tasks to be adequately informed, trained and verified with regard to the risks associated with the work to be carried out on site;\nthe need to properly define the criteria for selecting the companies used for outsourcing, especially those carrying out hot work;\nthe need properly audit the company\u2019s SMS management system, to as to bring any shortcomings in the system to light.\n\nMore generally, manufacturing companies where negligible quantities of dangerous substances are used only peripherally in the production process, and that play a peripheral role with regard to the volume of production and the quantities of the finished products produced, have a tendency to consider their actual conditions as \u2018less critical\u2019 compared to other Seveso cases, and therefore to adopt an SMS that is generally \u2018not sufficient\u2019 to securely manage a context that should not in actual fact be underestimated (the presence of considerable quantities of combustible material) for its potential to increase the seriousness of any potential accident."

Bottle fragments were projected more than 100 m (300 m according to the firemen), with one piece flying all the way to another company 500 m away.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Initial investigations show that the explosion probably took place during a transfer operation from a source bottle with a volume of 40 l and a capacity of 39 kg, manufactured over 50 years ago and issued from a stock of old bottles recovered on the site. It did not show up in the tracking system set up 10 years before the accident. The target bottle, with a volume of 40 l and a capacity of 50 kg, had been manufactured 2 years before the accident. It is probably the target bottle that exploded and its fragments perforated the source bottle and a dozen other bottles that were in the facility. Traces of calcination (soot deposits on the damaged bottles and on the transfer manometer) and a cloud of black smoke seen by another worker appear to indicate that an exothermal reaction caused the explosion of the target bottle. A spectrometry vehicle sent by the rescue services in the afternoon detected the presence of trichloroethane in a sample of the content of the target bottle. This chlorinated solvent may form an explosive mixture with liquid Cl2 (alone, chlorine is a non-inflammable and non-explosive product). The possibility of a bottle explosion is not covered by the hazards study produced by the operator.",

        "Finish Date": "1996-09-02 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Interest of the accident in which a hydride is involved. Violent explosion took place during the batch production of chlorobenzorex from an aqueous solution of sodium borohydride contained in a feed tank on a movable truck.&nbsp;The sodium borohydride solution (44 kg of powder for 130 kg of solution) was prepared 2 hours before production in a closed 630 litre agitated feed tank. Since dissolving was problematic, the operating mode was recently modified to include prior heating of the solution by hot water surface runoff (45- 55\u00b0C). The reactor was placed under nitrogen circulation (N2) at 2h00 and then connected to the feed tank whose heating was stopped. At 2.15 pm, the feed tank's N2 inlet was connected to the supply hose. At 2.20 pm, N2 supply to the feed tank started with the partial opening of the supply valves of the reactor and the valves at the bottom of the feed tank (at a flow rate of 100 l/h - P(N2) = 2.8 bar). At 2.40 pm, the N2 hose supplying the feed tank was abruptly torn out letting the gas escape though the opening created. The superfluous staff was evacuated from the workshop and an emergency team installed a valve on the N2 inlet to stop the leak. The team tired to decompress the feed tank in the reactor by opening the reactor valve to the maximum and then opening the feed tank valve that was difficult to access. At this moment, the feed tank's manhole gave in a few seconds before it exploded.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Post-accident investigations revealed thermal decomposition of sodium borohydride triggered by an excessively high storage temperature (50 \u00b0C due to hot water surface runoff). Maintaining the temperature at 50 \u00b0C stabilised the decomposition rate in such a way that the small quantities of hydrogen (H2) formed could escape via the leaking feed tank. When the heating was stopped, the system evolved in an independent way: the temperature and pressure increased under the effect of heat resulting from the decomposition causing a thermal explosion. The inspection hole opened under a pressure of 15 to 20 bar followed by the rupture of the feed tank. The depressurisation of H2 in the form of a shock wave was responsible for the damage caused in the workshop.\nLastly, poor knowledge of the properties of hydride and absence of a critical analysis of the process were also responsible for the accident. Modification procedures and taking into account the various productions incidents would have certainly led to the missing critical analysis.",
        "Consequences": "The workshop was devastated: roof ripped out, light walls displaced, solvent pipes ruptured by the projections.

Almost total loss of chemical inventory well in excess of 5% of the notifiable categories of substances. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "The fire appears to have started inside the polypropylene tube of the conveyor, probably due to the unintentional mechanical heating (for reasons unknown) of the sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate until it reached thermal decomposition temperature.&nbsp; This may have been significantly lower than the 240oC temperature stated on the safety data sheet, as this is for a &lt;5mg sample and other experimental work has identified 45Kg can decompose at 65oC.&nbsp; Once at decomposition temperature, the chemical, which is an oxidiser, is self-reactive and generates heat.&nbsp; The polypropylene tube would have been heated until it started to deform and melt, mixing plastic with the oxidiser, leading to flaming combustion of the plastic. No forensic evidence has been available to identify with certainty the method of rapid fire spread or cause of fireball as yet.&nbsp; IBCs of hydrochloric acid and other chemicals, which were stored in the yard area immediately adjacent to the factory building, were damaged by the fire and released their contents, which may have been one of the sources of watercourse contamination.",
        "Consequences": "No significant human injury was reported, although there were some reports of minor respiratory irritation.Pollution of the River Colne was classed by the Environment Agency as Category 1 under their Common Incident Classification Scheme. More than 2500 fish were killed over a 6km stretch of the river.&nbsp; It is estimated that the river will take 4 to 7 years to return to pre-incident condition.&nbsp; The factory unit involved in the incident was completely destroyed, but there was only minor material loss to neighbouring premises. Various parked vehicles were damaged and one commercial mini bus was destroyed.Businesses were disrupted at other units on the industrial estate, with access being unavailable for approximately 48 hours.The A40 trunk road was closed for 24 hours due to the smoke plume blowing directly across the road.&nbsp; Access to Andoversford village was also disrupted for 24 hours.",
        "Emergency response": "The fire alarm was raised by a manual break glass alarm within the building, linked directly to the Fire Service control centre.&nbsp; The Fire Service responded initially with one tender but then upgraded the incident with more than 15 appliances attending.Approximately 25 people were evacuated from the factory unit immediately, going to the assembly point. Other factory units on the estate were evacuated by the emergency services.The first fire officer attending the scene was given emergency information by the company immediately on arrival on site.The Fire Service put emergency bunds and drain bungs in place as they dealt with the incident.Various outfalls from the drainage system were identified as the incident progressed, and these were blocked by the Environment Agency emergency response team.&nbsp; Chemicals were pumped out of various interception tanks in the drainage system.The Company appointed specialist decontamination specialists to clear the contamination held within the bunded area, and to remove the risk of rain run off adding to the pollution risk.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Mitigation measures to prevent the run off into watercourses appear to have been inadequate. The Company were unaware of the full layout of the drainage system and how their inventory could get into the watercourse.The UN classification of the sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate does not appear to give an accurate description of the reactive nature of the chemical and possible hazardous conditions.&nbsp; Under the classification system it is only because it has oxidising properties that it is not classified as a Division 4.1 self-reactive.&nbsp; If it were classified as a self-reactive it would be limited to transport in packages of 50kg or under, rather than be available as it is in 1000kg FIBC 'big bags.'

        "Accident Description": "As a result of a thunderstorm there was a significant interruption to the site electricity supply that resulted in the loss of reflux cooling to a distillation column within the Selective Hydrogenation Unit (SHU). The initial trip of the reflux pump was noted and the pump restarted, but a second trip went unnoticed. The steam supply to the column reboiler was on manual control and therefore did not trip leading to a rise in column pressure. The pressure safety valves (PSV), designed to protect equipment against overpressure, did not function properly, leading to overpressure in the column and overhead system.

        "Lesson Learned": "Change Management procedures must be applied to all changes, no matter how insignificant they may seem. Over time the operation of the steam reboil system had changed from automated to manual control, due to instability while on automatic. This was not a planned change, assessed through the formal Change Management process, but more an operational response to a daily operating difficulty. The consequence of this change, particularly during upset conditions, was therefore not adequately assessed.Further prevention actions:All equipment that may have been subjected to over-pressure was thoroughly inspected. PSV use was reviewed to determine the failure mechanism. The PSV inspection interval was reduced to a 12 month interval. An investigation of the reasons for the steam control to be routinely run on manual was conducted. This concluded that routine operation on automatic was unlikely to be successful. A high-pressure trip function based on column pressure was installed to cut-off the steam supply."

        "Accident Description": "On 01/09/2003 at around 10.00 pm a major fire broke out in a textile dye factory causing material damages amounting to approx. 50 million euro\nCause/sequence of events: the fire broke out on the second floor of the southern part of the concrete 4-storey production building, where textiles were produced, and extensively destroyed the second and third floors as well as the flat roof and the installations assembled there. The whole building was divided into several fire compartments. This safety measure, combined with the prompt action of the plant fire brigade, prevented the fire from spreading beyond the southern part of the building. The fire was discovered whilst a textile dye was being produced during the night shift in the vicinity of filter presses 3 and 4, which were both installed in one room on the second floor. According to a member of staff who was involved in and supervising production of the dye, the manufactured raw product was being pressed/washed with dimethylacetamide solvent (DMCA) in filter press 4 when he noticed naked flames coming from the filter press area. As filter press 3 was not in use, there is probably a link between the fire and the use of filter press 4. An explosion or a bang, which would indicate an explosive reaction or a deflagration, was not heard. Furthermore, it was asserted that one of the two fluorescent lamps fitted above filter press 4 was faulty and was no longer lit. Description of incident: On 01/09/2003 at around 10.00 pm a major fire broke out in a textile dye factory. Max. two barrels containing approx. 3 cubic metres of indanthrene dyes and solvents at most were burnt. Measurements conducted by the plant's environmental monitoring car and the professional fire brigade showed harmless concentrations of fumes in the surrounding area. The plant and neighbouring plants were evacuated immediately. The public authorities were informed. The police and local radio stations advised the public in the areas affected to shut their windows and doors. There were no personal injuries",
        "Causes of the accident": "It was not possible to determine the exact cause of the fire. Possible sources of ignition in the area of filter press 4 are:1. Overheating of oil hydraulics motor2. Hydraulic oil dispersed through leaky screw connection.3. Faulty explosion-proof lamp in booth (one light was not working).4. Source of ignition drawn in via exhaust pipe from northern part of building.5. Dimethylacetamide sprayed from a leaky flange.",

        "Finish Date": "1998-04-27 01:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "At 20:22 of 26 April 1998 (Sunday) an operator of the plant saw white fumes (Smoke) in correspondence with the CDI unit, adjacent to the hydrogen compression room and to the refrigeration units. The operator alerted the foreman, then the shutdown operation of the plant being controlled by a microprocessor with display on the control-panel was activated. This shut down operation involved the realisation of a by-pass for the part of the plant involved, operation which was foreseen by the emergency plan, with the assistance of the onsite fire brigade. At the same time the voluntary fire brigades of Merano, Maia Bassa, Maia Alta, Quarazze, Montefranco, Postal, Lana, Lagundo and Marlengo arrived, having been alerted by some person passing by who had seen the fumes (smoke). When the personnel identified the source of the fumes as a release of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) which combined with water (H2O), forms hydrochloric acid (HCl), which actually occurred due to the presence of humidity in the air and in the soil, forming a visible column of white fumes (smoke); the personnel proceeded in realising a vertical water barrier (curtain, in compliance with the emergency plan, in order to avoid the displacement of the fumes (Smoke) due to the  wind, attempting at the same time to avoid the direct contact of the water with the SiCl4 . The fire fighting teams which arrived from offsite attempted, on the command of their coordinators, to abate the fumes (smoke) without any discrimination with water hydrants. This caused the intensification of the chemical reaction described above. Further to the water also a special foam (suitable for non-flammable products) of RID class 8 type was employed. Following the above described facts the fumes moved in direction of the wind (southwards) affecting also residential areas and the National road. The water used by the emergency teams was collected in a extinguishing water collection basin, foreseen for being treated in the sewage plant (with pH correction, etc.)",
        "Causes of the accident": "failure of the safety valveThe gravity of the accident has been increased due to the use of water hydrants in the abatement of the fumes",
        "Consequences": "Ecological damage: principally concerning the area of ground directly in front of the plant in the area corresponding to the position of the valve (approx. 400 m2) inside the establishment.\nMaterial loss: approx. 200 kg of SiCl4. Interruption of the circulation from 21:00 hrs. to 23:00 hrs of 26/04/98People - remarks:Approx. ten (10) persons have presented themselves at the ambulances which had been alerted by the civil protection, nobody was hospitalised due to the fact that there was no evidence of the need of medical treatmentMaterial Loss - remarks:The production loss has not been evaluated because of the seizure, it has not been possible to estimate the amount of days ion which the plant was shut down.The sum estimated in 20000 - 25000 EURO refers to the removal and dumping of the layer of contaminated groundAffected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "Further to the response action&nbsp; of the emergency teams described above, alarm signals were given by the Civil Protection with sirens placed in the structures of the fire brigades of Merano, Lana and Postal. At 21:50 the local \"mass-media\" were contacted (radio, television) which have sent information on the occurrence, giving instructions on how to behave (sheltering indoor with doors and windows shut)Official action taken - legal action: Seizure of the plant by the Attorney General of Bolzano, with the nomination of experts",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: Due to the fact that it can't be absolutely excluded that smaller accidents can occur in installations of this type, even with all foreseen precautions, a better co-ordination of the offsite emergency response actions with those foreseen onsite the establishment would be appropriate. The emergency should be managed by an unique coordination centre coordinating the local structures involved."

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The accident occurred during maintenance in the chlorine transfer circuit. The accident case history was as followed:- 03:20 Production stopped.- 04:00 Clearing of tank V-2500 (see diagram No 2 attached to the Original Report) from liquid chlorine (pumped into buffer tanks).- 04:30 The remaining liquid chlorine in the heater section was (supposed to be) released to tank V-2504 (see diagram No 2). After the accident it was concluded that this step must have been executed in a too short period of time and only a partial boil-off of liquid chlorine resulted. So this section was still containing some liquid chlorine which was heated to about 80\u00b0C.- 04:45 An attempt was made to free the heater section E-2504 (see diagram No 2) from (residual) chlorine by the introduction of pressurized air. The presence of a one-way valve may not have been recognized (see diagram No 2). It resulted in chlorine inlet into the process air system. Process air system (7 bara) was responsible for chlorine distribution and emission in about 12 different sites on the plant. Therefore, chlorine emission occurred via several in- and outdoors sources.- 04:55 Chlorine detectors (limited to shipping and compression areas) intervened (chlorine concentrations up to 0.8 ppm during the accident) resulting in the automatic cut off of the equipment.- 05:00 The air supply to the heater was manually closed (although the cause of chlorine leakage was not known, possible chlorine sources were blocked in). After, the remaining contents of the heater section was fed to a chlorine destruction unit.- 05:25 Supervisor activated chlorine alarm (phase 0 according to the emergency plan: internal warning to personnel, external warning to local police).- 06:00 Shift change (the night-crew remained several hours until the situation became clear). Due to the specific (weather and emission) conditions, there was no significant dispersion.- 06:55 Supervisor activated chlorine alarm phase 1 (possible nuisance outside the plant).- 07:30 Several complaints from the neighbourhood (about 10) recorded. Local police activated alarm phase 2 (annoyance, no danger).- 07:45 Municipal fire brigade brought the alarm phase back to 1. At about 08:14 again to phase 0.- 08:30 All warnings were deleted by the safety division of AKZO plant.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:Due to the inadequacy of written maintenance procedures and to the insufficient training of personnel, an error was made by an operator during the maintenance of the chlorine transfer circuit (an attempt was made to free a heater in the circuit from residual liquid chlorine by introducing pressurized air but that procedure had been executed in a too short period of time). It caused the evaporation of the liquid chlorine and its entering into the process air system.&nbsp; In addition, the design of the heater circuit was not correct (it was possible, by mistake, to block in liquid chlorine).",
        "Consequences": "People - Remarks: No data are available about the number of people (inside and outside the establishment) affected by the accident. Anyway, no people were injured by the chlorine release.Material loss - Remarks: No significant material losses occurred because a complete plant shut-down was already scheduled and no corrosion occurred in the process air system (dry air).Disruption of community life: When the chlorine sensors detected the presence of gas in the area, phases 0 (internal warning of the personnel and external warning to local police) and, after, 1 (possible nuisance outside the plant) of the emergency plan were activated. Several complaints (about 10) from the neighbourhood were recorded by the police which activated phase 2 (annoyance, no danger). Measurements by fire brigades were carried out but chlorine in air was less than 0.2 ppm outside the establishment.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the chlorine sensors detected the presence of gas in the area, an automatic cut-off of the equipment occurred and the air supply to the heater was manually closed (although the cause of chlorine leakage was not known, possible sources were blocked in). After, the remaining contents of the heater was fed to a chlorine destruction unit. Supervisor activated chlorine-alarm (phase 0 of the emergency plan [internal warning of the personnel and external warning to local police] and then phase 1 [possible nuisance outside the plant]). Measurements were carried out outside the buildings but chlorine concentration in air was less than 0.2 ppm. A water screen was set up down wind from the plant by the company fire brigade (in cooperation with the municipal firebrigade).EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Supervisor activated phases 0 and 1 of emergency plan (warning of emergency services, i.e. municipal and other authorities). Several complaints (about 10) from the neighbourhood were recorded by the police which activated phase 2 of the emergency plan (annoyance, no danger). Measurements by the municipal/regional fire brigades were carried out outside the establishment but chlorine concentration in air was less than 0.2 ppm. Gradually, municipal fire brigade brought the alarm phase back to 1 and, then, to 0. At 08:30, all warnings were deleted by the safety division of AKZO plant.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:1- better training of personnel;2- preparation of written maintenance procedures.Two diagrams are attached to the Original Report.&nbsp; Diagram No 1 shows the process air system schematically. Diagram No 2 shows how it was possible to block in liquid chlorine in the heater section (no relief valve was provided). When the Original Report was prepared, there were no indications that changes in the installation will be made in order to avoid to block in liquid chlorine in the heater section."

        "Finish Date": "1996-05-27 10:05:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident occurred in two different phases, in successive times and in two different units. In the first phase a local fire occurred near the atmospheric vessel called TK103, containing a solution of NaOH in water of the RT1 plant (revamping topping) and used for neutralizing the acidity of the raw oil contained in the desalter of the TK2 plant. The fire caused damage to the tank and to the electrical cables running near the vessel. This fire has been definitively extinguished at 9.25. In the second phase at 9.45, an explosion occurred at the exit of the tube from the preheating oven (F301) of gasoil + H2 of the desulphurisation plant. This explosion damaged, besides the oven, various equipment in a radius of about 50 m from the explosion point. The fire following this explosion was of short duration.\nFirst incident: probable underevaluation, by the assigned to the operation, considered as of routine and then not at risk. Second incident: on the base of the available registrations, the cause may have been a series of erroneous consecutive actions by the operator who misinterpreted the instruments indications, and his disposition for the conduction of the process.The consequences of the second incident could have been more serious (not only with damage to structures, but also to people- it needs to be noted that the incident occurred in a zone in which numerous personnel, either internal or external, were present for the modifications going on the near-by plants), if the \"all clear\" internal alarm was given immediately after the end of the first accident; in that case many persons would have returned to their job and would have been taken by surprise by the second accident. This conclusion is supported by the considerable damages received by the materials (crane with extensible arm, van for material transport, hut from sheets of metals, materials for changes of parts, etc...) in a radius of 50 m from the explosion point.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The escape of the hydrocarbons contained in the tank TK103 occurred probably due to \na human error, during the manual operation of the dilution of the sodium hydroxide \nsolution (routine operation), protracted for an excessive time, leading to the overflow \nand emission of hydrocarbons in the canals and their flushing shafts collecting white \nwaters. The overflowing hydrocarbons reached the zone in which workers performed \nthe welding. The following fire and the extinguishing operations caused the activation \nof the protection devices of the grounding system, which resulted in interruption of the \nelectrical supply. Such interruption provoked the gasoil supply loss in the oven F301 in \nwhich the second accident occurred.  The increase in the temperature and pressure \ninside the pipes in which gasoil + H2 should have circulated occurred due to this \nsupply loss, with consequent overheating of the pipes resulting in rupture and \nexplosion.  Also in this case, a human error can be reasonably presumed, based on the \navailable computerised registrations, consisting of the undue silencing of alarms due to \ninsufficient supply and of high temperature and pressure and the subsequent omitted \ninterventions as foreseen by the existing procedures.\n\n",
        "Consequences": " A welder worker received burns in face in the first fire and light trauma to the rear. \nOther 3 workers were presented in the infirmary; some of them showed effects of light \nstate of shock or breathing difficulties.  In no case was the doctors intervention \nrequired but all workers were sent home.  A worker of an external company, escaping, \nreceived an injury by a nail in the palm of the left hand. In general the cures given \nwere first aid, or administration of sedatives or oxygen in the case of respiratory \nproblems.\nMaterial damages caused by the first fire around the sodium hydroxide recipient \n(rupture of electrical cables and of the insulation of the pipes connecting to the tank. \nThe second event provoked besides the damages to the oven and to the connecting \npipes, also damages to mobile devices like a crane truck, a light lorry required for the \nmodification works in progress and glass breakage and other damages to various \nobjects inside a radius of 50m from the point of the explosion.\nPeople - Remarks: The total number of persons at risk in the first event, considering its characteristics  (fire not particularly \nextended) can be quantified to 6-7, the intervention personnel included. In the second event, characterised \nby the potential of greater consequences, also if it was of shorter duration, the persons at risk are not easily \nquantifiable, since in the area there could have been present also people not directly involved in the \nmodification operations.\nEcological harm - Remarks: Meteorological data registrations give for the time of the accidents wind velocity of 1,9-3 m/s with variable direction between W-NW and E. The registrations concerning SO2, NOx, NO e NO2 of 6 fixed positions around the establishment indicate an increase of the normal mean value from 9 to 12 hrs. The maximum value of SO2 (282 ug/m3) was registered at about 10hrs at S-SE of the establishment. Max. for NOx (55,2 ppb) at 11hrs at S-SE.\nMaterial loss - Remarks: At the moment of the on-the-spot investigation the costs were not quantifiable, however they refer to the restoration of damaged parts of the plant and limited to the internal of the establishment.Disruption of community life: The news of the incident were reported at a national level by the ANSA agency and by \"Televideo RAI\"Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "The internal procedures provided the pre-alarm to the external authorities and their \nintervention only in case of alarm confirmation. At 8.45 the pre-alarm concerning the \nfirst accident was given (external firemen, \"Carabinieri\", prefecture, mayor, port \nauthorities). In the same time the internal emergency plan was put in action with the \ninternal fire brigade intervention with foam and water extinguishers of various kinds. \nThe emergency procedure required the evacuation from the nearby plants of all the \npersons not involved in the extinction efforts, which resulted in sustaining only \nmaterial damages and no personnel injuries.  After the pre-alarm, the persons assigned \nto the emergency, believing the incident has concluded, gave  at 9:25 an \"end of pre-\nalarm\" signal to the external authorities, which in the meantime have not intervened. \nIn the meantime, for prudence, the state of emergency was maintained inside the \nestablishment.  At 9:45, having verified the 2nd event, a 2nd pre-alarm to the external \nauthorities was issued: in this case the fire-fighting forces of Cagliari intervened; \nhowever when they have reached the establishment the 2nd incident was also \nconcluded.\nOfficial action taken - other official action: An action of the judicial authority (taken by from the jurists police on behalf of the Attorneys Office of the Republic of Italy in Cagliari) is on course in order to collect information.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: In both incidents the human error was of great importance. A first consideration is to \nmake the procedures of the training more stringent, repeating them at regular intervals, \nas well as the updating of the responsible personnel to the operations in the plant, \neven for operation considered \"routine\", emphasising the necessity of following to \nthe rule, the instructions received and above all the written procedures.\nAnother consideration consists of the opportunity of making more rigid the security \nprocesses prescribed for the modification and /or improvement of the plants, in \nparticular when external companies are used, when theses operations take place in \nthe vicinity of functioning plants, or with operations under work (routine or not), \nadopting a more stringent system for the working permits.\nHowever, because the experience teaches that human errors can happen, although everything is always possible, it would be opportune that some key interventions at the end of the functioning of the security of the plants can not be bypassed, ignored or silenced by the responsible personnel (blockage devices, alarms of extreme intervention, etc.).\n\n"

BY 4.45 pm, aRounds-man identified and isolated the leak at 500 m upstream to where the hydrocarbons were detected.The internal contingency plan was triggered at 17:00 hrs and the inspection authorities of classified installations were informed. A ship equipped for hydrocarbon recovery was stationed at the mouth of the river while two trawlers recovered hydrocarbon pellets from the river.Investigations revealed that the leak was detected only after 5 hours , 478 tonnes of fuel were spilled, of which 180 tonnes flowed into the river Loire.Subsequent to the spill public access restrictions to several beaches and fishing prohibition in the river estuary were issued and were gradually lifted between the 04/04 and 18 /04. Over 750 people were involved for three and a half months in cleaning up the 90 km of polluted banks (6,170 tonnes of waste was recovered and stored on-site before disposal). A 16 cm longitudinal fissure caused by corrosion localised under the thermal insulation was detected upon examination of the pipeline. The corrosion resulted from a water leak in a pipe located above the pipeline. Water infiltrated under the thermal insulation, causing corrosion and subsequently the fuel pipeline rupture. Despite several faults detected during the previous months on the same pipe rack, the operator failed to revise his inspection programme such to take into account the specific risks presented by this pipeline given its proximity with the river banks.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The defective pipeline, 12 inches in diameter and lined with thermal insulation, forms part of a pipe-rack composed of some 20 pipes on two levels. An examination of the defective pipe section revealed the presence of a longitudinal crack approximately 16 cm long by 1 cm wide adjacent to the observed local corrosion underneath the thermal insulation lining. Water flowing from a perforated pipe, positioned vertically above the fuel oil pipeline, infiltrated under the leaky thermal insulation layer, first causing the steel to corrode and then perforating the pipe.A pipe verification and maintenance programme was adopted for the refinery site in accordance with a procedure developed in April 2007and designed to establish the various inspection and maintenance periodicities depending on the type of pipe configuration and potential vulnerabilities.The importance of specific maintenance works on the pipe where the leak occurred was however poorly evaluated in this programme, despite a number of warning signs during the preceding months on this particular group of pipes and despite the potentially serious consequences of an accident affecting one of these pipes given the proximity to the riverbank.  ",
        "Consequences": "\nDue to the effect of tides and currents, the fuel oil dispersed onto the northern and southern shores of the Loire estuary. Hydrocarbonpellets were recovered on beaches in the neighbouring Vend\u00e9e Department and as far south as the Isle of Rh\u00e9. Pollution cleanup efforts,in some cases requiring mobilisation of up to 750 people at the same time, lasted three and a half months to clean not only some 60 km of fouled riverbanks, but also wetlands further inland (swamps, reed beds, etc.).Public access restrictions were issued for certain beaches and fishing was prohibited in the estuary; the restrictions would gradually be lifted between 04/04 and 18/04/2008.The environmental impact assessment on the flora and fauna was promptly initiated by setting up an accurate inventory of the number of affected birds. Observations performed twice a week by the National Office for Hunting and Wildlife revealed that that the number of bird deaths caused by this pollution spill was less than 10 throughout the entire Loire- Atlantique Department. The proportion of oiled birds kept decreasing as pollution cleanup progressed, with the affected bird population gradually leaving the area as time went by.Nonetheless, several tens of dead animals were recorded in both the Vend\u00e9e and Charente- Maritime Departments over the following days, even though no scientific causality correlation could be established, especially given the type of species involved.The operator provided most of the manpower and took financial liability for all damages, pollution cleanup costs and compensations to affected professionals.",
        "Emergency response": "\nThe Internal Contingency Plan was activated and a crisis team was set-up in the Prefecture. Significant resources were allocated to both land and aerial surveying.Shortly thereafter, a ship equipped for hydrocarbon recovery was deployed at the river mouth as well as two trawlers in the estuary equipped with special nets for collecting hydrocarbon pellets. Floating barriers were also deployed in order to recover floating hydrocarbons.The affected fuel line was shut down; inspections on the entire rack detected several on other lines corrosion points requiring repair.Following both the first inspections performed after the accident and the first conclusions of the refinery\u2019s internal accident investigation, several protective measures were implemented, namely:- permanent human surveillance along the pipe network bordering the Loire;- definitive shutdown of the defective fuel oil pipeline;- visual inspections and thickness controls critical points (braces, tapping points, etc.) after removal of the thermal insulation from the entire pipe rack bordering the Loire;- relocation of the service water pipe from the thermally insulated pipe-rack bordering the Loire.Moreover, a prefectural order prescribed the implementation of several technical and organisational improvement measures:_ Onsite :- Integration of liquid hydrocarbon and chemical product lines in the inspection schedule, considering their criticality with respect to environmental risks;- setting up of regulations for degraded thermal insulation detection and repair campaigns of;- setting up of regulations and procedures for repairing leaks on utility lines (particularly water and steam networks);- specification of requirements and allocation of remote detection equipment adapted to the various products and sensitive zones._ Specific to the pipe rack where the accident originated: - works on the ground underneath the pipe-rack, such to allow drainage of spills towards a gutter connected to the refinery\u2019s oily water network, thus preventing leaks from polluting the Loire;- installation of a permanent monitoring and leak detection system on pipe-lines located in the vicinity of the Loire by means of thermal cameras coupled connected to an image management and abnormality reporting system in the control room, completed by a leak detection device in the gutter, in case of leaks occurring beyond the field of vision of the thermal camera system;- monitoring of product transfer operations by all means such to control that quantities transferred from the storage facility are actually received at the other end of the pipeline.An information and communication system for the various parties involved was introduced.This system comprises:- a daily press debriefing from the crisis team coordinated by the Prefect,- creation of a team assigned to distribute compensation to pollution victims,- organisation of regular meetings with local elected officials and associations,- constitution of a local information commission on river estuary pollution risks.",
        "Lesson Learned": "1/ Prevention measures: - The importance of monitoring corrosion or, put more\nbroadly, \"precursors\" of installation ageing in older plants and\nsites (which extends beyond the case of pipe networks). Special attention must\nbe paid to:  _ \"corrosion sensitive points\" (corrosion\nbeneath thermal insulation, contact with supporting braces, etc.); _ installations positioned in the vicinity of sensitive\nand vulnerable zones or located in an \"aggressive\" environment (tidal\neffects, medium salinity, etc.). - Special attention must also be paid to monitoring\nand maintaining pipe networks in the plant by means of establishing pertinent\ncriticality parameters (e.g. analysis of environmental risks related to a loss\nof structural integrity, sampling and control modes that enable early detection\nof corrosion or defects, periodicity of controls adapted to degradation\nkinetics, acceptability criteria specific to a defect). Following this accident and based on results of\ninspections carried out on the Donges site pipes, a nationwide action was\nlaunched during 2008 focusing on probe controls of pipes carrying hydrocarbons.\nIn 2009, a widespread plan centred on the ageing of industrial installations\n(petroleum, chemical) was initiated by France s Sustainable Development\nMinistry, which by the end of 2009 will yield a national action plan. 2/ Detection and protection measures: The efficient control of certain specific operations\n(ship loading, pollutant transfer, etc.), especially on expansive sites,\nintegrates appropriate resources to be allocated to leak detection and\nprotection as well as vulnerability of the specific media. 3/ Means of intervention: For those media in need, an action plan is developed\nthat prescribes tools dedicated to impact evaluation, intervention and\npollution cleanup, for mandatory implementation in case of an accident; the\nconditions governing the availability ofsuch tools are also to be included."

        "Accident Description": "Fire damage at EURENCO Vihtavuori Ltd's gunpowder factory in Laukaa (Finland) was caused by the rapid combustion of vaporized ether. No specific reason for the fire was identified during the accident investigation conducted by the Safety and Chemicals Authority (Tukes), but it was presumably caused by static electricity or a hard bump that caused sparks. At the time of the accident, there were exceptionally high concentrations of highly inflammable ether in the atmosphere, which suddenly burst into flames. During the accident, which occurred in May 2012, two workers were injured, one of whom sustained severe burns. Tukes\u2019 accident investigation detected deficiencies in the company's ability to assess chemical risks, implement changes and comply with instructions. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "The ignited material comprised ether/an ether-air mixture and recycled material. The gravity of the accident was increased by the high ether concentration in the air in the mixer room. No definitive reason for the fire was established in the investigation. The fire was caused either by static electricity or a hard bump which caused sparks.Factors having an impact on the high ether concentration in the room:\u2022 In the risk assessments carried out, the hazards of vaporized ether had mainly been regarded as a disadvantage in terms of occupational hygiene.\u2022 No attention had been paid to the ether content of the recycled material, and the risks involved were assumed to be similar to those of pure nitro-cellulose.\u2022 No efforts had been made to reduce the volume of ether in the gelatinization of the recycled material in connection with the filling of the mixers.\u2022 No efforts had been made to reduce the vaporization of ether in the recycled material barrels during their storage.\u2022 The ventilation operating principles in the gelatinization building were not fully understood.\u2022 The exhaust ventilation in the mixer room was not switched on while the mixer was being filled.\u2022 The ether contained in the recycled material had not been taken into account in the area classification of the mixer room.Factors having an impact on the fire:\u2022 Only conductive barrels should be used when handling the recycled material. A serious error was made in the introduction of recycled material barrels as a non-conductive barrel had been taken into recycled material use at some stage.\u2022 After modification work, problems were experienced in keeping the lid of the mixer open, and the barrel lifter structures may have bumped against the edge of the mixer.The organisation has solid traditions of carrying out risk analyses, but there is still room for improvement in risk assessments related to chemicals. In the risk analyses, fire risks had been identified, but the fire extinguishing systems were regarded as adequate for extinguishing a possible gunpowder fire. The volume of ether and the possibility of a quick, explosive fire as a result of the ether-air mixture had not been identified.The hazards related to the machinery and equipment used in the gelatinization process had been assessed from the viewpoint of machine safety, and decisions on remedial measures had been made on the basis of the hazard assessments carried out. The impacts of the changes on process safety had not been assessed. The company guidelines had been deviated from to a certain extent in the planning and implementation of the changes. As a result of the changes, the mixer encountered usability problems, which had not been fully repaired during the past year. Repair measures were delayed by a lack of clarity in the flow of information between employees and supervisors and ambiguity concerning repair measures between the client and the outsourced maintenance staff.In the past few years, there have been many personnel changes in the organization and maintenance has been outsourced. These have had an impact on the functionality, expertise and flow of information in the organization.The organization has a management system along with guidelines. As a rule, the system and the guidelines function well. However, the guidelines are not fully observed at all levels of the organization, and this deficiency has not been tackled. In safety-critical operations, this is a serious shortcoming that undermines safe operations. In an operating system based on quality, environmental and occupational health and safety standards, there is also scope for specifying the industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and process safety. ",
        "Consequences": "An explosive fire producing extremely high temperatures broke out in connection with the gelatinisation of recycled material in gunpowder factory. The fire was put out quickly once the fire extinguishing system was activated. Two employees were injured in the fire, one of whom sustained serious burns. ",
        "Emergency response": "The fire was put out quickly once the fire extinguishing system was activated. Simultaneusly automatic alarm was sent. Fire and resque services, ambulance and police like represetants of the company arrived. Workers gave first aid by undressing the victims and rinsing with the water.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The investigation team proposes the following measures to prevent similar accidents. The recommendations are general, concerning the entire industry and similar projects.Recommendations for the purposes of supervision and the industry:\u2022 Guidelines should be observed. Regular training on the operational guidelines should be organized and it must be supervised so that the employees become acquainted with and comply with the guidelines. Important operational guidelines in terms of safety include organizational responsibilities, identification and assessment of hazards, change management, work instructions and management of deviations.\u2022 Procedures and guidelines based on quality, and environmental and occupational health and safety standards presented in the operating system should be specified from the viewpoint of industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and process safety. The (major accident) hazards related to them should be identified and managed in a systematic way. The functionality of the management system should be ensured and the development needs should be systematically identified also in terms of the industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and process safety.\u2022 The organization's functionality should be ensured in connection with organizational, personnel and process changes and when responsibilities change. The operating system should be kept up-to-date.\u2022 The persons in charge at the production plant and those planning and implementing the changes should be acquainted with the organization\u2019s change management procedures, which should be followed when changes are made in the production plant.\u2022 The protection plan should be developed in line with preventive risk management; the current nature of the protection plan is to react strongly to accidents.\u2022 In hazard identification and risk assessment, chemical safety should also be taken into account with the same degree of importance as explosives safety. The assessment team must include members with expertise in chemicals and the production process, and employees at the work site must be consulted.\u2022 It must be ensured that the employees are familiar with the work instructions and risk factors in their workplace and are able to identify them. Guidelines should be provided for the supervision of compliance with the safety and work instructions.\u2022 The processing of safety observations must have a follow-up procedure that motivates the employees to make safety observations.\u2022 Guidelines are to be drawn up for health and safety know-how and training procedures, and it should be ensured that the training needs for the personnel at the production plant are identified and determined in safety-related issues as well. Safety training should also be maintained and recorded.\u2022 The flow of information between contract partners operating in the plant area and the plant\u2019s personnel should be ensured.\u2022 Guidelines concerning the reaction to alarms are to be specified further. The causes of and reasons for alarms and the measures carried out should be recorded. The frequency of alarms should be monitored and the reason for recurring alarms should be tackled.\u2022 The monitoring of ongoing requirements by the authorities should be included as part of the systematic monitoring of deviations so that the requirements issued by the authorities are met within the specified time, or additional time can be applied for if necessary. Recommendations for the inspection body:\u2022 The validity of the area classification should be verified in connection with electrical inspections.Recommendations for focusing and developing Tukes\u2019s supervision and communication:\u2022 During periodic inspections, the functionality of the operating system and the awareness and observance of guidelines should be verified at all organizational levels.\u2022 Risk management regarding the industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and the special characteristics of process safety compared with the safety systems related to quality control, environmental and occupational health should be emphasized in supervision and communications.Recommendations for the development of legislation:\u2022 The application of chemical legislation in the manufacture of explosives is to be clarified. The legislation should also support chemical safety in the explosives industry.\u2022 The area classifications concerning explosive air mixtures and explosives applied in the explosives industry are to be clarified."

This may have had a possible relation with the explosion.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:No wind when the fire occurred.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:During modification works on non-energized electrical cables, at 13:05 a flash fire in the pumping station occurred followed after 1 minute by an explosion in the area. Ten minutes later, at 13:15 the first tank (250 m3 storage capacity for additives) exploded, and fired like a rocket up to about 200m, falling down 60 m away outside the storage area and spreading the fire to about 1/3 of the depot. The explosion of 5 other tanks followed. At 13:18 the local authorities were alarmed by telephone and, at 13:23,&nbsp; a first control center was made up by the fire brigade. At 13:28 the fire brigade (42 men and 4 fire-trucks) arrived on-site and started the procedures to isolate the storage installation; at the same time arrived the first medical service (3 doctors with an ambulance). At 13:40 the traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated. On-site there were 8 doctors, 5 ambulances and 2 re-animation vehicles. 18 beds for injured people were available. At 13:55, 117 policemen were present (200 at 14:20). At 14:10 the cooling of tanks (about 2,000m3/h by means of 25 monitors) was activated (it was carried out until the fire was extinguished). At 14:30, 200 policemen, 150 firemen, 20 doctors and nurses were present on-site. At 14:45, the Particular Emergency Plan was activated and the organization of emergency was under the direct control of the local Prefect. At 17:00 the fire spread all over the depot despite the water cooling. At 17:25 a first attempt to extinguishing the fire was carried out by means of 9 guns using 100,000 litres of foam. At 18:32 the explosion of another tank occurred and 6 firemen were wounded. The fire extended. The medical staff was reinforced. The explosion was due to boil-over of a tank containing 1,000 m3 of gasoil which created a fire-ball nearly 450m high and 200m wide. The fire spread to to the neighbouring storage area and to various buildings inside the installation. At that time, about 72,000 litres of foam were used. During the night 2 floating roof tanks in the near storage area caught fire. At 06:35 of June 3rd, a second attempt to extinguish the fire was carried out by means of 17 guns (2 of which with a large flow) using 200,000 litres of foam. The use of foam monitors with large capacity (6,000 litres/min) had proved really efficient. At 07:30 the fire in the storage area was extinguished. At 09:00 the fire was extinguished using 140,000 litres of foam during the second attempt (there was still a small leak at the bottom of a tank). At 13:48 the fire was completely extinguished. The cooling of the tanks continued for the following two days (4 and 5), using a limited amount of foam as a preventive measure. On June 6th-7th, a small quantity of foam was used, as a preventive measure, during the draining of some tanks. Polluted fire fighting water and unburned hydrocarbons that could be contained (about 10,000 m3 remained in the parks and drains) were collected and transferred by barges and wagons to a petroleum refinery for treatment.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nWhen the Original Report was prepared, the causes of the accident were still under investigation.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment, 2 people working in the storage installation were killed and 8 (3 slightly) people injured in the fire. 6 firemen were injured by the explosion of a tank. Fire fighting operations required the intervention of more than 150\nfiremen for about 24 hours. About 200 policemen were employed to\ncontrol the road traffic, evacuate the personnel in the industrial area\nand transport the foam during the night. 25 people (13 of them were\ndoctors) give medical help.MATERIAL LOSS:More than ten tanks in the storage area No 1 and 3 were completely destroyed (tanks No 6, 12, 14, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 59.1, 20 and 22) or damaged in such a way to make impossible their use. Also, the loading stations, the office building, some vehicles parked nearby and other components in the storage installation were destroyed. No data are available about the cost of the material damages.ECOLOGICAL HARM:During the fire were released into the environment sulphur dioxide, lead compounds and particulate produced by the combustion of hydrocarbons. The amount of sulphur dioxide and lead compounds had been estimated, respectively, in 12 tonnes and 600 kg. No data are available about the amount of particulate released. In the document attached to the Original Report the observed environmental pollution was not significant. When that document was prepared, the risk of pollution of underground waters due to the infiltration of hydrocarbons in the soil was not yet completely resolved and the control of the water bearing stratum had to carry out.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The map of the accident area together with the extents of the effects of the accident are shown on the document \"Incendie du Depot Petrolier SHELL Port Edouard Herriot - Lyon les 2 et 3 Juin 1987\" attached to the Original Report.Disruption of community life: The traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of:       Ecological component: water catchment areas and supplies for consumption or recreation - Affected 3",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the accident occurred, the local authorities were alarmed by telephone. The first fire brigade (42 men and 4 fire-trucks) arrived on-site and started the procedures to isolate the storage installation. The traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated.The cooling of the tanks was carried out by means of 25 guns employing about 2000 m3/h over 24 hours. The extinguishing of the fire was carried out, during the first attempt, with 9 guns employing 72,000 litres of foam. During the second attempt were used 17 guns and 140,000 litres of foam. After the fire was extinguished, the cooling of the tanks continued for the following two days, using a limited amount of foam as a preventive measure. On June 6-7, a small quantity of foam was used, as a preventive measure, during the draining of some tanks. Polluted fire fighting water and unburned hydrocarbons that could be contained (about 10,000 m3 remained in the parks and drains) were collected and transferred by barges and wagons to a petroleum refinery for treatment.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the accident occurred, the local authorities were alarmed by telephone and, soon after, a first control center was made up by the fire brigade. The first fire brigade (42 men and 4 fire-trucks) arrived on-site and started the procedures to isolate the storage installation. The traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated. The Particular Emergency Plan was activated. Fire fighting operations required the intervention of more than 150 firemen for about 24 hours. About 200 policemen were employed to control the road traffic, evacuate the personnel in the industrial area and transport the foam during the night. 25 people (13 of them were doctors) give medical help (18 beds for injured people and 11 operating rooms were prepared).Official action taken - other official action: Cleaning of the plant when the authorities will allow it.",
        "Lesson Learned": "MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE ACCIDENT:These measures will be defined when the results of the investigations will be available. In any case, a revision of technical regulations for hydrocarbons storage areas was foreseen. The main conclusions were the following:1- fixed-roof tanks without weak seam for roof-to-shell attachment are very dangerous because in case of overpressure (which may occur during a fire) the collapse will happen at their bottom part (hence, the released product can spread around feeding the fire);2- the application of cooling water is not very effective. Use of foam was very effective;3- need for special suitable foams for polar hydrocarbons storage;4- old regulations for storage installations were not adequate;5- concrete dikes do not guarantee resistance for a sufficiently long period of time in case of fire and, hence, earth bund walls are preferable."

        "Finish Date": "2002-11-10 16:01:00",
        "Accident Description": "The alkylation unit was going into shut down. Two contractors were fixing a copper tube to a T-piece of a drain. During the work they turned the T-piece over 90\u00b0. Due to this fact a valve on the T-piece was opened and an amount of HF was released. One of the contractors was very seriously wounded, while the other person was only lightly wounded.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Because the alkylation unit was shut down, the biggest equipment was already emptied and the installation was cleaned with nitrogen. Then it was decided to drain the unit to remove all fluids left. The drain consisted of two valves and a blind flange. The blind flange was removed and replaced by a T-piece consisting of a manometer and a small valve. The T-piece was mounted in a horizontal way. A permit was written for two contractors to add a copper tube to the small valve on the T-piece. Because it was not easy to work with the T-piece mounted horizontally they decided to rotate the T-piece. While rotating the piece, the handle of the small valve touched a pipeline and the valve opened and 360ml HF was released. This amount of HF was situated between the two large valves and the small valve on the T-piece.",
        "Consequences": "One of the contractors was very seriously injured. His eyes, nose and mouth were burned and he inhalated HF fumes, which caused internal injuries. The second person only had small injuries around his mouth. ",
        "Emergency response": "On-site the victim was given an antidotum (calciumgluconate) and an ambulance brought both victims to a hospital specialised in treating burn injuries. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Not allowed to make changes on the systems of the refinery. The T-piece on the drain was a temporary piece only\ninstalled for the shutdown. There was no standard in the company to which\ntemporary pieces had to comply. The T-piece used screw thread which made it\npossible to turn the T-piece. The accident showed that a standard for temporary\npieces must be drawn up. In the company it was seen as normal that the manual\nvalves in the line on which the T-piece was fitted had a small internal leak.\nSo in the work permit protective clothing should have been specified for\nworking on this line since they should have anticipated that HF would build up\nbetween the fixed (leaking) valves and the quarter turn valve on the temporary\nT-piece. A Quarter turn valve is easily manipulated accidently, certainly while\ndoing mechanical work in the immediate vicinity. "

        "Start Date": "1996-03-15 07:30:00",
        "Finish Date": "1996-03-15 16:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident occurred when a workman of the company was unloading propane from a road-tank (~35 m3) to the fixed plant via a flexible tube. For reasons not yet clear, a considerable release of gas into the atmosphere occurred. A vapour cloud was  consequently generated, which invaded the plant. Being not able to stop the release, the man gave the alarm following the procedures, to the firemen, the national railway (whose tracks run close to the establishment) etc. After the arrival of the firemen, just when initiating their action, a first explosion took place, followed by a fire. The fire involved the two firemen teams, the truck-vessel driver and the employee who had given the alarm. The truck vessel was cracked in the above side (a hole of about 500 mm) with release of a big amount of propane and formation of a little fireball. The fire's heat-radiation caused the explosion of a nearby truck-vessel containing only few litres of LPG. A fragment of this vessel (1500 mm long) was found at a distance of 500 m, after it had provoked the crash down of the roof of a room close to a one-family house. Other fragments were spread around at minor distances. The fire, besides destroying the two motor-pumps of the fire-fighting team, affected 2 other truck vessels containing 12 and 35 m3 of propane and an empty truck vessel (12 m3) and 2 railway-vessels of propane (70 m3 capacity) waiting for unloading.The accident originated at 7.30 on 15 march 1996, when an employee of the company was transferring liquid propane from a truck-vessel (35 m3), standing there from the evening before, to the fixed storage installation. For causes not yet identified by the authority of Treviso, a big leak of propane occurred with the consequent formation of a flammable cloud about 1,5 m high. At 7.40, being impossible to stop the leakage, the employee gave the alarm by a multiple automatic device, foreseen by the emergency plan and calling directly the firemen of Treviso. About 10 minutes later, two motor vehicles of the firemen arrived into the establishment taking position between the office building and the bottling platform, where it was assumed that the propane cloud had arrived that moment. In such position the two motor-vehicles were at 35m from the truck-vessel which had caused the release. While starting the action to disperse the cloud, for not yet established causes, a first explosion occurred and a fire spread up to the truck-vessel, which was source of the release. The fire which involved all the vessels and truck-vessels standing nearby and only partially one of the 12 storage tanks forming the fixed installation, was put under control by the intervention of other fire brigades. at about 16.00 o'clock the same day. The population evacuation in a radius of 400 m from the establishment has been protracted, precautionally, up to the morning of the following day. As far as it concerns the crack formation (500 mm large) on the top of the tanker which had released, it should have occurred 10-15 minutes after the fire broke out, while the explosion of the half-empty tanker (12 m3) occurred at about 9 hrs). This last caused the complete destruction of the metallic vessel, which divided into fragments of various size; the fragment retrieved at greater distance from the origin is the same which demolished the roof of a room annexed to a private uni-familiar residence 500 m far from the establishment and sited in the residential area of the town causing only material damages.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Accidental release of propane, ignition and explosion of the vapour cloud due to not yet established causes. The Procura della Repubblica of Treviso is still investigating.After further investigation:Probable causes of the release could be the following: human error of the operator responsible for the vessel unloading or malfunction/rupture of the vessel unloading devices. The fire of the cloud formed after the release was ignited by a source which is still under investigation by the \"Procura della Repubblica\" of Treviso. Explosion of the12m3 half-empty vessel with scattering of fragments, initiated by the heat-radiation of the fire.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE: 1 employee of the company (company caretaker) involved in the explosion together with the firemen died some days after in the hospital from serious injuries and burns. 2 employees of the company received burns to face and hands and were recovered to the hospital. 10 firemen received&nbsp; more or less serious burns and and were hospitalized.MATERIAL DAMAGE: Partial collapse of the office-building of the establishment, break of aerial pipes connected to the fixed installations, damage to the bottling plant and unloading equipment. Damages to outside due to the spread of fragments of the partially empty exploded vessel. Other external damages (glass break etc.) to be assessed. The costs are actually not quantifiable. Anyway an estimate has to be given in order to determine the costs related to the external damages and to the persons affected.Disruption of community life: Interest of media at national level only for the day of the accident and the day after. Locally the interest is still live due to direct involvement.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL: Alarm given by the operator assigned to the unloading of the truck-vessel, which was source of accident.EXTERNAL: Actions by personnel of the establishment to stop the traffic on the road to the establishment. Telephone call to the nearby railway station in order to stop the trains in circulation (this was a superfluous action since no train was circulating at that time due to a national strike). Request of evacuation of nearby houses by external authorities in a radius of 400m around the establishment. The persons evacuated (up to the following morning) were about 250.Traffic interruption in the entrance road to the establishment and in the railway for the time necessary for the arrival of the emergency vehicles, the aid to the affected persons and for the accident duration. the accident affected mainly the internal side of the establishment (persons and materials); anyway consequences (only for materials) are present also externally due to the propagation of fragments hurled around by the explosion of the 12 m3 vessel.Official action taken - legal action: An official investigation by the Police authority of Treviso is actually in course, in order to establish the accident causes and responsibilities.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: After the establishment construction in\n1963, many residences have been built around it without considering the\nrisks. The consequences would have been more serious in case of BLEVE\nor UVCE, involving also the external side of the establishment (as\nforeseen in the safety report). Such circumstances should be avoided in\nthe future by applying the directives of the so called \"SEVESO II\" on\nthe land use planning in case of a plant with the risk of major\naccidents.Measures to prevent recurrence: Realize in the future, in harmony with the \"SEVESO II\" directive and adequate planning policy of land use not allowing residential expansion near the high risk plants. Making more serious the obligations of the hazardous plants' operators in matter of safety and personnel training at every level of responsibility. In preparing emergency plans, internal or external, the consequences of any possible major accident should be taken into consideration independently from their more or less high probability obtained by the analysis of the safety report."

        "Finish Date": "2017-05-17 11:35:00",
        "Accident Description": "On 17 May 2017 a fire broke out at the refinery site due to the spontaneous ignition of iron sulfide in a vacuum column of the Atmospheric crude oil and vacuum distillation unit.\nCourse of events\u2018A vacuum distillation was shut down as part of a planned interim stoppage.The maintenance stoppage is undertaken as an \u2018intermediate stop\u2019 in the middle of the running time of 6 years or so between two full-scale shutdowns of the whole refinery, for example to change catalysts that cannot be run at sufficient power for 6 years.\nIn the lower part of the vacuum column (Zone Bed 6), coke deposits build up during operation, which gradually reduces the material flow through the bed, which means that the performance of the column diminishes. For this reason, it was planned, inter alia, to replace bed 6.This work is carried out routinely every three years. The column has already undergone similar maintenance five times in the past.\nIn the run-up to the maintenance stoppage, there were no particular changes to the vacuum column. The pressure loss through the packing had reached the expected value. The yield structures at the end of the operating period also show that operation was undisrupted and as expected during the past running period. There was no difference in the material load compared to previous maintenance intervals; the refinery processes a fairly constant crude oil quality. In particular, there were no elevated concentrations of sulfur.\nThe column system was shut down in accordance with the shutdown procedure.\nSubsequently, in accordance with a prior risk assessment, the preparatory works for opening the column were carried out.\nThe heading \u2018Cleaning of the column by a specialist firm (decontamination)\u2019 is of particular importance. This procedure involves pressurising the column with steam and water, to which a treatment product is added. The specialist firm promises that this will deactivate pyrophoric iron sulfide in the column (FeS2).Iron sulfide always forms in such columns to varying degrees depending on the sulfur concentration in the crude oil and the running parameters of the column.However, as this had been stable during the preceding running periods, it can be concluded that the mass of pyrophoric iron sulfide present is roughly the same. As the iron sulfide formed in the vacuum column has pyrophoric properties when exposed to air, this step is carried out before the column is opened in order to avoid a fire when oxygen enters.\nThis procedure was also successfully completed in previous maintenance stoppages.It is a standard practice in the industry.The instructions to the contractor given via the work authorisation slip and work package preparation in the stoppage planning software stipulated that after opening the lower and upper manholes to vent the column, manholes 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11 would also be opened.\nIn the daily instructions to the company for 16 May 2017, the manhole covers were to be put into place after opening manholes 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11. (Explanatory note: As the manhole covers are very heavy, swivel devices are sometimes used to move them. Putting into place in this context means that the manhole lids are swivelled back to their original position, but are not secured by bolts. A narrow gap remains between the manhole cover and the column.)The instructions also stated that if it proved necessary to run water through the head recirculation line, manhole 11 would have to be closed with two bolts.\nThis part of the instruction was not correctly carried out and all manhole lids were wide open on the morning of 17 May 2017.\nPreparations for entering and carrying out the work inside continued.At 11:38 on 17 May 2017, a smouldering fire was reported inside the vacuum column. The evacuation of the installation triggered by the alarm was disciplined and speedy.\nAt 11:40, the fire brigade was at the scene to investigate the situation. It was found that the escape route of three members of the maintenance contractor\u2019s staff on a platform at the head of the column was not free. In response, the refinery\u2019s site emergency plan was put into effect at 11:44. Neighbouring businesses, authorities and the public were immediately informed.\nThe fire brigade maintained visual contact with the three employees until they were rescued and used water to fight the fire and cool the column from outside. At 12:55, the employees were able to be rescued using a nearby crane with a passenger bucket. The delay was caused by the fact that the crane operator had quite properly left the plant during the evacuation and a new crane operator had to be called.At 13:14, the emergency doctor was able to carry out an initial examination of the people who had been rescued. Together with the crane operator and five other production and fire service staff, they were taken to nearby hospitals as a precaution. The last staff were released from hospital the following day.\nThe fire was extinguished by feeding in steam from the bottom and firewater from the top.At 14:50 the fire was under control and the refinery\u2019s emergency plan was stood down. A post-fire inspection was organised.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Spontaneous ignition of pyrophoric iron sulfide.",
        "Consequences": "Column internals damaged, EUR 2,000,000 damage",
        "Emergency response": "Evacuation of the plant area and then of the entire process area, safety intervention by the plant fire brigade, activation of the emergency plan, D1 notification to district control centre, etc., information to neighbouring businesses via DACS and information to local residents.\nRepairs to the affected parts of the equipment and testing of the equipment by the authorised testing bodies under the supervision of a Section 29 expert prior to it being put back into service.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Optimisation of the decontamination procedure for pyrophoric substances in sub-installations.\nMeasures laid down for repairs:\n\nPrerequisite for entry (inter alia): an erected crane with the means to accept passengers and a crane operator are available (secondary escape route/means of rescue for staff on the column if the way down is blocked).\nDetailed instructions for opening manholes.\nDetailed response to the risk of spontaneous ignition by means of various measures, including keeping the beds moist.\nPlans for a gas monitoring system with remote monitoring for early detection of a fire.\nAdditional gas analysis as cross-check.\nTemperature control in the column.\nProvide a clear indication of the placing and securing of manhole lids 11, 8 and 5 so that, in the event of a fire, there is no leakage of firewater and fire-fighting is effective.\nInstructions for fire-fighting in the event of failure of these measures.\nAdditional information on PPE (due to moistening, it is wet inside the column and it rains water contaminated with dirt and cleaning agents).\n\nThe implementation of the above measures, irrespective of the effectiveness of the additionally planned chemical treatment of iron sulfide, prevents spontaneous ignition and, in the event that ignition does take place, enables effective firefighting and thus ensures the protection of staff.\nMeasures to improve plant safety:\n\nEnsure an appropriate risk assessment with the mapping of the appropriate mitigation measures.\nRisk analysis documents are available throughout the refinery via a common database.\nIn order to address risks from pyrophoric substances, the safety measures under the Guideline for safety-critical organisational measures are to be identified and implemented without fail.\nTo further ensure that the procedures arising from the management system are properly implemented, there is a quality control through which the quality of risk analysis is verified by means of an audit programme. The auditors come from another part of the refinery.\nIn addition, a guide for chemical decontamination will be developed, which will also be discussed and communicated across companies in the refinery sector. One of the aims is to develop a checklist with appropriate measures to check the quality of decontamination.\nA further aim is to increase the operator\u2019s and industry\u2019s knowledge of the basis and effect of this process, so that the competence of a service provider in relation to the whole process can be thoroughly assessed.\nAt the highest levels of the organisation, more emphasis is needed on cross-disciplinary thinking as part of the safety culture (\u2018away from narrow, silo-based thinking\u2019) so that workflows can be understood and planned across the board.\nOther organisational measures relate to deepening awareness of risk analysis among key staff, in particular the importance of prerequisites for mitigation measures (such as the fixing of important manholes) as well as better training on the rules for entering restricted spaces.\n\n\nThe extinguishing plan for fires inside the column has been adapted.\nImprovements to damage limitation measures (secondary fire safety).\n"

        "Accident Title": "Release of para-toluidine from a bulk storage tank whilst a leaking pump was being replaced",

        "Finish Date": "2002-07-25 13:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "30 tonnes of para-Toluidine were released from a bulk storage tank whilst a leaking pump was being replaced. The maintenance technician removed the pump and was collecting a new part from the stores when the line isolation failed. \n\nThe incident is reportable under Schedule 7 Section 1(a) of COMAH because more than 5% of the qualifying quantity for very toxic substances was accidentally released.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "A work request was raised to replace a leaking pump for a bulk storage tank containing para-Toluidine (PT) on Monday 22 July 2002. The steam was turned off and the single automated isolation valve to the pump was closed.On 25 July work began to replace the pump. The line was broken to remove the pump. The maintenance technician then went to collect a new part from the stores leaving the work site unattended. No additional isolation was provided.Whilst the technician was away from the work site molten PT began to flow from the pipe over filling the spill bund and spreading across the site. It appears that the valve had failed or was not closed. In addition, the PT had not solidified as anticipated - it is likely that this was due to the head of available liquid in the storage tank and the high ambient temperature on the day of the incident.There are 2 principle causes for this incident. Firstly, the single automated isolation valve was open at the time of the release although it appears that it had been closed before the work began. At present, the nature of this failure is not clear. The clean up exercise continues and an assessment of the valve will be made when access is available.Secondly, the level of isolation provided was inadequate.&nbsp; The design of the plant means that there is only one automatic valve between the storage tank and the pump. Reliance was placed on the single closed valve and the nature of the product i.e. that its melting point is 44\u00b0C.A tank containing 30 tonnes of molten para-toluidine at 55 degrees C\n(melting point 44 degrees C) had a faulty pump connected to the bottom\nrun-off line. A fitter removed the main body of the pump for repair.\nFor physical isolation of the pump housing, the fitter relied on a\nsingle valve and a frozen plug of para-toluidine behind the valve, as\nthe steam had been removed from the tracing to this line, to seal the\ncontents. Shortly after the fitter left, the tank contents were\nreleased due to the failure of this isolation. The para-toluidine\noverflowed the bund wall and spread over the tank farm, contaminating a\nwide area with a solid layer of toxic material. The site emergency team\ntried to stop the tank emptying but failed despite their various\nefforts.",
        "Consequences": "This incident had no off-site impact to people or the environment. \n\nIt is estimated that 25 - 30 tonnes of para-Toluidine (PT) were released. The release was not contained by the spill bund so the PT spread across walkways to the east and west of the storage area and into the canal road, were it was contained with sand bags and solidified. \n\nNo individuals were injured during the incident.\nArea concerned - remarks:The site emergency team tried to stop the tank emptying but failed despite their various efforts. The para-toluidine overflowed the bund wall and spread over the tank farm, across walkways to the east and west of the storage area, and into the canal road, where it was contained with sand bags. A wide area was contaminated with a solid layer of toxic material. People - remarks:There were no injuries during the incident, but during the clean-up operation, blood tests taken from four employees of the contractors carrying out the removal of the solidified para-touluidine were found to have high levels of met haemoglobin and were taken to hospital. Three of them suffered symptoms of ill-health and two were detained overnight, where they were treated with oxygen before being released. No long-term ill-health effects have been identified.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "The site alarm system gave an audible warning message for the contingency. The onsite emergency team responded to the alarm. The following steps were taken to stem the flow of PT and mitigate the consequences of the release:\u00b7 Access to the local effluent pit was closed off.\u00b7 The entrance from the canal roadway was closed off with sand bags to prevent the spread of the PT. \u00b7 Attempts were made to close the valve from the local control panel but this was unsuccessful.\u00b7 Attempts were made to cool the flow using water and CO2 extinguishers thereby solidifying the PT but these were unsuccessful\u00b7 The emergency team planned to fit an 'outlet line pump blank' but this piece of equipment could not be found.\u00b7 An absorbent sock and wood shims where inserted directly into the flange but again this did not stop the flow. After 2 -3 hours, it appears that the flow slowed of its own accord&nbsp; to a sufficient level to allow the team to remove the air head to the valve and mechanically close it.Emergency measures - Remarks: When the incident occurred, attempts were made to stop the tank emptying and the leak spreading, but these were inadequate and unsuccessful. There were no injuries during the incident, but during the clean-up operation, blood tests taken from four employees of the contractors carrying out the removal of the solidified para-touluidine were found to have high levels of met haemoglobin and were taken to hospital. Three of them suffered symptoms of ill-health and two were detained overnight and treated with oxygen before being released. No long-term ill-health effects have been identified.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: \nPrevention - standards of isolation on site should be upgraded to\nensure that single valve isolation is not relied upon when carrying out\nmaintenance work in high hazard areas. \n\nMitigation - the emergency equipment (e.g. the 'outlet line pump\nblank') should be readily available and appropriately maintained at all\ntimes.\nMeasures to prevent recurrence: The company was asked to address the following issues identified during the investigation:1. The tank was not kept empty following the discovery of the fault on the pump.2. The tank was kept warm and not allowed to set.3. Impossibility of application of site isolation standards to physical hardware.4. History of pump failure on site.5. Specification of personal protection equipment for fitters was not adequate.6. Risk assessment of isolation was not adequate.7. Isolation procedures were not followed.8. Permit to work was not adequate.9. Freezing of para-toluidine lines was not adequate.10. Isolation of pump under repair was not adequate.11. Emergency measures to stop leakage were not adequate.12. The clean up team used water jetting in the heat of the day.13. The clean up team was not adequately trained to prevent exposure to para-toluidine when removing their personal protective equipment."

The explosion and subsequent fire in an acrylic acid intermediate tank killed one person and injured 36. The high temperature section which was not effectively cooled was formed in the upper section of the liquid stored in V-3138 and remained stagnant for a significant period of time. This has resulted in DAA formation and increased the liquid temperature further with the heat of dimerization. Since then, the liquid temperature reached the temperature which started the polymerization reaction. With the heat of polymerization reaction, the temperature increased even further. This caused V-3138 content to boil and built up V-3138 pressure until V-3138 started to crack. V-3138 content started to leak from the cracks, which caused the pressure to drop drastically and BLEVE occurred thereafter. As a result, V-3138 ruptured, scattered content ignited and caused the fire.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The investigation has concluded the following direct causes, which led into the explosion and fire of intermediate tank V-3138: Even though high temperature of rectifying column bottom liquid was building up inside V-3138, the fact that the circulation of Recycle to Top was not commissioned caused insufficient cooling to the tank liquid. This resulted in acrylic acid remaining stagnant for a significant period of time at high temperature. Although it was known to the company that DAA would form at a faster rate at high temperature, there was still insufficient recognition of the potential risk of heat of DAA formation which could increase the liquid temperature, and lead to this accident. Due to lack of thermometers and inadequate temperature monitoring, it was not possible to detect the abnormal condition until the polymerization proceeded. Failure in \u201cManagement of Change (MOC)\u201d The rule of MOC was established in 2004 at this plant. The testing conditions for the load up test were thought to be adjusted within the range of equipment capacity, the rectifying column load was within the operating range of the past track records and the liquid volume to store in V-3138 was within the tank\u2019s nominal capacity.",
        "Consequences": "Fatality: 1 (firefighter) Severely injured: 5 (2 firefighters and 3 employees) Moderately injured: 13 (8 firefighters, 1 police officer, and 4 employees) Lightly injured: 18 (14 firefighters, 1 police officer, and 3 employees) Total: 37 persons The tank involved was destroyed and its surrounding equipment, racks, piping, cables, etc., were damaged.",
        "Emergency response": "13:25, Operators started spraying water onto V-3138. 13:40, liquid level of V-3138 reached out-ofrange limit (84.8m3). The self fire fighting team was alerted. 14:00, the self fire fighting team started spraying water onto V-3138. 14:02, the public fire department was arrived. 14:35, V-3138 exploded.",
        "Lesson Learned": "An analysis of this accident provided perspective on the following technical and organisational lessons: The updating of operational documentation must strictly correspond to all process changes; A technical or procedural modification to a process, even minor in nature, can fundamentally alter the initial risk analysis and, with it, the design of safety barriers; Technician training and drills must also focus on infrequent and extraordinary phases, such as equipment testing; For each product displaying risks of ignition, decomposition or runaway reaction, the control parameters deemed critical, e.g. the outcome of a HAZOP analysis, must be subject to continuous monitoring by technical staff throughout all process stages; Regular communication with follow-up is necessary between the design, maintenance and operations teams."

        "Accident Description": "On 6 November 2012 at approximately 04:50, an explosion occurred in one of the company's batch reactors. A fire then spread towards the top of the building. According to the results of the investigation, molsidomine decomposition was the cause of the accident (molsidomine is an end product of the process and is not classified under Seveso legislation). Prior to commencing production in 2007, the company carried out tests to determine the decomposition temperature of pure molsidomine (151 \u00b0C). Given that the temperature of the process does not normally exceed 55 to 60 \u00b0C, the company believed the process operated under safe conditions. The accident ultimately occurred during the 9th production run. In reality, at the stage in the process at which the explosion occurred, 300 kg of molsidomine and 275 kg of pyridinium salts (product of the reaction between the solvent pyridine (R11) and HCl) remained in the reactor.The pyridine was fully distilled at the time of the explosion and only traces were left in the reactor. Tests carried out after the accident demonstrate that the decomposition temperature of this mixture (molsidomine + salts) is 91 \u00b0C. The TD24 safe handling temperature is 65 \u00b0C (there is no risk of explosion if heated for 24 hours) and the hazardous temperature begins at 75 \u00b0C (there is a risk of explosion if exposed to heat for 1 to 8 hours), while the reaction process takes 7 hours. The double-jacketed reactor was steam-heated and as a result it is likely that the temperature in some parts of it exceeded 75 \u00b0C (in the gas phase). The decomposition of the mixture could therefore begin and then sustain its own heatingin blobs onto the reactor wall in the gas phase. Overpressure destroyed the glass componentsof the reactor (and the rupture disk) and the blast wave spread throughout the reactor room. The fragile wall of the building was blasted away/destroyed which prevented damage being caused to the structure of the building. A few burning projectiles were propelled around the room but were very quickly put out by the emergency team and fire brigade. However, one burning projectile smashed through a glass panel in the corridor of the upper floor. This corridor was being used to store empty drums/IBCs and wooden palettes (there were no Seveso substances in this area). The fire therefore spread and caused great damage to the corridor. Given its high location (5th floor) and the fact that the exact contents of the corridor were not known (the explosions were, in fact, caused by the expansion of empty metal drums resulting from exposure to heat from the fire), it took some time to extinguish the fire. The fire in the corridor was finally out at approximately 09:00. As a result, this accident cannot be defined as a major accident as it did not involve any classified product.",
        "Causes of the accident": "\u2022\tThe decomposition temperature of pure molsidomine is 151 \u00b0C. The company therefore believed that they were under safe conditions since the temperature of the process did not exceed 60 \u00b0C. Tests carried out after the accident have shown that a risk of explosion could have already existed at 75 \u00b0C (for the mixture of molsidomine + salts). This temperature can be reached locally on the reactor walls.\n\u2022\tMost of the damage caused by the fire came from the stock of empty drums/IBCs and wooden palettes in the corridor of the building. There was a single glass panel between the reactor room and this corridor. \u2022\tThe reactor was equipped with two temperature sensors, one at the bottom (for the liquid phase) and one at the top (for the gas phase). The bottom sensor did not detect an increase in temperature because it was there that liquid was being mixed/cooled. The top sensor noted an abnormal increase in temperature more than an hour before the accident occurred. However, the operator was unable to see this temperature as it was not displayed. Given that at approximately 04:30 the operator had observed that the (bottom) temperature was displayed as normal (< 60 \u00b0C), he went on his break whilst this stage in the batch process finished. The (top) temperature continued to increase during this time (>100 \u00b0C before the explosion) which lead to the explosion at 04:50.",
        "Consequences": "Nobody was injured in the accident. Fortunately, at the time of the explosion, the operator had left the reactor room to take his break. It was only the production building and the production equipment in close proximity to the explosion/fire that were damaged. The fragile walls constituting the front of the building and the roof have had to be replaced as they were destroyed by the explosion. Some rooms were damaged but these will be fit for use again once they have been restored. The reactor and instrumentation equipment were also destroyed by the explosion and fire. No consequences arose outside the company's premises.",
        "Emergency response": "The emergency team and fire brigade responded quickly, notably because the fire station was close by. Their response consisted above all of extinguishing the burning solid objects (wooden palettes etc.) in the corridor of the 5th floor. The authorities were initially unaware that the fumes released by the fire were not toxic. It took some time before it became known that it was a fire fuelled simply by wooden palettes and empty drums/IBCs and did not involve dangerous substances. This slowed down the initial response.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The decomposition temperature of a pure product can be much higher than the decomposition temperature of the same product mixed with other substances. Prior to commencing production, tests should be carried out on the actual mixtures in order to reflect reality more closely. Following the accident, the company repeated the laboratory tests for all production processes that required them. Combustible materials (e.g. wooden palettes) must never be stored in a production building even if it does not contain dangerous substances. The company has created a storage area outside the building. The openings (the glass panels) between the reactor rooms on the fourth floor and the corridor of the fifth floor have also been removed. The operator should be able to see all measurements. The company has made sure that all measurements from the temperature sensors are displayed to the operator."

        "Accident Description": "On 15 April 2012 the plant fire service at a pig iron and crude steel production plant was called out in response to a gas alarm sounding on a CO warning device. In the area in question a CO warning device is affixed to a gas condensate reservoir in a blast furnace gas pipeline (the warning alarm sounds any time the fixed threshold of 200 ppm is exceeded). Hand-held measuring devices detected high fluctuation in the CO concentration, from 20 ppm up to 330 ppm. The on-call service, as required under internal contingency plans, was alerted. No faults were detected when checks were carried out of the gas condensate reservoirs and other installations located close by.\nAs the operation proceeded, the alarms on a further two CO warning devices sounded. However, when the emergency services arrived, no CO could be detected. The CO concentration at the site where the first alarm sounded also fell steadily until no CO could be detected. It is currently unclear how much gas escaped from the blast furnace.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The exact cause of the detected gas leak could not be identified. A wide range of possible causes was investigated, working together and in close collaboration with the district government. However, no clear explanation for the three gas alarms sounding simultaneously could be found.",
        "Consequences": "Hand-held measuring devices detected high fluctuation in the CO concentration, from 20 ppm up to 330 ppm. The on-call service, as required under internal contingency plans, was alerted.\n",
        "Emergency response": "- The police and fire brigade were alerted.\n- Neighbouring roads were sealed off by the police until approximately 3.30 p.m.\n- An emergency response was executed, involving all hazard safety services deployed.\n- The plant fire service issued a D2 alert.\n- The fire brigade provided assistance in taking measurements where the two subsequent gas alarms sounded. On-site:\n- The exit to the plant was sealed off and gatehouse evacuated.\n- Measurements were taken at the sites where the alarms sounded. Off-site:\n- Neighbouring roads were closed by the police until approximately 3.30 p.m.\n- Measurements were taken on neighbouring roads. - Neighbouring roads were sealed off by the police.\n- Measurements were taken by the fire brigade at the two subsequent sites where an emergency operation was carried out, with the assistance of the plant fire service supervisors.",
        "Lesson Learned": "As part of an upgrade to the gas warning devices, gas concentrations will be transmitted directly to a permanently manned station and a form of pre-alarm displayed locally in the permanently manned station will be installed.\nIn this way, it will be possible to establish detected gas concentrations below the alarm threshold at an early stage."

        "Accident Description": "The railcar loading station for vinylchloride monomer (VCM) of the plant consists of eight railcar connections (loading arms). Only four of these can be used at the same time.\nThe normal loading procedure is to fill eight railcars (first four, then the other four) and afterwards all eight railcars are moved out of the loading area in one movement with a locomotive.\nDue to a defect of the plants locomotive, it was temporarily replaced with a rented smaller locomotive, which was unable to pull eight full railcars at once.\nThe loading station is safeguarded with a derailing device, that is interlocked to ensure it is in place during loading. This should prevent entering the loading station with the locomotive during loading activities. This interlock was bypassed by the operators, so that after the first four railcars were full, these could be moved (with the smaller locomotive), while the other four railcars were being filled.\nDue to a miscommunication between the operators on November 23, 2018, the first and last four railcars were not uncoupled from each other, when the locomotive was used to pull away the first four filled railcars. So the locomotive moved the four full railcars and the four remaining railcars that were being filled over a distance of several meters.\nAs a result, the loading arms of two of the four connected railcars broke, releasing a big cloud of vinylchloride monomer, that was being pumped through the loading arms. The bottom valves on the railcars closed automatically as a result of the railhooks being pulled loose.\nThe vapour cloud triggered the gas detection in the storage bund next to the loading station, which automatically shut the bottom valves of all VCM storage spheres, preventing the further release of VCM. The time of the release was about 90 seconds, the estimated amount of VCM released is between 1.6 and 2.8 tonnes.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Bypass of interlock on derailing device\nDeviation of standard procedure\nMiscommunication\nInsufficient management of change for replacement of locomotive",
        "Consequences": "Release of vinylchloride monomer in the air",
        "Emergency response": "Plant evacuation\nUse of water cannons and water curtains by the intervention team",
        "Lesson Learned": "Gas detection should be located strategically around the loading area. The existing gas detection at the storage area managed to stop the leak successfully in a short time. However, the activation of this detection depended on the wind direction, which was in this case favorable.\nEmergency shutdown buttons should be available on all escape routes.\nThe existing railhooks managed to close off the railcars succesfully. It would be better if these railhooks were equipped with detection (for example pneumatically), interlocked to the loading operation.\nSafety interlocks (such as the derailing hook) should be constructed in a way that bypassing them is only possible with specialised tools.\nProvisions must be taken to allow for easy cooling of railcars with flammable liquified gasses on all sides. It is advisable to implement a fixed water spray system (\"deluge\").\nManagement of change procedures should also include changes of the used equipment and the procedures."

There were no level gauge and no high level alarm on the receiving tanks. Written pumping orders (written procedures, written instructions) had been given to and acknowledged by the crew of the ship. Beyond this reliance was placed on the crew of the ship to get it right (lack of control, lack of supervision).Accident arose because of human error - miscalculation.

        "Accident Description": "The accident:hydrogen chloride was released during emptying of a tank containing benzoyl chloride (CAS 98-88-4), the operation was being carried out in the context of securing the site after closing down the production activities.The accident is classified at level 2 of the international accident gravity scale, the classification is due to the fact that several persons were affected by the release that occurred during the accident.Even if the accident lies below the criteria set forward by the Seveso Directive,&nbsp; it is notified due to its relevance concerning the lessons to be learned from the occurrence. In fact the phases of partial or complete dismantling operations of an installation present hazards which have to be taken into account during the planning phase of these operations.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Benzoyl chloride (C6H5-COCl) is&nbsp; an acyl chloride. Its hydrolysis is strongly exothermic and forms benzoic acid (C6H5-COOH) and hydrogen chloride (HCL). A reaction occurs also with alcohols and forms an ester and release of HCl.This is what probably occurred when methanol (CH3OH) was added to&nbsp; the tank with a significant release of HCl ( estimated at 90 kg i.e. 55 m3 of hydrogen chloride per 100 l of methanol pumped into the tank and assuming a complete reaction). The reaction caused the heating of the mixture.A fault tree can be represented schematically as follows:Solid residues of benzoic acidProduct stored more than 3 years ----------&gt; emptying impossible ----------&gt; laboratory tests (but the pump was not suitable for pumping solids)Ignorance of the hazards (faulty hazard evaluation))----------&gt; addition of methanol but sampling not representative&nbsp; and distorted results ----------&gt;reaction of the products present in the tank and pressure rise ----------&gt; gas cloud over the dome and faulty joint----------&gt;the gas cloud drifted off-site due to the strong blustering wind, part of the cloud was abated ----------&gt;&nbsp; Inhabitants were affected",
        "Consequences": "According to the declarations of witnesses, an opaque cloud with fuzzy contours was seen&nbsp; above the installation and drifted towards the houses located some 150 m from the tank involved in the accident. The inhabitants suffered from eye burning. An older person affected was transported to hospital and maintained under observation for a day. The phenomenon lasted during a few minutes. The acid gas cloud released from the tank drifted following the wind direction but its dispersion was partly hindered by the buildings adjoining the storage area. There was no ecological damage to the river crossing the site.",
        "Emergency response": "When the accident occurred several alarms were triggered in the guard room, the guard alerted the onsite fire fighting station .The personnel attempted to abate the cloud by setting up a water curtain and by spraying the tank.The public emergency response services&nbsp; were&nbsp; alerted by neighbours of the installation who had observed an abnormal gas cloud and were suffering from burning eyes. The emergency response services arrived on the site approximately 10 minutes after having been called. The Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) was notified by the emergency response service of the fire brigade one hour after the accident. The management of the installation was not present on-site when the accident occurred. The management reached the installation at 13:15 h following an explicit request of the Classified Installation Inspectorate (DRIRE). The Onsite Contingency Plan (POI - Plan d'Op\u00e9ration Interne) was only activated by the operator&nbsp; 2 hours later.The emergency response services responded by sending the chemical emergency unit and several vehicles (pump-trucks and ambulances equipped to carry victims injured or asphyxiated ). The spray water collected in the retention ponds was evacuated to&nbsp; a specialised company for disposal.Sampling of hydrogen chloride was performed (with Dr\u00e4ger detector tube) by the emergency response services&nbsp; near the storage area and downwind at the outskirts of the premises. No abnormal situation was found 2 hours after the occurrence.The public emergency response operation was partially called off in the late afternoon.Immediate consequencesAfter sealing the leak in correspondence with the joint, no other leakage was visible on the tank the evening after the accident. The chemical reaction process had stopped and the system had returned to a stable condition. On request of the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) a continuous monitoring of the installations was set up and the mandatory presence of a management representative was&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; for the night and&nbsp; renewed during the following days. A tarpaulin was installed above the tank to protect the tank against atmospheric agents.The Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) requested the operator to prepare a technical report ( the request was also supported by&nbsp; an urgent prefectoral order) describing the securing works to be performed, the preventive measures to be taken concerning the safety of the operations as well as the necessary emergency&nbsp; response means. Before performing any other operation, the setting up of a new emptying procedure for the tank was requested, the procedure being subject to validation by a third party expert.Two distinct stages were defined: - on one hand preparatory works for securing the storage installation- on the other hand the emptying procedure itself with the cleaning of the tank, these procedures&nbsp; were subject to validation by a third party expert before approval by the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE).The operations foreseen comprised five phases:- Phase 1 - securing operation- Phase 2 - repair of the leakage point- Phase 3 - fluidisation and homogenisation- Phase 4 - emptying of the tank- Phase 5 - decontaminationThe first two phases were carried out on 19th March 2002. The following phases, were performed at the end of April 2002 in accordance with an expert report by INERIS&nbsp; and the transfer of the product to a centre for the disposal of hazardous waste was performed on 30th April 2002.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Following the event, the Prefect of Val d'Oise issued an urgent prefectoral order dated 13th February 2002, applying article L 512-7 of the Environmental Regulations obliging the operator to take measures&nbsp; for cleaning and securing the installations, for dismantling the installations, for avoiding the recurrence of a similar event considering that a storage installation for hazardous substances is present on the site. This prefectoral order obliged the company to issue and submit for approval the procedures prior to the emptying operations of the benzoyl chloride tank and of another tank containing aluminium chloride (CAS 7446-70-0); the procedures were subject to validation by a third party expert.The Classified Installations Inspectorate also requested the operator to submit&nbsp; an accident report. The analysis of the accident report and the on-site investigation have shown the following failures:- failure to notify the accident to the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE)- absence of a management representative on the site and failure in managing the organisation and decision chain with respect to the safety issues- late release of the onsite contingency plan- organisational failure of the operator in managing the immediate consequences of the accident- corrosion of the external tank wall- overflow alarm of the tank not connected to the control room- bad condition of the joint on the man-hole flange of the tank- carrying out of the emptying procedure presenting hazards to the personnel and the environment consequent to a faulty hazard assessment which led to the use of incompatible substances and a wrong evaluation of the consequences of such an operation.- missing hazard labelling on the methanol container- bad condition of the fire fighting hoses on the site- The validity of a certain number of Dr\u00e4ger detector tubes for HCl had expired in 1998"

The explosion was caused by the ignition of a vapor cloud of hydrocarbons (light naphtha, propane and butane). The possible source of the hydrocarbons release was the rupture of a 10\" pipe at the bottom of the Naphtha Stabilizer Tower. For about 1 - 1.5 minutes the cloud spread in a large area of the unit and was then ignited by some sources of ignition, exploding. The cloud explosion was then followed by a fire that was confined to the point where the leakage occurred and was totally extinguished at 11.20 a.m. There was an immediate information to the refinery fire brigade and the other refinery  (there is an agreement among the three Refineries to help one each other in case of accident). Five minutes later, the fire vehicles started arriving to Refinery Installations. Totally, there were 23 fire vehicles and 150 firemen plus the personnel of the refinery. One man was killed by the explosion and 33 people hospitalized with burns on their skin.

        "Accident Description": "Two workers were asked to change the piping and support of a feed line into an intermediate storage vessel for hydrochloric acid. The line was opened, and as they started grinding on the line support, an explosion occurred. The flame propagated back into the tank, causing a second explosion inside. The tank ripped open and was catapulted into the air, killing both victims in the process. The explosion was caused by the unexpected presence of a considerable amount of hydrogen in the tank. The hydrogen was formed in a reaction of traces of metal powder and the hydrochloric acid, and must have accumulated over a period of two months. The traces of metal powder were present in the acid feed to the storage tank. This was the result of an incomplete reduction reaction in an upstream reactor. In that reactor, the metal powder was used to remove traces of metaloxides from the acid. Since 2009, the reactor was being operated at a lower temperature than the process was designed for, resulting in a lower reaction rate. Due to the lower reaction rate, traces of unreacted metal powder were present in the feed sent from the reactor to the intermediate storage vessel. In the storage vessel, the reaction continued, producing small amounts of hydrogen, which accumulated in the top. When the piping on top was opened, some hydrogen escaped and was ignited by the sparks of the grinding. The reactor has a ventilation system, designed to remove the hydrogen generated in the reduction reaction. The storage vessel did not. The possibility of hydrogen formation or presence in the intermediate storage vessel was never identified during risk assessment studies of the installation. The influence of the operating temperature on the reaction process was never documented, and no safe operating window for the reactor temperature was determined. Even though Management of Change procedures were in place, no risk assessment was made for the change in operating temperature of the reactor in 2009. A work permit was granted for the execution of the piping modification. Since no flammable vapours were expected, no explosion prevention measures were taken.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "The operating temperature of the reactor was lowered in 2009, but the impact of this change on the process was never analysed. Management of change procedures were in place, but not followed.\nA risk analysis and assessment was made of this installation, using the HAZOP methodology, but the possibility of hydrogen formation in the storage vessel was never identified. The risk assessment team did not focus sufficiently on the chemical process aspects of the installation.\nThe safe operating window for the process parameters in the reactor was not determined.",
        "Consequences": "Two workers were killed by the explosion.",
        "Emergency response": "Both victims died instantly and there was no fire.The direct emergency response was limited to neutralising the hydrochloric acid.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Risk assessment must be thorough, assessment methodologies (such as HAZOP) must be followed in detail. Risk assessment should be conducted by a multidisciplinary team who have a thorough knowledge of both chemical process and mechanical installation. Management of Change procedures must also be applied to process changes, such as changes in operating temperature. The safe operating window of process parameters (pressure, temperature, flow rate...) must be determined and documented."

The released ethylene caught fire. The fire only burned for a couple of minutes until all ethylene was released through the 124 mm diameter ruptured pipe. Interlock systems had blocked connections to other equipment immediately after the explosion.\nThe site intervention team started firefighting and cooling down of the equipment. When the fire brigade arrived (15-20 minutes later) the incident was completely under control and no further interventions were needed.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "The decomposition reaction was caused by incomplete purging of the installation, leaving an air pocket in a line.\nThe air pocket remained between 2 closed valves. One of these valves normally stays open after shut-down and allows the part to be purged. During the shut-down this valve was closed during an interlock test and left closed. The operator performing the purging operation assumed is was still as left at shut down.\nThe purging operation was done on the basis of operator knowledge, without an instruction.\nNo checklists were used to guide the start-up process and to mark the completion of start up phases.\n\nInadequate training of emergency procedures:\nThere are different emergency buttons available, an emergency stop which stops the installation and isolates all major inventories of ethylene and a dump system to evacuate certain vessels to the (small) flair.\nThe difference between the systems and when to use which was not understood properly by the operators.\nThey used the emergency stop (isolating the decomposition reaction) instead of the dump. Dumping the high pressure separator to the flare could have prevented the rupture of the pipe.",
        "Consequences": "Apart from the ruptured pipe the explosion caused structural damage to the nearby platform and damaged weaker construction elements (doors, plastic wall panels) in a wider radius (100-200 m) mostly on-site.\n\nParts of the pipe had to be replaced due to the high temperature they experienced during the incident.",

        "Accident Description": "On 7th September 2010, a fire occurred in the final assembly building generating a series of explosions seriously damaging the building and damaging a specific part of the area. The incident was caused by the ignition of an 81 mm HE M512A1 mortar round during the final packing operation.One side of the pallet assembly was filley with 54 projectiles of 81mm. The problem occured while closing the transport containers of the mortar rounds. The mortar rounds are transported in plastic containers that hold 3 mortar rounds in seperate tubes. The operator experienced difficulties in loading the round into the containers and closing the container caps.The mortar round sometimes protruded more than normal from the plastic container and this made it more difficult to fit the retaining cap, to rotate it and to align it correctly. A gap remained between the container and the cap.The operator found that striking the retaining cap of the container with a mallet was enough to align it and to allow the cap to be locked in position. According to the operator, the incident occurred when he struck the remaining cap with a mallet due to it being difficult to align and rotate.This was not the first time that the operator used the mallet to close the cap. One of the two operators at the packing operation had done the loading operation before but could not be considerd highly experienced since he was drafted in to performe this operation from another area of the site (machining).",
        "Causes of the accident": "The primary cause was that the operator have strike the retaining cap of the container with a mallet to align it and to allow the cap to be locked in position.\u200bThe poor and out of specification neoprene compressibility and incorrectly seated sleeve explain why containers were difficult to close.Several tests have been made to determine how a mallet shock through the container cap initiated the primary cartridge and how the propulsion system of the mortar round could be ignited. Based on all test results, it's not possible that the mallet impact on the container cap caused the primary charge to ignite. The identified root cause is the ignition of the primer of the propulsion system of a mortar round by direct impact with the mallet onto the anvil. As all the containers of the pallet were filled with mortar rounds, it was demonstrated that it is highly probable that the operator directly but unintentionally hit the adjacent round during the closing container cap operation and made the primer function.Secondary causes are related with behavior, formation and management reaction on the operator's reports of problems (operators have already said to the management that problems existed with the containers but nothing was changed and they continued to use a mallet).",
        "Consequences": "Damages to building and area onsite.No dead and no real injury : 2 persons chocked and one blasted were sent to hospital but were released immediatelyOne school was evacuated.One speedway was closed during some hours.",
        "Emergency response": "The two operators evacuated seeing the beginning of fire.The site was evacuated.External fire brigade was onsite but could'nt attack fire because of danger. They 've waited until all the projectiles have exploded (counting deflagrations).

        "Lesson Learned": "The incident analysis has demonstrated that the root cause is human factor and mainly a behaviour/training problem (mallet shock on the igniter). So, all the people working in energetic processes have received two days training on behavior and safety with energetic products.More attention has to be given to reports of problems coming from workers: operators had already said to the management that problems existed with the containers but nothing was changed.The risks assemsments will be followed by implementation of actions and modifications of the work instructions and control documents in particular taking account the change notification and the integration of safety instructions.\u00a0The design and loading process of the projectile in its container should be reviewd to ensure the ammunition is easy to pack and to ensure it is well maintained and safe during transportation, vibration or shock."

        "Accident Description": "At a Seveso-classified petrochemical plant, a pipe supplying air to a steam production boiler exploded at 3:40 pm, triggering a few seconds later a 2nd and more powerful explosion on a duct used to recover volatile organic compounds (VOC). The explosion and debris from the duct caused a fire outbreak on both a duct cyclofilter and a 1,000-litre vinyl acetate tank at the base of a distillation column, as well as a leak on the pipe feeding a 1-m\u00b3 oxygen tank.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The polyethylene (PE) polymerisation unit had been modified 2 years prior to the accident; moreover, a system for treating the VOC stemming from degassing of this unit (cooling and condensation of the heaviest compounds) had been installed. The compounds remaining in a gaseous state (ethylene, vinyl acetate) were then piped to a fan, with a flow rate of 25 to 50 kg/hr. At the fan outlet, these compounds entered a VOC recovery duct (L: 300 m, d: 1.5 m). Initially, this duct solely transported a mix composed of air and a small proportion of degassed VOC from the PE bead storage silos (< 10% of the lower flammable limit). The site's 2 boilers, which were supplying steam to both the site's steam cracker and flare in order to remove black smoke, burned the gaseous mix being fed through the duct. This process enabled eliminating a large portion of the VOC generated by the polyethylene production process.\nThe investigation conducted by the operator revealed that a liquid hydrocarbon mix (solvent and vinyl acetate) had formed inside the polymerisation VOC recovery pipe before being propelled by the fan into the boiler supply duct, where this mix accumulated. An inflammable atmosphere had thus been created in the pipe section adjacent to the boilers. On the day of the accident, this atmosphere caused an explosion in the air inlet to one of the boilers; this blast spread to the duct section near the fan. Such a scenario of driving liquid VOC at the degassing outlet of extruding machines had not been anticipated in the safety reports prior to modifying the polymerisation unit.",
        "Consequences": "Rescue services, notified ahead of time, transported to hospital 5 employees, 2 of whom with hearing problems and the other 3 suffering from shock due to the blast; 1 subcontractor was examined at the site's infirmary. The VOC duct was destroyed over some 100 m. The boilers were damaged; the cracking furnaces had to be inspected, with their heating tubes needing to be changed due to the sudden shutdown without steam. The damage and extended downtime generated economic losses on the order of several million \u20ac, not counting the redundancies caused by plant renovations.",
        "Emergency response": "The internal emergency plan was activated at 3:47 pm; the plant's siren sounded and the 250 employees were evacuated, as were personnel from neighbouring firms.Onsite first responders extinguished the fire sources using 2 foam nozzles and 4 vehicles; they left the oxygen tank empty, but set up nozzles and a water curtain to dilute the leak. The situation was brought under control by 4:15 pm, and the emergency plan was lifted at 6:42 that evening.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The operator proceeded by building a VOC treatment system dedicated to the polymerisation unit, which was designed to be independent of the storage silo VOC treatment facility."

        "Accident Description": "The fire was detected by the operator further to a verification call from the fire brigade (which had received a notification from a car driver). As the operator approached the storage tank, the roof was already fully ablaze.\nAll gas valves linked to the incoming and outgoing gas pipelines were then closed by the operator. An alarm on the operator\u2019s mobile phone was triggered via the biogas facility\u2019s alarm and reporting system but only owing to the automatic shutdown of the combined heat and power plants (BHKW).No maintenance and/or repair work nor any inspection rounds were being carried out when the fire began. The agitator in the tank was switched off.\nWhen the fire brigade arrived, the roof was already almost entirely burnt. The fire-fighting work was limited to the edges of the tank, as the fire had burnt itself out owing to the lack of any further gas flow and combustible materials.Surrounding buildings and tanks/gas storage facilities were not affected thanks to the substantial distances between the buildings and the favourable wind conditions.\nSafety measures:Stop the flow of gas to the gas storage facility, shut down the motors automatically and disconnect the gas pipeline from the motors and from the gas preparation and compressors.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Since damage from a storm in mid-February 2022, the gas storage roof on the storage tank in question had been operating with a 40&nbsp;cm-long tear along a weld seam on a metal plate designed for the installation of belts to stabilise the roof at the highest point on the weather protection membrane.\nAccording to the statement given by a specialist biogas plant, the tear could not be repaired on site, so that the storm damage (in insurance terms) had caused a total loss. A new weather protection membrane was required in order for the inflatable roof to function correctly again which, in agreement with the insurer, was also ordered in good time. However, owing to supply bottlenecks, high utilisation rates by biogas firms and the need for favourable weather conditions, it was not possible to change the membrane in good time.\nAs the gas storage membrane was found to be still intact and airtight following an inspection by a specialist firm, it was decided, in consultation with the biogas specialist and the insurance company, to continue operation of the gas storage facility despite the existence of the tear. According to the specialist firm, this was possible if the gas pressure within the gas storage facility was constantly maintained and all three ventilation fans inflating the roof continued in operation.\nOn this basis, the operator has continued to run the gas storage facility in emergency mode with extra outlay (e.g. increased checks on the hose clamp). No notification was made to the Labour Inspectorate (GAA).\nAt the time of the incident, a new membrane was already on the premises and the date of installation had been agreed with the company performing the work for 22&nbsp;June 2022.\nA few days before the incident, the operator had noticed an increase in gas consumption, however this was not traced back to a possible leak in the gas storage membrane, and instead the amount of input material was increased.\nIt may be assumed that the \u2018increased gas consumption\u2019 was already due to a leak in the gas storage membrane.It may also be assumed that owing to the insufficient internal pressure within the gas storage facility, the gas storage membrane was no longer taut and that there was therefore increased contact with the weather protection membrane.In this context, a static charge could have built up on the membrane surfaces. It is highly likely that this produced a spark which ignited the probable (new) leakage of gas through the gas storage membrane.\nNote: The actual cause of the leakage through the gas storage membrane cannot subsequently be established. This may have occurred as a result of the higher internal gas pressure due to early summer temperatures, or as a result of the increased movement of the membrane against the outer membrane close to the metal plate (mechanical damage).",
        "Consequences": "Gas storage facility roof (inflatable roof) completely destroyed. Costs: EUR&nbsp;80,000.",
        "Emergency response": "Disconnection of the gas supply, controlled burning off of the biogas. Extinguishing with water.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Even with an irreparable tear (with leakage) in the weather protection membrane alone, the gas storage facility roof (weather protection membrane and gas storage membrane) needs to be completely removed and the gas storage roof must therefore be taken out of operation.\nThe inappropriate operation of an installation must in principle be considered in a separate risk assessment, in this case, the emergency operation of the gas storage facility and its protection against explosions.The resulting findings and measures must be implemented and followed up by the operator. In this case, increased checks of the edges of the tank and the hose clamp had been laid down as a measure.However, these were obviously insufficient in this case, as regular manual gas measurements in the area of the tear and even a visual inspection of the membrane in the areas concerned were not possible.The only logical measure would have been to take the gas storage facility out of operation."

        "Start Date": "1987-03-22 07:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "1987-03-22 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:The morning was fine and cold with only a slight breeze.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A control valve on the liquid line between the HP and the LP Separators was opened in error and the liquid allowed to drain. High pressure hydrogen passed uncontrolled into the closed LP Separator which had limited pressure relief capacity. It overpressurised rupturing at an estimated pressure of 50 bar. The explosion disintegrated the separator and also damaged other vessels and pipes. Released flammable substances were ignited resulting in jet-fires.The hydrocracker unit was commissioned in the early 1970's. The potential for high pressure gas breakthrough into the LP separator was recognized in the design and the flow control valves in the line from the HP separator to the LP separator had provided to automatically close should liquid level in the HP Separator reach a critical pre-determined low point. The safety system was arranged to operate from either of a pair of low level magnetic float switches mounted on a bridle tube attached to the HP Separator. In a safety audit and in a review of pressure relief capacity within the hydrocracker complex which were carried out in 1975, the operator of the refinery concluded that high pressure gas breakthrough into the LP Separator would not arise because there was a safety trip actuated by low liquid levels.As a consequence the pressure relief valve on the LP Separator was sized only for fire engulfment on the vessel and was of comparatively small size. Throughout the 1970's the output of the hydrocracker was limited by a series of operational problems. By the early 1980's these were mostly overcome and throughput started to rise to exceed the design capacity of 23,000 barrels/day. At these high flow rates it was discovered that the liquid in the HP Separator became very turbulent. The rapidly changing liquid levels caused spurious trips of the control valve which in turn caused severe operational difficulties. The low liquid level control valve trip system also lost favour for various other reasons. For example frequent blockages of the pipework leading to the level detectors caused by build up of hard carbon residue and by the solidification of waxy liquids in cold weather. The system was unreliable and therefore was distrusted. Furthermore trips would be over-ridden prior to shut-down so that residual liquid in the HP separator could be emptied. At low throughputs or during standby operation trips would also be over-ridden so that the valves could be opened to allow liquid remaining in the line from the HP separator to be blown clear to prevent accumulation of solidifying wax. As a consequence, in the early 1980's the control valve trip was removed and not replaced. It was left to the operators to detect dangerous low levels and close the valves when they judged it appropriate. Removal of the safety system was authorized at operations supervisor level. Maintenance and instrument engineering managers were aware of the situations and turned a blind eye to it.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:A control valve on the liquid line between the HP and the LP Separators was opened in error and the liquid allowed to drain. High pressure hydrogen passed uncontrolled into the closed LP Separator which had limited pressure relief capacity. It overpressurised rupturing at an estimated pressure of 50 bar.CAUSES:The accident occurred because of an operator error (due to both the insufficient training of the operator and to the inappropriate procedures) in opening the control valve on the liquid line from the HP to the LP separator without noticing that the liquid contents in the HP vessel was draining away. Alarms did not operate because they had been previously disconnected without taking into account the decrease in safety. The main reason for the disconnection of the alarms was due to avoid operational difficulties because of the insufficient design capacity of the plant.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:8 people were directly involved in the explosion and the subsequent fire (1 person was killed by explosion). The smoke from the fire did not affected the locality. The number of people put at risk by the missiles thrown by the LP separator explosion were about 200. MATERIAL LOSS:The accident caused extensive damage to vessels, pipework and buildings within the hydrocracker complex (the cost of rebuilding of the hydrocracker has been estimated in about 7 MECU).Outside the establishment, damages occurred in an adjacent factory (rupture of a steam line and damages to a building caused by a large fragment of metal through the roof).The cost of this damage has been estimated to be about 0.007 MECU.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OTHER:A small radioactive source, part of a level detection unit, was lost in the blast. It is presumed to have landed in its heavy container on deep mud flats to buried to a considerable depth. It presents absolutely no danger to anyone.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA:The approximate extent of broken windows and cladding and the points were the missiles had thrown are shown on a map attached to the Original Report. The effects of the LP separator burst were equivalent to those of an explosion of 90 kg of TNT.Disruption of community life: Outwith the hydrocracker unit, the effects of the explosion were not severe, except for one nearby factory were a steam line was ruptured and a large metal fragment was thrown through the roof of a building. The smoke from the fire did not affect the locality.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Before evacuating the control room, operator initiated the emergency shut-down and venting system of the hydrocracker unit. The on-site emergency procedure was activated. This included the shut-down of the entire refinery, the evacuation of non-essential personnel, the mobilization of the refinery fire brigade and the call on-site of engineering management staff. The extensive refinery fire fighting system was quickly brought into use.The area major incident control committee (comprising Police, Fire Brigade and representatives from major companies in the area) was called into operation to co-ordinate the emergency measures. Fire brigades from Central Scotland attended. Supplies of equipment essential for fire fighting were brought on-site from companies in the locality under a mutual aid system. EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Road blocks were set up. Occupiers of neighbouring factories were asked to inspect their sites for damages. It was not necessary to evacuate any housing.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident the following measures were established:\n1- during the rebuilding of the hydrocracker, a full pressure relief on the LP separator, as well as improved instrumentation and fail-safe shut-off valves in series with level-control valves to be included;\n2- rigorous procedures to be adopted in order to drain the HP separator of liquid as shut-down;\n3- the systems for reporting plant defects, for testing interlocks and trips, for authorising equipment changes and for training operators have been tightened up;\n4- routine audits to be carried out rigorously. \n\nSenior management were taking a much closer interest in the safety performance of refinery departments.Useful references: The effects of the LP separator burst was estimated to be equivalent to those caused by an explosion of 90 kg of TNT."

In these rooms the foam extinguishing equipment and the electric operation equipment pertaining to the storage of mineral oil products are kept. According to the indications of the operator, chemicals, solvents and similar substances were not stored in the cellar rooms. Investigations on the premises established that between the basement of the office building and the tank storage hollow pipes, housing electric leads for the tank storage, were laid underground. In the particular case there are two lines of several hollow pipes each which lead from the basement of the office-building towards the tank storage and end under a platform. Also several hollow pipes coming from the vault manholes of the underground tanks end in this area. Electric cables are laid too in these hollow pipes to the vault manholes. The inspection established that none of these hollow pipes was sealed. Measurements during the investigation on the premises found explosive mixtures in the connecting pipes between the vault manhole and the platform as well as in the area under the platform even several days after the explosion. It has to be assumed that the explosion was caused by explosive mixtures which could reach the basement of the office-building through the unsealed hollow pipes and ignited there through the burner of the heating-installation. Six persons were injured through the explosion and had to be hospitalised. Consistent material loss was caused. Two persons claimed for damages. Measurement of the Fire-brigade at the fire source indicated higher concentrations of benzene, toluene, and hexane. Toluene and hexane are stored in the tank storage, whereas benzene is not. Due to the dimensions of the explosions it has to be assumed that a large amount of explosive mixture had to be involved. It is not clear which kind of chemicals were released and led to the explosion. However there is no evidence of overflowing or leakage of chemicals. No over-ground leakage could be found in the tank installation. On the basis of the investigations leakages in the underground piping system or in the underground tanks cannot be excluded.",

Employees outside&nbsp; the building perceived a blow just before the explosion. A flame several metres high was visible for some seconds at the exit of a chimney connected with the reactor rupture disk (calibrated at 0.5 bar) that burst, allowing the decompression of the reactor.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The synthesis operation had already been performed several times over 2 years.A material balance has demonstrated that the flow of imide compound transferred in the reactor was 8 to 9 times higher than foreseen. The operators could control this flow by regulating the number of pulsations of the dosing pump by means of a regulating screw and by acting on two manual valves located upstream of the pump. After the accident,&nbsp; the dosing&nbsp; pump was found to be regulated for a high flow and the two upstream manual valves were completely open.The reduction of an imide compound by sodium tetrahyddroborate in an \"ether\" type solvent medium is a hazardous reaction. Sodium tetrahyddroborate and Aluminium trichloride can decompose in presence of water, even if in trace quantities, forming eventually hydrochloric acid or hydrogen.When the accident occurred significant quantities of hydrogen were formed by the runaway reaction and were not absorbed by the reaction medium. The ignition of the gas may have been caused by static electricity in the reactor, a hot spot or&nbsp; the presence of diborane and water traces.The process instructions did not consider the flow regulations to be performed during transfer&nbsp; operations. These flow regulations were left to the know-how of the operators.The workers who were working at the reactor when the accident occurred were experienced with the exception of the worker who performed&nbsp; the imide compound transfer for the first time.The unit worked discontinuosly and was essentially operated manually. Considering the hazards releated to the reaction, the equipment has to be absolutely reliable and there has to be enough personnel to control the functioning of the equipment in completely safe conditions. These conditions were not guaranteed the day of the accident because:- 2 pumps with different flow capacity could be used for transfer operation, but&nbsp; no flow control meter was provided.- there were no safety or devices to alert the operators in case of a drift of the operating parameters (high flow, high pressure in the reactor,)- the unit was not equipped with remote control valves allowing the reactors to be isolated rapidly. The reactors could not be discharged rapidly, a \"neutralisation of the reacting medium was impossible.- the installation was brittle due to glass components.",
        "Consequences": "4 of 8 persons present in the workshop were burned or suffered from respiratory problems and were hospitalised.\nThe material damage was estimated at 14.000.000 FF - 2.100.000 EURO\n",
        "Emergency response": "The emergency services evacuated the casualties.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The following technical improvements have been made in the workshop:- measures on the parameters directly influencing he synthesis (substitution, automatic memorisation of the data, automatons with precise calibration)- check of all rupture disks- computerisation of the process control system (particularly of the alarm system)- installation of mobile dosing pumps with calibrated flows for specific use- control of the stirring speed- back-fitting of the electrical system- identification of the substances by means of colour codes- updating of the operating procedures and instructions- validating the equipment for every specific synthesis process.- upgrading of personnel training (realisation of individual files, permanent training programme)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "

        "Causes of the accident": "The explosion was caused by an explosive decomposition of nitrous oxide vapour in the tank. The decomposition of the vapour was initiated by the shaft of one of the pumps of the road tanker, which had overheated in one of its bearings. The decomposition must have propagated through the piping system to the tank. The main reason for overheating was the lack of cooling due to inadequate filling with liquid nitrous oxide. Due to inadequate working instructions it is well possible that the pumps were inadequately cooled before they were started. As a result, the pumps were filled with gaseous nitrous oxide.",
        "Consequences": "Eleven employees, among whom the driver of the truck, suffered minor injuries as a result of projected debris.The company and several buildings in the area sustained heavy damage.

The safety\norganisation has not been evaluated as a whole during the\ninvestigation. Interview with the truck driver indicates that he\nfollowed the specified procedure for loading the tank, except for not\nflushing the vapour return system. Evaluation of the specified\nprocedure for loading shows that the instructions are not very\ndetailed. It is possible that the pumps were not sufficiently cooled\nbefore the filling procedure started. Furthermore, instruction to truck\ndrivers is given only once.

        "Causes of the accident": "Gasket of a  valve (bellows)On 26/01/1998, in a liquefied gas supply plant-the failure of a overflow valve caused an uncontrolled release of about 150 l of liquid butane.At the time of the event, the entire plant was inoperative. The liquid gas feed pumps were inoperative too, so that at the external temperature conditions (approx. -5 C\u00b0) the pressure on the overflow valve was only the static pressure of the liquid gas pipe. Therefore the overflow valve opening function was not activated.The characteristics of the damage (a crack with a length of 12 mm in the longitudinal direction of the bellows) together with an evaluation of the local situation as well as the situation in the establishment indicate that the most probable cause is a imperfect manufacture or a defect in the material.",

        "Lesson Learned": "Since the failure of a  bellows used to seal a valve cannot be excluded, a secondary protection should be present. Such a secondary protection against the release of substances can be realised structurally by a supplementary gasket on the valve spindle (valve shaft) or by a gas-proof spring housing shell.\nThe required safety and reliability of overflow / control valves could be guaranteed by a component test, similar to a safety valve test."

        "Accident Title": "Mass explosion of fireworks warehouse",
        "Start Date": "2000-05-13 15:25:00",
        "Finish Date": "2000-05-13 15:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident started with a fire. 3 Explosions occurred. Water contamination cannot be excluded.A fire started in the repackaging area. The fire jumped across to other storage rooms and eventually caused a mass explosion of the stored fireworks.The process of escalation that lead to the disaster started in the repackaging area C2. The cause of the initial fire in this area has not been clarified. Suggested causes are: arson, auto-ignition of a so-called flash-cord, short circuiting of an improvised electricity conduit in C2 or the (illegal) handling/using of fireworks on May 13. The fire was not noticed until external effects occurred. When the fire brigade arrived at the scene, the fire had probably been going on for at least 25 minutes. By that time several fires had started in the area, caused by ejected fireworks. At a certain point in time, a fire started in a triangle between two containers and the concrete fencing of the site. Even after the fire in C2 was brought under control, smoke and later flames and ignited fireworks were detected from the adjacent bunker C4. A suggested scenario how the fire spread to this bunker is that it passed through the 7 centimeter diameter water-pipe lead-through in the wall between C2 and C4. Consequently, the fire brigade detected the fire in the triangle between the two containers (E2 and E15) and the concrete fence. Attempts to extinguish this fire were complicated by the inaccessability of the triangle. At this moment the fire had probably already spread to the contents of container E2. This may be concluded from the fact that shortly after the fire brigade had started extinguishing the fire in the triangle, they observed signs of fire in container E2. Shortly afterwards, container E2 exploded. This explosion caused a large flame in the direction of the central storage. However, this has probably not been the main factor in the following escalation. Ejected heavy fireworks from E2 exploded in front of the MAVO boxes, probably struck through the doors of these boxes and ignited its contents. Within one minute after the explosion of container E2, the MAVO boxes exploded rapidly one by one, starting with M7. This mass explosion is probably mainly due to the heavy class of the fireworks, in combination with the small dampening between the MAVO boxes. M7 probably contained fireworks of class 1.1. Its explosion had a TNT equivalent of circa 800 kg and was accompanied by a shock wave and a fire ball of 85 meters in diameter. Little more than a minute after the explosion of the MAVO boxes the final explosion took place, destroying bunker C11 and the rest of the bunker complex. The remaining containers exploded almost simultaneously. It is assumed that the ejected fireworks from the explosion of the MAVO boxes and/or the fireball initiated the explosion in C11. The doors of the bunkers had probably been destroyed by the previous explosion. The explosion of the other bunkers of the central storage was either initiated by ejected fireworks, or by the heat from the explosion in C11. The time interval between the explosions of the separate bunkers was so small that they were perceived as one. This final explosion had a TNT-equivalent of about 4 to 5 tonnes.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The company did not meet many of its legal obligations. The company stored more fireworks than it had obtained permits for, and the majority of these fireworks were of a much heavier class than was permitted. Fireworks were present in the repackaging area where the fire first started, in which area no fireworks were permitted to be present when no work was being performed, as was the case on May 13. The water-pipe lead-through between the repackaging area and the adjacent bunker C4 was of a nature which allowed fire to jump across. Two containers with no permits had been added in 1999, one of these two containers (E15) formed a side of the triangle in which fireworks ejected from the repackaging area and/or the adjacent bunker started a fire. That triangle was, due to the way in which this container had been positioned, nearly closed off and difficult to access. The part of the terrain in this triangle had not been kept sufficiently clean to prevent the fire from spreading.",
        "Consequences": "Area concerned - Remarks: \nThe surroundings of the\nsite were divided into two sections: the so-called inner ring counted\n4163 inhabitants. The outer ring counted 5724 inhabitants.\n\nPeople - Remarks: 18 people (among who 4 of the 24 firemen at he site) were killed instantly, 3 persons were reported missing. Five months later another victim died in hospital. It is assumed that the missing persons also died in the disaster. 947 people were registered as being injured, 527 of them were treated in hospital. Ecological harm - Remarks: Several hours after the explosion measurements of relevant substances (including asbestos) were started. Measurements were repeated over the following two weeks. The results show that the maximum daily intake for human exposure has not been exceeded for nearly every relevant dangerous substance in air. Health monitoring of victims and emergency personnel show no consistent elevation of dangerous substances in blood and urine samples. It is therefore assumed that environment and public health have not been endangered by exposure to dangerous substances after the explosion.\nNational heritage loss - Remarks: National Museum Twenthe was damaged.Material loss - Remarks: Total material costs are estimated to be at least 1.000.000.000 guilders. 1250 persons have lost their houses. A number of them also lost all of their possessions. About 10,000 people were forced to spend at least one night elsewhere.\nDisruption of community life: Communication networks were overheated for several hours after the explosion. 400 houses are demolished or severely damaged. The community is\ndisrupted. It is assumable that heavy metals from the fireworks have\ncome into the environment.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "The on-site systems are not exactly known yet. External services: Rescue operations by firemen and other rescue services. The area was evacuated for 3 days, the area in the near surroundings is still evacuated. A team of specialists has come to the area to identify the deaths. From the very beginning of the rescue operations, German rescue services assisted the Dutch rescue services. An independent board for accident investigation is being formed to investigate the cause of the accident (they also take into account: legislation, governmental services, permits, regulatory bodies, emergency measures taken, audits, procedures etc.). Decontamination (asbestos, personal safety equipment). The municipality provided psychological help, financial support and new housing for the people.Emergency measures - Remarks: Around 15.00 reports of fire near the Grolsch brewery reached the police. At 15.03 the police arrived at the site, fire brigade followed at 15.08 and the first ambulance arrived at 15.16. By now a large crowd of spectators was assembling, attracted by the spectacle of the exploding fireworks. Police and ambulance personnel decided to keep the public at distance and, with some difficulty, managed to clear the Tollensstraat. Shortly afterwards, at 15.36 the final explosion took place. The fire brigade suffered heavy losses: 4 fire men were missing, several more were injured and all of their equipment was destroyed. As a result hardly any attempts to extinguish the fires were made during the first 40 minutes after the explosions. The many small fires in the area developed into an sea of fire. During the next hours contingency plans were set into action. Fire brigades and medical assistance were called in from other parts of the country and Germany. The last fires were put out on May 15, 02.00. Emergency facilities for the treatment of wounded and shelters for people who lost their houses were organised. The search and registration for missing persons was organised. Arrangements have been made to compensate the victims for their material losses. Psychological follow-up care is still being provided.Seveso II duties  - remarks: \nWritten safety\nregulations had been made available to all employees. These included a\nsmoking prohibition, regulations for wearing cotton clothing,\nregulations for handling boxes of firework during loading and\nunloading, check on the use of personal protection devices and the use\nof fire extinguishers. Nearly all employees had followed specific\ntraining for working with fireworks.\nOfficial action taken - legal action: Public prosecution started a penal investigation.Official action taken - other official action: A special committee (Committee Oosting) has been installed to investigate the disaster. The committee presented its report on February 28, 2001.Assisted by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports (VWS) a Centre for Information and Advice (Informatie- en Adviescentrum) was set up shortly after the disaster, and measures have been taken concerning medical and psycho-social after-care. The Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment (VROM) was involved in soil decontamination, demolition of buildings and removal of asbestosThe Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (SZW) was involved in three financial emergency arrangements in the week after the disaster for occupants involved.The government gave an advance to the city Enschede to cover additional expenses. Also, funds have been added to the budgets of several departments (total amount DFL 92,1 million).Eight state inspections have conducted an investigation, final reports were presented on January 15, 2001.Four state inspections have conducted an investigation into the follow-up of the fireworks explosion in Culemborg in 1991. These reports were presented on February 19, 2001.In the third week of June, all mayors involved were informed of locations of munitions depots by the Ministry of Defence in consultation with VROM.On June 26, 2000, the Court of Mayor and Aldermen of Enschede have installed the Committee Financial Settlements (Commissie Financi\u00eble Afwikkeling). Arrangements for private persons and companies were presented in September and November 2000. VROM took the initiative to construct a directive on fireworks. The concept directive was published on February 26, 2001.On July 27, 2000 VROM presented an inventory of fireworks companies in The Netherlands Between July and October 2000, the external safety of munitions depots was inventoried by the Environmental Hygiene Inspection ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Next to the shortcomings of the company itself, the Committee Oosting reported a series of shortcomings in the government. These include not giving appropriate attention to the matter of external safety (at least where professional fireworks are concerned), not following up on lessons learned from an earlier fireworks explosion (Culemborg, 1991), inaccessibility of regulations and information on the subject, lack of communication between the official organisation and the politically responsible administrators and lack of supervision and enforcement. These issues have received a lot of political attention. Measures are planned concerning:-investigation into the disaster-state actions after the disaster-regulations on fireworks (both existing regulations and a new directive)-the permit policy -the external safety policyMeasures to mitigate consequences: Measures concerning (for details see references): -incorporating experiences in relevant documents (e.g. the National Handbook Crisis Decision Making (nationaal handboek crisisbesluitvorming))-the quality and supervision of preparing for disasters-intensifying the multi-disciplinary approach in disaster preparation-the co-ordination of combatting disasters and the National Support Facility Disaster Combatment (Landelijke Ondersteuningsfaciliteit Rampenbestrijding)-emergency rooms, communication and information provision-protection of environment and health|\u00b7 information and advice centre (Informatie- en Adviescentrum)-psycho-social and medical after-care -financial arrangements-municipality disaster combat plans-co-ordination of investigations into disaster combatUseful References: Report of the Committee Investigation Fireworks Disaster ('Committee Oosting'), February 28, 2001; MAHB, Workshop on Pyrotechnic and Explosive Substances, March 28-29; Cabinet Standpoint Fireworks Disaster, March 23, 2001"

        "Accident Description": "At 06:37 on 16 November 2006 the plant experienced a drop in its power supply, i.e. a reduction in voltage on lines 277 and 278, which supply the plant with electricity from the nearby substation. This brief drop in voltage triggered the closure of the BFG supply pipes, resulting in the shut-down of the main BFG draw-off points (heating-plant boilers Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6, and the combustion boilers of push furnaces 1 and 4) and other, smaller BFG draw-off points at the plant. This caused a substantial increase in pressure in the main BFG distributor (about 16 kPa), followed by the extinction of the burners on BFG stacks 2 and 3 (increase in BFG flow to maximum) and the bursting open of pressure traps on the main BFG distributor (26 traps). This resulted in a release of BFG, which was signalled by the CO monitoring system (external and internal CO monitoring at the plant). The CO release was reported at 06:45 and emergency control arrangements were put in place; the Energy Division\u2019s control centre requested a reduction in the supply of BFG by 200 000 Nm3/hour, by reducing blasting. At the same time, action was taken by the company\u2019s own fire brigade (air quality monitoring, adding and closing of pressure traps, evacuation of employees), and by the company\u2019s private security service (closure of roads). After the necessary technical measures had been performed on the installations (gradual ignition of the burners of the heating plant boilers and of the combustion boilers of the push furnaces, shut-down of blast furnace No 2 \u2013 interruption of the blasting of hot air, resulting in a reduction in the production of iron and of BFG), pressure in the main BFG distributor gradually fell until a stable value of 2-6 kPa was reached. At 08:00, the levels of released CO in the air were falling, as most of the pressure traps had already been closed. At 09:05, the company's fire brigade stopped monitoring CO levels at the plant and in its immediate vicinity; the CO values were within the legal limits. The evacuation was completed; production continued unchanged after the MIA had been dealt with. Seven vehicles equipped with measuring devices for monitoring CO releases to air were deployed.The evacuation of the plant\u2019s employees and employees of external firms was organised and directed by controllers from the Coking Plant, Hot-Rolling, Cold-Rolling, Transport, Service and Energy Divisions, and implemented by the company\u2019s fire brigade, company's fire brigade, and its private security service. A total of 359 people were evacuated. The evacuation point was determined in accordance with the divisional emergency plans and in line with measurements taken using personal analysers; nobody was injured during the evacuation.No injuries were sustained by employees and no damage was done to technical installations during the MIA, the major occurrence of which took place between 06:37 and 08:45.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The initial cause of the emergency was the failure of the electricity supply from the supplier (omissis substation), a drop in voltage on power lines 277 and 278 to 0.3 Un for a period of 0.75 s (a drop in the phase voltage to 6 kV, and to less than 2 kV in some cases, in the company's power cables).The second cause was that safeguard installations (back-up sources) were non-existent or inadequate, as were the measures to address such an emergency, as a result of which some of the key appliances using the BFG (heating plant boilers K1, K3, K55 and K6 and push furnace combustion boilers (SKNP) Nos 1 and 4) at the company's plant failed.",
        "Consequences": "Impact on human life: none.Impact on human health: none.Environmental damage: none. The environs of the plant were neither affected nor at risk.Damage to property: none; blast furnace No 2 was shut down in order to deal with the MIA: blasting of hot air into the blast furnace stopped; production resumed at the blast furnace after the MIA had been dealt with.",
        "Emergency response": "- called extraordinary emergency dispatching- reduction of blast furnace gas supply- refilling and closing of water seals- evacuation of 311 persons- closing of communications",
        "Lesson Learned": "INSPECTION AND ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONThe omissis Inspectorate and omissis Environment Office took part in the inspection at the site of the accident.The accident investigation was carried out in accordance with the legislation in force by the omissis Inspectorate on 23 November and 1 December 2006 and on 10 and 12 January 2007. The investigation formed the basis for a report which was forwarded to the omissis Environment Office in accordance with Act No 261/2002 on the prevention of major industrial accidents.MEASURES PROPOSED AND ADOPTEDFollowing the MIA, the plant operator took the following measures, setting deadlines for their implementation:\u2022 Temporary procedure for operation at up to 120 000 m3 until start-up of BFG storage tank (deadline: 16 November 2006);\u2022 Start-up of heating plant boiler No 2 to increase BFG draw-off \u2013 total of six boilers (deadline: 16 November 2006);\u2022 Further investigation of an event two weeks previously \u2013 combustion stack outage (deadline: 24 November 2006);\u2022 Verification of functioning of stacks, their supply and control from the control room in the event of undervoltage \u2013 simulated undervoltage (deadline: 4 December 2006);\u2022 Establishment of three crews to work in emergencies using protective insulating devices (deadline: 24 November 2006);\u2022 Allocation to the anti-gas protection post of one-hour protective insulation devices \u2013 at least 30% of devices (deadline: 24 November 2006);\u2022 Training for every shift maintenance team on priority treatment of stack control and the site of potential failures (deadline: 24 November 2006);\u2022 Installation of a back-up source for heating-plant boiler No 1 and a stack management system in the CO monitoring control room (deadline: 31 December 2006);The plant operator has adopted the following official measures to prevent the recurrence of a major industrial accident of this or a similar type.\u2022 Continuous operational control of the volume of BFG burnt in combustion stacks 2 and 3 in order to cope with the failure of a major draw-off appliance and to monitor the stacks in accordance with the occupational safety procedure (deadline: 18 November 2006);\u2022 Increase in the stability of supply to the burners of heating-plant boiler No 1 in the event of undervoltage (back-up source) (deadline: end 2006);\u2022 Identification of critical equipment in the light of the installation of back-up sources, and preventive maintenance for back-up sources (deadline: Q1 2007);\u2022 Archiving of data (detailed records) from the omissis system for one week (deadline: 30 November 2006);\u2022 Proposal for a system for monitoring power supply and losses in the case of high-voltage substations and establishment of harmonised system time for operational computers (deadline: Q1 2007);\u2022 Proposal for on-off arrangement for combustion stacks at approximately 100 000 m3 (deadline: technical development panel \u2013 December 2006);\u2022 Proposal for self-regenerating pressure traps for gas (deadline: end 2006).The omissis Inspectorate, in accordance with Section 13(3)(b) of Act No 95/2000 on labour inspection and amending certain acts, as amended, has ordered the Company to:\u2022 Ensure adequate risk assessment and adopt safety measures to ensure safety and health at work so that a power cut or drop in the electricity supply does not result in an uncontrolled release of BFG to the air and put at risk the safety and health of employees and other persons present on the employer\u2019s premises (deadline: immediate and continuous);\u2022 Ensure removal of BFG from pressure traps so that they are not located in the breathing zone, in accordance with Section 6(1)(d) of Act No 124/2006 on safety and health at work;- Deadline: within 30 days from receipt of the report.The omissis Environment Office has proposed the following measures:\u2022 Drafting of an emergency scenario for this type of BFG release from BFG distributor pipes;\u2022 Incorporation of this scenario in the plant\u2019s emergency plan;\u2022 Adaptation of the risk assessment with regard to the main BFG distributor to take suitable account of similar situations;The deadline for the measures proposed by the omissis Office is the date of the next updating of the Company plant\u2019s safety report.CONCLUSION AND EVALUATIONOn the basis of the information received from the omissis Inspectorate, which investigated the MIA at the Company plant, and of knowledge gained from the omissis Environment Office\u2019s own activities, it may be concluded that the MIA was not caused by negligence on the part of the plant\u2019s employees or operator, or by other organisations or persons present at the plant. The omissis Inspectorate has detected an infringement of the law, notably Section 6(1)(c), (d) and (f) of Act No 124/2006 on safety and health at work and amending certain acts and provisions, in that the organisation did not adequately assess the risk and also did not take safety measures to ensure safety and health at work so that a power cut or drop in the electricity supply does not result in an uncontrolled release of BFG to the air and put at risk the health and safety of employees and other persons present on the employer\u2019s premises. The omissis Inspectorate has not imposed any penalties or issued a prohibition on the operation of the installation.The omissis Environment Office has proposed measures to prevent major industrial accidents at the Company which it will apply rigorously to the operator in the imminent updating of the plant\u2019s safety report provided for in Section 9 of Act No 261/2002 on the prevention of major industrial accidents and amending certain acts, as amended.The major industrial accident at the Company occurred \u2013 and was caused \u2013 as result of a power supply failure and the subsequent failure of the plant\u2019s technical and safety installations."

The most likely cause of the explosion was the ignition of phthalic anhydride dust by a static discharge from the unbonded chute. The bursting disc in the kettle pressure relief line did not ruptured. The underlying causes were a lack of safety culture together with a design plant inadequate.\n",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:1 person was injured by the explosion (he was blown back by the overpressure and broke his arm as he fell to the ground). Two other operators standing nearby were not injured.MATERIAL LOSS:The charging chute was propelled upwards by the explosion and damaged the kettle's agitator motor. The cost of the damaged motor has been evaluated in about 0.0013 M Euros.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "No emergency measures were necessary, neither on-site nor off-site.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the company was required to check that all the equipment used to transfer phthalic anhydride powder was bonded to earth and to amend the operating procedures to ensure that the risks associated with phtalic anhydride were highlighted."

At 9.35 a.m., he rammed his light commercial vehicle into a covered warehouse used for filling pressure cylinders. The warehouse was storing 238 cylinders of acetone, butane and propane (flammable gases) each containing between 1 and 3&nbsp;m\u00b3 of gas. Several cylinders exploded within a minute of the crash. Pieces of the front of the warehouse fell to the ground as the vehicle and several cylinders began to catch fire.&nbsp;\nThe site\u2019s security alerted the firemen on duty at the nearby station, who arrived on site in less than 15 minutes. When searching the scene of the explosions, they found the delivery man opening by hand the valves of acetone cylinders stored in an open warehouse next door. The man would set fire to a cylinder and move on to the next one. One of the firemen rushed towards the man and managed to restrain him.&nbsp; His arm was slightly injured in the process. The firemen extinguished the burning cylinders and then stopped the leaks while the police secured the industrial area. The employees were evacuated, 6 complaining of headaches and slight hearing loss. The employees of nearby companies were told to stay indoors. A body without a head was found inside the damaged commercial vehicle. The decapitated head of a man was found when the gendarmes searched the site. He had been beheaded by the attacker just before the vehicle entered the site. The investigation was assigned to the anti-terrorism section of the prosecutor\u2019s office. The Vigipirate national security alert system was raised to \u2018attack alert\u2019 level in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region for 3 days.

        "Accident Description": "At around 15:00 on 29 December 2020, a fire broke out in one of the company's production buildings (PB).\nAt around 06:00, workers on the early shift established that the intake side of the extraction system had been damaged. A sizeable hole was found in the cable, the repair of which would be a major undertaking.&nbsp;\nThe extraction system is needed for the exhaust gases of the vacuum system and local exhaust ventilation, but is not directly technologically linked to each subsystem. It was decided to run the production line empty and turn off the system components as required (partial shutdown).&nbsp;\nThe last components in this technological circuitry of the multi-purpose facility are the belt filter and the screw conveyor, with a downstream dryer.The product is washed and drained (pre-dried) on the belt filter.At the end of this stage of the process, when it works as intended, the product still has a residual moisture content of approximately 25 to 30% of mass, at which level ignition is not to be expected.\nThe partial shutdown did not include the shutdown of the belt filter and the screw conveyor. The belt filter works with warm air. In the screw conveyor, friction in the bearings can generate hot spots.\nAround 15:09, a muffled bang alerted facility staff to a malfunction in the facility. At 15:16 the control centre received an emergency callout for the factory fire brigade.The fire involved approximately 100 kg of dibutyltin oxide and 100 kg of dioctyltin oxide.A firefighter was injured in the course of the firefighting efforts (fracture of a middle finger).\nSafety measures:The shift leader was informed and the factory fire brigade were alerted in accordance with the hazard prevention plan.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The expert is assuming that the dibutyltin oxide (DBTO) self-ignited in a funnel/feeding hopper or in the screw conveyor downstream.As a result of the frame construction with open floor grilles, the fire spread as far as the third floor. The ground floor fittings were damaged by the fire-fighting water.Self-ignition of the normally moist product, in the partially shutdown plant.",

        "Finish Date": "2021-08-08 05:45:00",
        "Accident Description": "At 23:32&nbsp;hrs on 7&nbsp;August 2021, a fire broke out in an alcoholates factory\u2019s extraction system.A defective overflow sensor caused the supply of salt water to sodium (Na) electrolysis cells to be suspended and the cells were shut down.The hydrogen/chlorine mixture resulting from the process was sucked into the waste gas system.The rapid shutdown of a large number of Na cells caused significant flow variations. This led to a short circuit in a potassium electrolysis cell in production at that time.The hydrogen/chlorine mixture produced during the short circuit was ignited.\nAfter the plant\u2019s emergency shutdown, this cell was also switched to the common waste gas system, causing the flammable hydrogen/chloro mixture already present in the waste gas system to re-ignite.\nSafety functions:A faulty reading from an overflow safety device suspended the supply of salt water to the cells. If the supply of salt water is suspended, the cells must be shut down. In the process, the valve to the waste gas flow path is opened. This also worked.\nIn the event of a short circuit, a cell is shut down and the valve to the waste gas flow path is likewise opened. This also proceeded as planned.\nA short circuit in a cell is a pre-designed scenario that is controlled by safety-oriented measures and one that has already occurred in rare cases. The overflow safety device is operationally tested and previous cases have been reported of process control faults in the overflow safety device. A simultaneous short circuit and process control failure in an overflow safety device with the ensuing sequence of events described above was hitherto unknown.\nThe pressure drop in the common waste gas system ensured that damage to the waste gas pipes did not lead to the release of other substances contained in the waste gas, but to ambient air being sucked into the waste gas system instead. This explains the low levels of substances released.\nThe mitigation and security actions taken immediately after the incident occurred ran as expected:Plant fire service alerted and briefed on arrival, fire extinguished with quenching water, quenching water retained, fire watch after fire had been extinguished.\nNo further actions, such as rescue efforts, paramedical intervention, warnings in surrounding areas, evacuation, etc., were necessary.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Damage to the rubber coating on the overflow sensor\u2019s detector caused the detector to corrode and emit faulty readings.The failure of multiple electrolysis cells caused variations in pressure.This caused denting in a cellular sheet, agitating the surface of the liquid in the working cell. The liquid\u2019s subsequent wave motion led to a short circuit in that cell.",
        "Consequences": "Damage to equipment, pipes, parts of the building. Costs: EUR&nbsp;19,600,000",
        "Emergency response": "Inside the operating area: plant fire service called out, quenching water used in order to fight the fire.No actions required outside the operating area.\nRepairs to equipment and parts of the building damaged by the fire.&nbsp;\nQuenching water (contaminated with mercury) was retained and fed into an enabled storage basin in the waste water treatment plant.Waste water in the basement was pumped into containers and tank wagons, and brought to the company\u2019s waste water treatment plant.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nRedesign the waste gas system in flue ducts with more than 4 cells, upgrading it in size to provide significantly greater reserve capacity.\nFit smaller openings to the flush nozzles of the flue duct on the individual cells and factor these into the flue system\u2019s redesign.\nIn the event of multiple cell failures within a short time (a few minutes), disable the power supply to all cells automatically.\nFlue ducts to be made of conductive glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP). No polyethylene (PE) inliner is needed.\nBy diverting the mercury flow, hydrogen only develops in the cell for a very short period when it is shut down. Reduce the total volume of hydrogen produced when the cell is shut down by limiting the concentration of sodium or potassium in the respective cell intake. These measures dramatically reduce the overall amount of hydrogen which develops.\nAn alarm will replace the stand-by system implemented for quality reasons on the salt water intake to the cells.\nA status circuit which shuts down the plant will be fitted to the pure salt water container.\n\n&nbsp;No serious danger outside the operating area; no further measures to limit the impact outside the operating area."

The pipeline concerned was leaking blast furnace gas although the gate valve was shut. The working permit foresaw the use of self respirators as protective equipment. During the shut-off plate installation the team foreman from a contracting company lost consciousness and fell on the ground. Two more workers were affected taking off their self respirator masks during the intent to help the foremen. A fourth worker employed by ILVA was affected when he rushed from the ground floor to give assistance. The team foremen died during the transport to the hospital, while the two other workers and the employee of ILVA were hospitalised and dismissed after a few days following treatment in a hyperbaric chamber.The accident is notified to the European Commission, due to the one fatality occurred, applying annex VI point 2 of the Seveso II Directive.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The analysis of the official expert report has shown that the decease occurred due to CO intoxication, the CO was contained in the blast furnace gas. According to the technical expert report, the cause of the decease is attributed to an improper use of the self respirator mask. Further there deficiencies in the training programs for the personnel have been identified.The analysis of the accident causes as described above was deduced from the documentation provided by ILVA and from the technical consultancy report requested by the Attorney-General's Office during the legal proceedings in course in date 14/3/2007.In particular the conclusions of the technical consultancy report state that the fatal accident occurred because the victim had not been involved in an effective training and information process -on the presence of CO in the working area, -on the noxious effects of such gas if inhaled even for a very short period of time, and - on the crucial requirement to wear permanently personal protective equipment. This crucial requirement has not been respected by the worker during the operation, who several times removed his respirator mask to communicate over the phone. The behaviour of the worker is an infringement of the existing national norms D.LGs 629/94 and successive amendments and integrations, concerning art. 4,21 and 22.",

Although emergency response measures were taken immediately, the emergency response operation encountered difficulties in reaching the accident point located in a gallery some 15 m from the ground, due to the presence of equipment and provisory structures.Emergency measures - Remarks: The onsite sanitary relief service and the onsite fire brigade intervened, providing first aid assistance to the persons involved in the accident and transported them from the accident point to the emergency response vehicles for the transport to hospital.\nMeasures have been taken to gather basic information for the accident analysis.\nOfficial action taken - legal action: The Attorney General's office is investigating the causes of the fatal accident occurred to the worker. During this procedure an official technical consultancy report has been deposited, the report has been used to prepare the present report.Responce - Discussion about responce: Following measures have been adopted by the company:Relation with external contractors:-The company plans to modify the safety management system by increasing the frequency and type of preventive controls on the activities performed by the external contractors. - Further the company plans the integration and improvement of the content of the training courses for the external contracting companies and the onsite personnel.Revision of working permit delivery procedure: - Clearer definition of the responsibilities of the onsite personnel;- Modification of the forms with the objective to indicate clearer the hazard sources present in the work area;- Definition of standards concerning the information content of the safety reports to be presented by external contractors;- Definition of the authorisation delivery process to access the equipment and eventually use open flames.Mitigation measures:- The company has reinforced and optimized the sanitary service concerning the training of the doctors, nurses, drivers, security personnel and plant personnel, and&nbsp; foreseeing first aid measures provided by a series of vehicles with first aid equipment, dislocated onsite such to reach any accident point much faster than the onsite ambulance. - The onsite fire brigade has been reinforced from 4 members per shift to 6 memebrs. All members of the onsite fire brigade have received an integrative training of 120 hrs by the provincial fire department.The accident analysis has pointed out the difficulties encountered in reaching the working area in which the accident occurred, due to the presence of permanent equipment structures and provisory structures. For this reason the company has adopted measures to facilitate the access to the working areas (e.g. mobile platforms) and in this way facilitate the evacuation of the personnel in case of an emergency.The decision to equip the personnel with additional pressure air cylinders has the objective to facilitate the evacuation in safe condition in case of emergency, allowing to shut down the central air circulation system and automatically switch to the reserve air cylinders.Seveso II duties  - remarks: The safety report dated 2000 has\nbeen evaluated with a negative result because the documentation\nprovided has been considered as insufficient. Presently the safety\nreport dated 2006 is under evaluation.\nThe accident scenarios considered in safety report did not take into\naccount the accident dynamics of this accident because it can not be\nclassified as accidental release. The accident was manged according to\nthe emergency response plan as generic emergency and as such was\ncompetence of the onsite fire brigade and the onsite sanitary service.\nThe conclusion concerning inadequate training and information level\nhave been taken from the official technical consultancy report given in\ncharge by the Attorney General's Office and refers specifically to the\npersonnel of external contractors and subcontractors. The report does\nnot make any reference concerning the behaviour of the ILVA worker, who\nrushed to the accident place without protective equipment.\n",

        "Accident Description": "The accident involved the synthesis department \"RS2\" in which \"Ambimmina\" (commercial name) is produced, starting from raw materials in a toluene solution. The unit in the department involved essentially consists of a reactor in which the synthesis process was performed and a hydro-extractor&nbsp; centrifuge&nbsp; separating the product coming from the reactor into the commercial product and mother liquor. The product is loaded into the centrifuge by connecting the reactor to the centrifuge with a approx. 2 m long collecting pipe intercepted by 2 manually operated valves. The reactor has a capacity of 3000 litres whereas the centrifuge has a diameter of 1250 mm and a maximum capacity of 300 KG.Concerning the accident, according to the information given by the company, a fire occurred involving all the toluene (2000 litres) present in the reactor and in the centrifuge. The fire, according to the signs left on the department structures, affected the department ground-floor within a radius of 10 metres of the centrifuge, and the two upper floors damaging the above mentioned reactor and other equipment present. The hydro-extractor shows evidence of a deformation in the lid along an axial line and some sealing hinges of the lid came unwelded.",
        "Causes of the accident": "It is not possible for the time being to give any indication as to the causes of the accident because both the state attorneys office of Como and the Company itself are carrying out investigations into the matter.",
        "Consequences": "The plant operator was involved in the accident and, according to the legal medical report, died on the spot due to thermal shock 5 or 6 metres from the centrifuge.\nConcerning the material loss, evidence of damage can be found on the reactor, on the service equipment and on the structural elements of the whole synthesis department building.\nWhen the inspection was performed, only a part of the building was accessible because the area surrounding the reactor and the hydro-extractor had been put under judicial seizure by the judicial authority.\n&nbsp;Area concerned - Remarks:&nbsp; The accident affected the whole synthesis department \"RS2\" and the adjoining area within a radius of approximately 10 m.People - remarks:When the accident occurred only the operator who subsequently died was present.Material Loss:At the present time the company is not able to quantify material damage suffered and in particular that linked with loss of production (the most relevant) due to the fact that the plant is still under judicial seizure.",
        "Emergency response": "The company requested immediately after the event the intervention of the Como fire brigade and started the fire extinguishing procedures with the on-site fire fighting equipment. The Como fire brigade arrived 5 minutes after the alert and took over command of operations continuing the extinguishing operations and the successive securing operations&nbsp; of the plant.Official action taken - legal action: Investigation of the Como state attorneys office.Seveso II duties  - remarks: The company is subject to\ndeclaration according to DPR 175/88 concerning inventories below the\nthreshold limit. For this purpose the company presented the declaration\nforeseen in 1990 and a safety report in 1993, which was completed on\n22.10.1999 as requested by the Regione Lombardia following the request\nof SPRI (regional communication).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: At present the company has not taken any further prevention or mitigation measures due to the fact that it is expecting the results from the accident investigation."

        "Accident Description": "The natural circulation between the sump of a column and an evaporator failed, it was detected because the evaporator stopped absorbing the heating medium (8 bar steam).It is assumed that during the trial run of the new column system water accumulated on the product side of the evaporator. Due to this reason a DN25-pipeline was switched from the manual draining valve 1 to the manual draining valve 2 of the column sump discharge pipeline, with the objective to drain the water from the evaporator in direction of the column located downstream to the evaporator.Due to the fact that there was no circulation (the pipeline kept cold), a blind cover was opened, to allow water drainage in the open (catch cup). The operation was performed during the afternoon and the evening respectively by two operators, one of which would open the blind cover, observe the water flow released and then close the blind cover again, while the other operator would open the manual valve and close it again as soon the released water flow would stop.The event occurred during the water drainage procedure at 23:30 (the onsite fire brigade was alerted at 23:36), when the manual valve could not be closed again completely.Following to that propylene gas was released through the discharge nozzle. The blind cover could not be closed again due to the high pressure in the column and resulted in a large quantity of propylene gas released.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A trial run was performed on a new column with evaporator etc. (before starting service).Propylene pressure was of approx.&nbsp; 22 Bar, sump temperature of approx. 60 \u00b0C. The product flow rate approx. 40% of the service flow.The event was caused by a defective manual valve, mounted on the water drainage pipeline of the newly built gas purification column in the isopropyl alcohol plant (IPA-synthesis). The manual valve was opened during trial operation of the plant. After several actuations, welding particles were flushed out from the system and deposited on the valve seat. A tight closure of the valve was not any more possible and propylene was released after the water. Despite the immediate shut-down of the plant pressure equalisation took a relatively long time.",
        "Consequences": "Loss of propylene, extinguishing water",
        "Emergency response": "Emergency response measures by the plant staff and the on-site fire brigade.Within the first hour the on-site emergency response service established contact with the fire department (a part from the phone calls a notification was sent by fax), and with the emergency service of the competent environmental agency (by telephone).Due to the fact that the gas-cloud was limited to a radius of 50m around the column by means of water curtains, and that outside of the water curtains there was no gas detectable, there was no need of intervention of external emergency response services. Due to the very local characteristic of the event and to the fact that there had been no need of intervention of external emergency response services, the competent emergency information and assistance office was not notified.",
        "Lesson Learned": "It is mandatory to mount shut-off valves upstream from blind coversSafety relevant shut-off valves have to be exclusively redundantAll staff has to be regularly schooled concerning specific hazards and risks deriving from plant equipmentSafety relevant decisions have to taken only by several persons together (four eyes principle)The process of assessing risks and the definition of measures has to be documentedThe effectiveness of measures has to be monitored and documented "

        "Accident Description": "The accident happened in a recycling plant for aluminium. At the end of the night-shift one of the main furnaces at the plant exploded - killing two operators and causing a total damage of the production plant. Another operator was seriously injured and&nbsp;two other operators had minor physical injuries. The plants office building was destroyed by a fire following the explosion.&nbsp;\nThe explosion occurred during re-melting of aluminum scrap. This is a 17 - hour batch operation, and is considered as a normal melting oven operation.&nbsp;The operators worked in the production hall and had finalized the charging of the oven just a few minutes before the explosion. Everything seemed to be normal. The operators had noticed minor disturbances in the oven (two times a bang) prior to the explosion, but this&nbsp;was not unusual and no interventions were made.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nA violent explosion occurred, and the melting oven was completely destroyed and melted metal, half-melted metal, warm bricks, concrete, steel and other construction materials were thrown in all directions. The entire production facility collapsed.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The health and safety authorities performed an inspection of the enterprise in order to clarify the course of events and the causes. The inspection report point out&nbsp; deviations from the regulations related to insufficient plant risk assessment and scrap receiving procedures.\nIt has not been possible to reconstruct the course of events in detail, because the process log was lost in the fire. The inquiry concluded that the explosion most probably was caused by entrapped water in the scrap feed into the furnace containing melted aluminum. The conclusion is well supported by observations and assessments, but not evident. As a part of the technical-operational inquiry, Gexcon has performed a report outlining the possible courses of events. Incidentally, the conclusion correspond with the fact that most aluminum casthouse explosions with severe consequences are caused by water vapor explosions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "2&nbsp;operators were killed and&nbsp;three injured. The plant was totally damaged. No injuries or damage outside the plant.",
        "Emergency response": "The police, local firebrigade, ambulance service, Civil defense and Rescue helicopter were part of the emergency response. The firebrigade extinguished the fires and used smoke-divers in the search&nbsp;for people.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The risk of explosions when you have&nbsp;entrapped water in the scrap is well known from literature and experiences from accidents. This top event is not sufficiently dealt with in the companies risk assessment, and therefore not reflected in their internal procedures or focused&nbsp;in the daily operation of the plant. Since it was regarded as normal to have minur disturbances when charging, it seems that there was an acceptance to feed&nbsp;moist scrap metal to the furnace.&nbsp;"

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A reaction (which used Raney Nickel as a catalyst) was carried out in a 4,000 litres reactor. After the reaction had been completed, the vessel (which was located on a lower floor) was to be flushed out using ethanol decanted from a 8,000 litres reactor. The control room operator, aware that the contents of the larger vessel would not fit into the 4,000 litres vessel, instructed the local operator to check the decanting operation into the lower vessel. The operator manually checked the level in the 4,000 litres reactor a number of times. During the last inspection, he observed that the smaller reactor was full. He closed the man-hole and the heating started. After a certain period of time, the control room operator discovered that the temperature of the reactor's contents was 87\u00b0C, well above the pre-set level of 70\u00b0C. He shut off the reactor's jacket steam but shortly afterwards the fire alarm in the area and the sprinkler system was activated. An investigation of the scene showed that the sprinkler system was activated and an area around the reactor's man-hole was blackened as a result of a flash fire. The flash fire was extinguished by the sprinkler system. As no one was in the area when the accident occurred, no one was injured.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:Post-accident investigations carried out by the company showed that the temperature control loop failed allowing the temperature rise to 87\u00b0C instead of 70\u00b0C required (the output of the automatic control failed to update the control valve position even though it was correctly set). The reactor's man-hole clamps were not fully tightened and ethanol vapours must have been emitted from an overfull reactor. An examination of the contents of the 8,000 litres reactor after the accident showed that the smaller reactor was slightly overfilled. The most probable source of ignition was the pyrophoric Nickel material forced out of the reactor by the boiling ethanol through the partially closed man-hole. The investigation revealed that all electrical equipments in the area were correctly functioning.",
        "Consequences": "MATERIAL LOSS:The cost of the damage caused by the flash fire to the electrical cables around the reactor has been evaluated in about 0.0013 M Euros.People - Remarks: When the accident occurred no one was in the area and so no one was injured by the flash fire.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire at the reactor man-hole activated a sprinkler head located above the vessel. It resulted in the fire alarm and the activation of the sprinkler system. By the time the supervisor arrived on the scene (2 minutes later) the fire was extinguished by the sprinkler system. The company fire crew was activated but its intervention was not necessary.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:No off-site emergency measures were necessary.No emergency measures are still required, niether  on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the Industrial Inspectorate required the company to:\n1- repair the faulty temperature control loop;\n2- provide for the post-campaign flush-out batch sheet to give a warning of potential overfilling of the reactor;\n3- introduce proper man-hole cover bolting practices;\n4- ensure that control room attendants carefully review all non-standard operations with local operators;\n5- update preventive maintenance plans to ensure that steam control valves and associated control loops are regularly checked."

The charging operator had just started operating the control valve on the acetone addition line (3 metres away) when the explosion occurred.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nInvestigations showed that the procedure was not a normal one because dry powder was added to the flammable solvent instead of the usual wet cake. The powder was a finished product that did not passed quality control purity test and had to be recrystallized. No nitrogen inerting was used and, as some acetone vapours would have been emitted from the charging chute, the combustion was made possible. The insufficient operational procedures for this situation allowed to carry out it without considering the risk of a dust explosion.

        "Accident Description": "On 8&nbsp;July 2021, between 20:22 and 20:35, a blow-through (the abrupt collapse of the ore and coke layers, resulting in gas flowing suddenly through the furnace atmosphere, increasing its pressure, towards the furnace head) occurred at blast furnace 2 (HO2).\nAs a result, the dip tube in the cyclone was damaged and deformed so badly that it prevented gas from passing from the cyclone to the scrubber.Consequently, there was a rise in pressure on the section between the furnace head and the inlet of the cyclone. At 20:32, as a result of the rise in pressure the HO2 safety valves (\u2018bleeders\u2019) were opened hydraulically for 6 minutes. The incident ended with the initiation of an emergency stop of HO2.\nThe bleeders are located on a 86 m platform and are, according to the description in the blast furnace partial safety report, the safety devices provided which prevent and safely release an unacceptable overpressure in the blast furnace.\nThis measure resulted in an emission perceptible from outside the factory (discharge of dusty blast furnace gas with audible flow noise).\nSafety functions:The scheduled safety functions were triggered correctly and caused pressure to be relieved by opening the pressure-relief valves (bleeders).",
        "Causes of the accident": "In order to determine the cause of the severe flow problems and the ensuing \u2018blow-through\u2019, all available data were evaluated:Several causes, which together resulted in the blow-through, had to be considered. The likely causes were an accumulation of minor furnace-cycle faults (e.g. accretions*) and changes to the charged feedstocks, which have a major impact on gas-flow behaviour in the blast furnace. These then led to the blow-through, which was remedied by means of the familiar method of compression.\nThe bleeders were opened because the damaged dip tube was blocking the outlet of the cyclone.The dip tube in the cyclone is likely to have been damaged by thermal overload and was so badly deformed that it prevented gas from passing from the cyclone to the scrubber. As a result, there was a rise in pressure on the section between the furnace head and the outlet of the cyclone.At 20:32, as a result of the rise in pressure, the blast furnace\u2019s safety valves (\u2018bleeders\u2019) were opened hydraulically for 6 minutes.The incident ended with the initiation of an emergency stop of the blast furnace owing to the sharp decrease in wind volume flow and the accompanying drop in counter-pressure.\nThe manufacturer of the cyclone was also asked to check, in particular, whether such incidents had already come to light.The manufacturer replied that this was not the case, with no previous reports of such disturbances.\n*Burden materials which settle on the blast furnace\u2019s wall (shaft, coal sack and bosh) from the effects of heat.",
        "Consequences": "Assorted structural steel works on the cyclone after a technical inspection.\nAs a result of the rapid shutdown of blast furnace 2, the emergency stop resulted in the following unavoidable damage:All 42 tuy&egrave;res had to be opened as these were clogged with clinker. The 42 manifolds of blast furnace 2 had to be changed because they were similarly clogged. Of the 42 blast connections, 29 had to be opened and 9 of them changed.Damage to property: EUR&nbsp;500,000\nFlow noise audible for approximately 6&nbsp;min.\nSoiling of motor vehicles, cleaning costs.Damage to property: EUR&nbsp;500",
        "Emergency response": "The on-site fire service and relevant on-call teams were informed.A D2 alert was issued by the plant\u2019s fire service and withdrawn at 21:10.Measurement of CO pollution at the factory by the works fire service and, in adjacent districts, by the Duisburg regular fire service. In each case, no concentrations of CO were detected.A press release was prepared.The competent district administration was immediately alerted by telephone, point of contact via the operator\u2019s stand-by service.\nSubsequent reports of soiling from falling dust were dealt with.No claims for damages to date.\nCO measurements by the regular fire service in neighbouring districts (no findings).",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nDuring forthcoming outages (longer than 72&nbsp;h), additional cyclone inspections will be scheduled. It will also be examined whether this inspection can be carried out using drones in order to minimise the time-consuming preparations, e.g. degassing and ventilation, scaffolding.\nUsing the existing \u2018cyclone gas inlet\u2019 temperature measurement as an indicator of possible impending damage to the cyclone (and therefore also to the dip tube), and including it to monitor furnace operations, is still under examination.\n"

        "Accident Description": "A dedicated CS2 road tanker arrived at the specially designed off-loading bay at 00:28 on September 26, 1987. The shift operator arrived at the bay at 00:45 and, with the help of the tanker driver, started to make the necessary routine off-loading hose and nitrogen pressurizing connections. After applying nitrogen pressure to all four tank compartments, the operator noticed that compartment No 2 was air-locked and bubbles were visible in the flow sight glass. He left the control bay and attempted to clear the air lock by opening and closing the discharge valve. As he was returning to the bay to check again the sight glass, he saw flames creeping up the near side of the tanker. Immediately he operated the alarm switch located in the bay which simultaneously started the deluge system and initiated the on-site emergency routine. The tanker driver has incorrectly returned to his cab and had to jump clear as the flames engulfed the vehicle. The works fire team used hand-held AFFF extinguishers and the fire was controlled before of the local brigade arrival on-site. The driver suffered only minor injuries but the shift operator was detained in hospital for one day as he was suffering from severe shock and received minor bruisings and abrasions in his haste to descend the loading bay access stairway.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nThe initial cause of the carbon disulphide spillage was the failure of an EMCO-Wheaton quick release hose connection. The female half has two diametrically-opposed lever operated locking cams: due to incorrect engagement or accidental displacement of these levers, the coupling fell apart during carbon disulphide discharge under nitrogen blanket pressure. Subsequent examination of the mating parts revealed a degree of wear but when properly engaged the coupling was considered serviceable",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 1 people (of the 2 exposed) was injured by fire. The driver suffered only minor injuries but the shift operator was detained in hospital for one day as he was suffering from severe shock and received minor bruising and abrasions in his haste to descend the loading bay access stairway.MATERIAL LOSSFire damaged the off-loading bay and road tanker's tyres and breaking system.

The works fire team attend the scene.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The works incident controller alerted the external emergency services. The local fire brigade attended but the accident was under control before their arrival on-site.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still measures, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1. provision and use of modified type of hose connection which incorporates a security ring designed to engage over the levers of the locking cams;\n2. a more rigorous routine examination of the hose coupling involving the use of standard test male and to check the degree of wear in the locking cams and the amount of compression of the annular rubber seal;\n3. recommended changes to code of practice to incorporate points above mentioned.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident only minor changes to the water deluge system and to the operational arrangement for the on-site emergency plan (for example provision of radio for incident controller) were established."

        "Finish Date": "2002-12-26 14:50:00",
        "Accident Description": "Explosion of an emergency tank when the unit was out of operation during winter (from 24.12.2002).The explosion occurred on the adiabatic production line of nitrobenzene during the time when the system was out of operation due to the cold. The site of the explosion was a storage tank, the purpose of which is a safety drainage of supporting medium from the production line. The storage tank contains two phases - acidic (that means sulphuric acid in the concentration of 70-80 %) and organic (nitrobenzene). Both phases normally contain dissolved nitrophenols and dinitrobenzene in concentrations of up to hundreds of mg/kg. The investigation found that the most probable course of events was as follows: The first factor was the climatic conditions, which lead to the freezing of the route of the waste condensate from the technological steam heating, followed by the penetration of the condensate from the overfilled condenser through the barometric closure into the drainage storage tank with the sulphuric acid. Here, as a consequence of the dissolving temperature on the interface of the acid and organic phase, the temperature gradually increased accompanied by other bypassing exothermic reactions (thermal decomposition of less stable nitrophenols and dinitrobenzene). These reactions increased the temperature on the interface up to the decomposition temperature of nitrobenzene. Thermal decomposition of nitrobenzene was accompanied by a rupture of the storage tank - explosion. An investigation team was appointed in accordance with the operational guidelines of BC MCHZ - Instruction M2 - 26150.doc \"Investigation of extraordinary events\". Results of the investigation are summarized in the report \"Accident of the adiabetic line of the production plant of nitrobenzene\" event.No.1/2003/VS3 from 27.1.2003. Following the comments to A1.Immediately after the explosion, the JHZS BC MCHZ arrived on the scene, followed by other components of IZS. At the same time, the instruction was issued to close the terminal of the rain collector that drains the water to the Odra (remote controlled armature). Information from other interested persons, including technical steps, followed in accordance with the internal emergency plan of BC MCHZ. The explosion of the storage tank in the bottom part of the steel panel construction of the adiabatic line caused damage to the technological constructions of the line in the floors above. There was no fire during the explosion and nobody was injured. The liquid content of the storage tank, partially also in the form of explosion products, was sent flying and most of the liquid phase landed in the retention tank under the line, while a small part fell on the consolidated road, and approx. 1m3 fell on the surrounding snow. The liquid phase froze on the road and snow, and it was possible to clean it up after mixing with sawdust. The contaminated material was deposited on a protected surface in the area BC MCHZ. At the same time an aerosol cloud composed from soot and fine drops of acids formed. Most of the aerosol sedimented in the inner part of the area, while a part was blown to the south and southwest of the plant. The aerosol also hit a high-tension cable- inlet insulators to BC MCHZ, and made them scintillate. They had to be cleaned, leading to a temporary cut in the supply of electricity. Debris was spread up to 90m with one piece (a tube) being found at a distance of 300 m - on the opposite bank of the Odra river. The pressure wave broke windows in the surroundings and damaged the guttering of roofs of the neighbouring objects. ",

As a result of this incident, approximately 30&nbsp;t of coke were ejected.The resulting fire was swiftly brought under control by the on-site fire service with support from the fire brigade.The blast furnace was quickly put in a safe state. In particular, this involves cutting the blast furnace off from the gas network and bringing the cooling system into operation (emergency diesel). In general, jet fires can have two different causes:Failure of the jet tip\u2019s fireproof material:The hot blast (approx. 1&nbsp;200&nbsp;\u00b0C) burns through the jet\u2019s steel casing.In this event, a whistling noise is perceived before material is ejected.Mechanical strain on the blow mould:Formations (iron, burden) inside slide down the furnace wall and can lead to an impact on the blow moulds. This can result in a significant crack occurring at the site of the jet tip in the blow mould, through which a hot blast can escape. In extreme cases, the blow mould can be sucked inside the furnace. In this event, the jet and/or the blow mould spontaneously fails and material is ejected. Effects of the incident:No one was injured. The blast furnace was damaged, particularly in the cable runs and switch units affected by the fire.Furnace gas escaped through the opening in the furnace around the blow mould\u2019s jet and, due to the surrounding conditions (hot gas, red-hot coke, influx of hot air) immediately combusted.The fire caused further visible emissions, largely due to the coke fire and water vapour during firefighting efforts. The smoke cloud drifted towards the river Rhine / Rheinhausen.The water used to extinguish the fire is not thought to have been contaminated with pollutants, as the water was largely used to cool the escaping coke and the parts of the facility.The water ended up on the floor of the smelting works, and from there flowed into the Rhine via the normal drainage system, which is fitted with oil separators.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Based on the water attendant\u2019s description of events (spontaneous incident with no prior whistling noise), it is thought that a jet fire occurred due to mechanical stress on the blow mould caused by formations.",

        "Finish Date": "2004-10-26 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Explosion in centrifugal pump containing Methyl-cyclohexane.According to different statments and observations, it can be assured that:a) The operator suffered a heavy hit by the centrifugal pump cover when it abruptly opened, after deforming and breaking the bolts that closed it to the main body of the centrifugal pump.b) The abrupt opening was consequence of an explosion, due to the low explosivity limits of methyl-cyclohexane. This fact is proved by the deformation and cracks of the bolts and covers.c) The inertization did not avoid the explosion, either because the valve was closed, or because, even if it had been open, the placement of the nitrogen inlet and outlet, at the same level, cannot assure an effective clear of the whole volume of the centrifugal pump, even less for the existing trap and the connection between both.The ignition source is unknown.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Equipment did not include appropriate safety measures. Working procedures did not specify the risk. Inadequate management of dissemination of procedures. Inadequate auditing systems.\n\nBrief description of the event:\nSeparating operation is performed without inertization. There is no indication on whether Nitrogen was connected or not. There was no kind of safety measure in case of absence of nitrogen, since this was not considered in operation procedures. The result was the explosion of the centrifugal pump and death of an operator.It can be indicated, as causes for the explosion the lack of efficient inertization of the centrifugal pump, lack of risk analysis and lack of operating procedures, along with an efficient system for risk control and inspection. According to the data available, the inspector reporting states that, had the establishment had documentation conforming and implementing RD 1254/1999, it would have been very unlikely that the accident would have taken place, so it cannot be excluded as a cause for the accident the failure of the establishment to comply with the law.Apart from material causes for the accident, other organisational causes must be studied. In this sense, it is reflected that:a) There had been no hazard analyses from the establishment regarding the centrifugal pumps working with solvents, required for this type of installations.b) There was not a clear working procedure specifying the hazards related to the activity.c) The operator did not have a specific preparation for the task, and his instructions were communicated to him by a person in charge.d) The inspection and / or internal control system took care of basic aspects of safety at work prevention but did not consider any element related to the risk of an explosion. Moreover such inspection was done by personnel in charge of production, not related to safety aspects.",
        "Consequences": "1 operator died, 300.000 euros \n\nThe room where the centrifugal pump was placed was destroyed, along with other equipment present there.The extent of the consequences was limited to the centrifugal pump room, which was partially destroyed.&nbsp;Affected Area: installationPeople - remarks: The explosion opened the centrifugal pump cover which broke the skull of the operator working with it. Workers both from the establishment as well as others from outside used fire extinguishers to extinguish the fire generated afterwards and took care of the victim, who was taken to a hospital, but he died at the entranceEcological harm - remarks: None, given that the remainder of the explosion and subsequent fire ended up on a waterproof floor and were drained to a safe place for treatment inside the establishment.",
        "Emergency response": "The rest of the centrifugal pumps will be adapted to essential health\nand safety requirements, this will be supervised by OCA.\nA new circuit for inertization will be designed, with flow control and\noxygen control blocking the start-up. A lock for the centrifugal pump\nwill be provided, along with new operating procedures and evaluation of\nknowledge of the operator in charge.Official action taken - legal action: A sanctioning proceeding is open for failure of Safety Management System, regarding procedures for operations, control of substances and auditing.

        "Finish Date": "2016-08-01 14:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "A fire broke out in a fertiliser warehouse of a biogas plant at approximately 18.00 on 31 July 2016. The warehouse includes a storage room for dried digestate and a digestate drying process, including air scrubbing and a sulphuric acid tank required for this process. The fire in the digestate drying process resulted in the release of biogas as a result of the emergency flare being shut down so that the fire could be extinguished. In addition, the fire in the drying hall destroyed the acid tank and sulphuric acid leaked out.\nSafety measure:31 July 2016, approx. 18:30: Once the plant manager arrived, the gas pipes leading to the combined heat and power plant (CHP) plant were closed and the CHP plant was shut down.\n31 July 2016, approx. 18:45: The electricity was switched off to protect the firefighters, thereby consciously turning off the emergency flare. Using water, etc. made it imperative that the site be completely free of electrical tension. This also meant that an existing portable back-up power generator could not be connected either, for safety reasons.\n(As a result, the biogas could not be used for energy purposes or burned via the gas flare. Once the gas storage tank\u2019s maximum gas storage volume was reached, the excess quantities of biogas had to be released into the atmosphere via the tank\u2019s excess pressure release system.)\n1 August 2016, approx. 12:00: In order to speed up cooling and prevent the formation of ember nests, the dried digestate was recovered from the hall.\n1 August 2016, approx. 14:30: Fire site given the all-clear. The electricity connection was then directly re-established and the flare re-engaged.\nIn order to ensure the operation of the flare, an emergency power generator was provided. The fire site remained closed off until 2 August 2016 for investigations by the Criminal Police.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Due to what was presumed to be spontaneous combustion of digestate, the release of biogas in the fire area had to be prevented to safeguard the plant.Accordingly, the entire biogas supply was shut off. This could only be achieved by closing the main pipe at the fermenter, so that no biogas could reach the gas flare. As a result, the biogas was not flared but released into the atmosphere via the excess pressure release system.\nAmbient release of biogas resulting from the loss of electrical power due to a fire in a neighbouring hall.",
        "Consequences": "The fire caused material damage to the fertiliser warehouse and digestate drying [equipment].\nTwo firefighters were sent to hospital as a precaution. After examinations of their respiratory tracts, they were released in good health after a few hours.",
        "Emergency response": "- During the events, protective measures by the operator were not possible (see safety measures).- Retrieval of dried digestate from the fertiliser storage hall to prevent further formation of ember nests.- Restoration of the power supply after the all-clear was given at the fire site. As a result, the flare was brought back into operation.- Ensuring that flare operation is guaranteed by providing an emergency power generator.Measurement by the fire brigade of the sulphur [dioxide] content of the air downwind.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to reduce the risk of fire in the vicinity of the biogas plant:- Modernisation of drying equipment. In future, a so-called Mississippi dryer will be used instead of a belt dryer. Instead of completely drying part of the digestate to a dry matter content of 98%, the digestate is only concentrated and then pumped back to the repository. In future, therefore, there will be no need to store dried digestate. Moreover, unlike the belt dryer technology, there are as yet no known cases of fire caused by a Mississippi dryer.- The storage of sulphuric acid in large quantities is also no longer necessary. Although H2SO4 is still needed, it is no longer stored in advance but delivered in IBC containers as required.- A meeting was organised. The operator, the competent administrative authority, the local mayor and the officers of the nearby voluntary fire brigades took part. It was possible to put together a number of recommendations on how the operator could optimise the conditions for fire extinguishing operations. In particular, the operator has agreed to extend the local area\u2019s fire-fighting pond and thus improve the supply situation of the entire local area.On 6 October 2016 an external institute was commissioned to update the existing fire protection plan. The above-mentioned requirements are included in the planning application and will be implemented in the reconstruction.\nMeasures to prevent biogas emission:- An emergency generator on the plant site continues to provide additional safety of electricity supply to the plant and to the gas flare.- The use of a gas camera confirmed the integrity of the gas storage membrane.- As part of the process of increasing flexibility, the operator plans to build another external gas storage tank on the site. Therefore, should a similar case arise, the biogas would be diverted to the external gas storage tank instead of being incinerated by the gas flare or released through pressure relief system."

In the continuous tar distillation plant several distillation columns separate the previously mechanically dewatered coal tars into primary fractions. Here the distillative processing of the coal-tar also called raw tar is performed.Presently it is assumed that the failure of a flex-hose in the fluid seal system of a circulation pump caused the ignition of a primary fire followed by a deflagration.

        "Accident Description": "At 07:55 a strong explosion inside a tank occurred during the unloading of nitric acid from a road tanker, followed by the release of a cloud with a yellow/red colour. The cloud had a strong smell and caused irritation of the eyes and skin. The main pollutants were nitrogen oxides. It seems that, by mistake, the operator connected the road tanker to the wrong tank, i.e. he emptied the nitric acid into a tank containing formic acid. The mixing of the two acids produced a rapid exothermic reaction that led to the explosion. The man attending the operation was killed by the explosion. Few minutes later the fire brigade intervened (using personal breathing apparatuses and protective clothing), diluted the liquid acid on the ground with water and created a containment to prevent the acid spreading over on the ground. Nebulized water was also used to dilute the nitrogen oxides vapours. In the meantime the evolution of the cloud (directed towards the sea) was continuously observed from a helicopter. Personnel on the helicopter relieved that the cloud was rapidly dispersing in about 100 metres from the source of release. At about 12:00 the concentration of the cloud, diluted by the action of wind, was no more dangerous.The exploded tank was cut along the inferior weld; some parts have been found at about 50 metres away while the top flange in which the relief valves were installed was found at about 100 metres away. Two other empty tanks, nearby to the exploded one, were found at 25 metres from the point where the accident occurred. The road tanker struck a wall. Some buildings inside the establishment suffered extensive damages. Some walls and roofs inside the establishment were put down. Broken windows were found up to 300 metres away. Road traffic around the establishment was prohibited for some hours. The water to the water treatment plant of Bari Sud, connected with the Chimica d'Agostino factory, reached a low pH (about 3.5) and returned to pH=7 after the intervention of fire brigade in diluting the liquid acid on the ground with water.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:It seems that, during the unloading of nitric acid from a road tanker, by mistake, the operator connected the tanker with the wrong tank, i.e. he emptied the nitric acid into a tank containing formic acid. The mixing of the two acids produced a rapid exothermic reaction that led to the explosion of the tank followed by the release of a cloud with a yellow/red colour. Under these hypotheses the tank explosion could be explained because the reaction between the formic acid (a reducing substance) and the nitric acid (a strong oxidizing substance) is very rapid and highly exothermic and leads to the formation of water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The operator's error in the unloading operation was caused by an inadequate training/instruction together with an insufficient operating procedures (code 5303).",

        "Accident Description": " An explosion occurred during the pumping of waste water (which contained organic peroxides) out from a tank. One worker died following the injuries.About 9 a.m. a worker started preparing wastewater (from extraction process) in the IBC container for pumping to a storage tank which was emptied.IBC container (with the volume of 1 m3) with wastewater from drying process containing app. 2% of active oxygen, including app. 0.5% coming from organic peroxides, was storied from the end of January 2010. Wastewater was not systematically analyzed for its physical and chemical state.About 9:30, before a break, the worker placed a pipe of a rotor pump in the IBC container.After the break, the worker took the pump's motor/engine and went to the place where water was to be pumped.Due to the damages which appeared after the explosion it was not established whether the worker made the equipotential connection between the IBC container, pump and storage tank for technological sewage.About 10:00 a.m. the explosion occurred. The external (steel) and internal (plastic) parts of a container burst, its elements were thrown away and the liquid splattered.Due to the explosion the worker was badly injured and died.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The causes of the accident were as follows:- long storage period of waste water containing organic peroxides resulted in its separation in the bottom of the IBBC container;- lack of physical and chemical analysis of the properties of the substance;- use of a rotary pump (for pumping waste water) resulted in putting in motion organic peroxides (which separated at the bottom of the container) as well as the occurrence of the friction phenomenon and electrification of liquid;- lack of safety instruction for safe pumping of waste water, including possible accidental situations;- lack of analysis taking into consideration possible occurrence of the organic peroxides in the place where waste water is being pumped.",
        "Consequences": "Due to the explosion one worker died. Explosion caused the internal (plastic) part of the container rupture causing more damage to the bottom part and a complete rupture and deformation of the external steel cover.\u00a0",

        "Accident Description": "Fire in a pyrolysis furnaceinitiating event/ accident dynamics: Pipe rupture in the cracking pipe system with release&nbsp; of hydrocarbons, which ignited in contact with the hot parts of the furnace;Description of the event:The ethylene plant was operating with a load of 192 t/h of naphtha. &nbsp;At 7:30 h the motor of one of the fresh air fans of the steam-generator had to be shut down due to operating problems. When the spare air fan was connected, the control valves opened, the lambda value of the combustion process no longer met&nbsp; the set values causing the automatic shut-down of the steam boiler. During start-up operations of the steam boiler a supply shortage of steam at 110 bar occurred causing the shut-down of one of the steam fed raw gas compressors. The excess steam had to be directed to a flare for approximately one hour.At 14:00 h the electricians requested the start-up of the repaired&nbsp; air fan motor for functional testing. The fact that the control valves of the fan were directly coupled to the rotational speed of the motor and not to the rotational speed of the fan was not taken into consideration This caused a recurrence of the situation that had occurred in the morning. Due to the fact that the steam boiler could not be started up in time the excess&nbsp; raw gas had to be directed again to the flare.Additional steam equipment operating on steam had to be shut-down in order to stabilise the high pressure steam supply situation, e.g. all steam fed boiler water pumps were shut-down. Out of 5 boiler water pumps only 2 pumps remained operative, which was sufficient for the existing loadAt 14:30 h in one of the boiler water pumps a 6 kV arc over occurred between power supply and pump motor, causing the failure of that pump.With only one pump functioning, the feed water supply of the last operating boiler was no longer guaranteed.The last steam generator was shut down when the signal \"feed water level to low\" was displayed. This led to the emergency shut-down of the last operating pyrolysis furnace; the shut down of the ground flare and the operation of the high-flare without steam injection. Operating the high-flare without steam significantly increased soot emissions with respect to normal operation. The high-flare was fed from then onwards with the evaporating refrigerants (ethylene, propylene) from the refrigeration circuits mixed with residual substances present in the refrigerated part of the ethylene plant.During a walk round the plant at approximately 17:30 the plant personnel noticed flames spreading from the furnace and alerted the on-site fire-brigade.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The furnace was operating under normal conditions when the plant was\nshut down (emergency shut-down from central control station) at\napproximately 14:00 h due to a disturbance in the steam generation\nsystem of the plant.Causes according to present knowledge: A pipe rupture occurred due to thermal stress after shutting down the furnace via the emergency shut down system. Flammable substances were released  in the still hot furnace chamber and ignited on still hot parts of the furnace. There was not enough steam for the necessary flushing of the furnace due to the disturbance in the steam generation system.\n\nCause classification: steam pressure failure for cooling and flushing process.\n",
        "Consequences": "Onsite Material losses \n- damage to cracking tube systems;\n- destruction of spare tube bundles in the convection area as well as destruction of the floor-  and side wall burners;\n- damage to the refractory lining of the furnace and to the furnace shell, exhaust gas blower/ silencer.\n",
        "Emergency response": "Safety function: The furnace was isolated from the cracking gas system after the release of products and consequent ignition. The heating gas system, the naphtha system, the steam system and the oil quench system had been isolated during the first shut down operation. Emergency measures/ protection measures: Emergency response operation of the on-site fire fighting team, cooling of the cracking furnace with fixed and mobile monitors.Material damage remediation: reconstruction of the furnace utilising parts of equipment still functioning.Protective measures\n- emergency response of the on-site fire fighting team;\n- cooling of the cracking furnace with fixed and mobile monitors.\nMaterial damage remediation: Reconstruction of the furnace utilising still functioning parts of equipment.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: - improve the reliability of the steam supply system- use of modified materials for the cracking tubes-Review:&nbsp;the maintenance plans and functional test plans, -the release procedures after maintenance and repair operations,-the&nbsp; shut-down procedures of the pyrolytic furnaces-the monitoring systems for detecting abnormal operating conditions-the management of change system&nbsp;"

        "Accident Description": "When testing fire extinguishing equipment on an adjacent tank, the fire extinguisher for the toluene tank was accidentally loaded with water and activated due to incorrect labelling on the extinguishing agent distribution system outside the tank pit. This caused a fire extinguishing hose in the toluene tank to unroll.\nThe hose, made from a non-conductive synthetic material, presumably released an electrostatic charge when it came into contact with the low-conductivity product (toluene). This charge was most likely sufficient to ignite the explosive atmosphere present in the tank under normal operating conditions.\nThe pressure of the explosion tore off the top of the fixed-roof tank, leading to a tank fire with soot (black carbon) emissions.\nThe fire was fought by the plant\u2019s own fire service with support from external professional and industry fire services.\nFire brigade and police deployment, measurements (hydrocarbons, toluene) around the area of the incident and outside the plant, blocking off the tank, extinguishing the fire using foam, cooling the adjacent tanks by spraying with water, retention of the used water in the tank retention ponds, temporary suspension of rail traffic.",

        "Lesson Learned": "\nThe labelling of all extinguishing equipment on site was checked. No more incorrect labels were found. In the regular annual checks on the fire protection equipment on tanks, labels and pipe layout will also be checked.\nThe deficiencies identified in checks on the adjacent tanks were rectified promptly. The damaged toluene tank was dismantled and the tank retention pond was cleaned. The cleaning measures recommended by the geotechnical engineer were carried out.\nThe manufacturer of the semi-subsurface extinguishing system was informed that, in plants with similar storage conditions and similar substances, incorrect deployment of the fire extinguishing equipment could produce an ignition source.\nThe manufacturer is currently testing the possibility of replacing the existing hose with one made out of a conductive material. Until the outcome is known, organisational measures will be taken at the plant to ensure that the fire extinguishing equipment is not set off by accident (checks on labelling, cable fuses on the final valves on the tank).\nIf it proves possible to substitute the hose material and if tests confirm the material\u2019s suitability, technical documentation can be drawn up to provide proof of suitability and enable the purchase of new and replacement parts.\nThe layout of the semi-subsurface fire extinguishing equipment in the toluene tank was examined by an expert and clearly presented. The examination did not reveal any work that was required.. The ignition sources analysis for the tank farm affected by the fire will be reviewed. Generally applicable points will be incorporated into an overarching explosion protection document, which will be finalised by the end of 2015.\n\n\nThe testing basis, scope and intervals and the format of the test reports for the equipment in each department are laid down using the findings from the ignition source analysis. Furthermore, the instructions for testing staff (those authorised to carry out tests, authorised experts, etc.) will be laid down and links will be created to quickly locate testing documents.\n\nWith regard to public safety, a D3 announcement will be made at an early stage for future incidents with a comparable external impact."

        "Finish Date": "2001-05-14 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The company is specialised in producing animal food from cereals and press cakes. The installation was built in 1989. The raw materials are stored in silos before grinding and mixing operations. The finished product is then sent in bulk or in bags.The site is classified with an authorisation, issued with prefectoral order of 19th June 1989, mainly for grinding vegetable substances. The site does not fall within the scope of the Seveso Directive.The accident: A violent explosion occurred in correspondence with the handling tower.The accident is classified at level 2 of the accident gravity scale due to the fact that one employee died as a result of the explosion.This kind of accident is unfortunately not an exceptional event. The accident is notified with the objective of ensuring that this kind of situation is better known and taken more into consideration.The accidentAt 10:00 h on 14th May 2001 a truck arrived at the plant to deliver 29 t of colza press cakes. The driver started unloading operations in the receiving pit of the brick silo (storage hangar).At the same time two workers started working on the delivery redler conveyor of the brick silo, trying to repair the scraper driving chain. The repair operation consisted in cutting the chain and welding some links after removing the redler conveyor cover on the side facing the pit.A violent explosion occurred at 11:15 h.The truck driver who was near the discharging platform was slightly burned. The two workers in the pit were seriously injured (3rd degree burns). One worker managed to get out of the pit on his own. He activated the emergency shut-down switch of the handling tower. His colleagues made him sit on a chair while waiting for the emergency response service. The emergency response service arrived approximately 10 minutes after having been called. The other worker was lying unconscious in the pit. He was brought out after 1/2 hour by the fire brigade.The explosion was heard in the neighbourhood and was followed by a fire in the pit, in the hopper and in the areas of the tower and the gallery above the cells.The hot gases and/or incandescent particles ignited the dust deposits in the air circulation system of the cylindrical silos located a few meters away but a few meters above the horizontal silos. The fire fighters were alerted by the smoke plumes and intervened rapidly to fight the fire, thus avoiding the propagation of the fire to the vertical cylindrical storage cells.The explosion blew over half the roofing of the structure away and tore the walls of the tower open. Pieces of fibro-cement roofing panels were found at 30 m distance and several metal rods of the staircase giving access to the vertical silos were severed.The descending duct of the bucket conveyor employed for the silage of the press cakes was ripped open over a length of 4 m at the bottom of the pit section as well as at 2/3 height of the tower.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident originated from infringing the basic prevention rules for grain storage installations.Cleaning operations of the premises had not been performed. Large quantities of grain and dust accumulated in the pits, on all surfaces, forming layers which in some places reached several dozens of centimetres.A maintenance operation involving metal welding and grinding was performed in a confined space, a fire permit was signed as a pure formality without performing any cleaning operation. The workers performed the operation on the delivery redler conveyor while the elevator bucket conveyor was operating. Inside the bucket conveyor the atmosphere was saturated with dust.The discharging operation of the truck was almost concluded and welding and grinding operations had been finished when the explosion occurred.Based on the analysis of the elements gathered on the accident site and tests performed, the competent authorities consider the following accident scenario as most probable:- Initially several metal particles deriving from the grinding operations were projected and fell * either on the bottom of the pit igniting one or more combustion spots .........* or in the chutes of the conveyor before coming into contact with the dusty atmosphere of the descending side of an elevator. Holes have been found in some junction boxes and switching boxes of the handling equipment which may have allowed such a pathway.- Following this* a primary explosion occurred in a descending duct of the elevator (conveyor) at the level of the handling tower pit;* the explosion in the elevator spread to the handling tower pit due to suspension of the dust present in the pit; * the rupture of the shell of the descending duct of the elevator in correspondence with the second level of the handling tower propagated the explosion throughout the entire tower.* at the same time the explosion in the pit affected the upper part of the tower through the openings* the explosion of the tower spread towards the rest of the storage and the roofing structure.The pit in which the explosion occurred is a strategic maintenance node were the feeding and extraction systems serving the entire silo system of the company are localised and are in communication.As far as the operator is concerned the most probable cause of the accident was a blocked rotating element of the elevator which may have caused the explosion by overheating.",
        "Consequences": "Two workers performing maintenance operations in the pit of the handling tower were seriously injured, a third person the truck driver delivering rape-seed cakes was slightly affected. Material damage was considerable. ",
        "Emergency response": "An urgent prefectoral decree of 16th June 2001 by the Prefect of the Somme region ordered:- that the authorisation to resume the activity of the whole installation for receiving, handling, storing and transforming grains as well as animal feeds operated by the company be subject to: * proof by the operator of strict compliance with all relevant regulations * updating of the safety report of the site according to article 3 of the decree of 21 September 1977 * resuming the activities of the transfer chamber affected by the accident be subject to the delivery of the safety report in compliance with article 38 of the decree of 21 September 1977, specifying the precise conditions under which measures have been implemented to avoid the recurrence of such an accident.The company submitted a safety report on 28th June 2001 and subsequently documented the stages in the compliance of the installation. Operation of the maize silos and the brick silos was authorised progressively.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Onsite the following prevention measures were taken in relation to the pit affected by the accident- simplifying the communication node of the silos - installing a vent on top of the elevator covering all the duct surface and connected to the external atmosphere; the bottom part of the elevator is equipped with surfaces which can be cleaned with compressed air. - the concrete slab of the brick silos ground -floor (ceiling of the elevator pit) has been replaced by a metal structure - separating the reception pit from the silos underground gallery by installing a door - separating the handling tower from the upper cell sections by means of steel lining in order to reduce dust depositing in the tower and limit the propagation of a secondary explosion in case of accident. - creation of position of safety managerIn a wider context the accident occurred in a cereal storage installation which, after the accident at Blaye, had been subject to the intervention of the Classified Installation Inspectorate and to a series of administrative and criminal proceedings. These proved to be insufficient to oblige the operator to take the hazards of the activity correctly into account and to comply in the longer term with the safety regulations. This kind of installation needs permanent monitoring and maintenance of safety procedures.The Regional Inspectorate for Classified Installations (DRIRE) of the Piccardy region has set up an operation called \"Silos\", consisting in the systematic inspection of all registered silos subject to authorisation over a period of three months. The prefects and the representatives of the professional associations were given advance warning of this operation.Certain reactions opposing the implementation of certain clauses of the ministerial decree of 29th July 1998 were encountered in the first sites inspected. The collective awareness of the problem and of the need to handle the risk at its source however developed rapidly, thanks also to the psychological impact of the ALBET accident, which followed the accident at BLAYE, and to the collective, systematic and demonstrative character of the operation.This explains why at beginning of the operation the average number of non-conformities found during the inspections was 7 whereas it dropped to 4 in August for the last inspections.During this campaign a total of 100 silos with a capacity of more than 15 000 m3 were inspected&nbsp;- 93 reports were issued for 567 offences&nbsp;- 94 proposals were submitted to the prefects &nbsp;- the main non-conformities found were related to the detection of malfunctioning, to the electric systems and to the conveyor systems"

        "Accident Title": "Loss of containment  and oil spill in groundwater from an oil tank",
        "Start Date": "2017-02-03 00:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "2017-03-02 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The event was verified on February 3, 2017, when a monitoring well located outside the perimeter of the plant was interested by the presence of water contaminated by hydrocarbons that flowed into a sewage pipeline to the consortium treatment plant. The discovery of the hydrocarbons in the monitoring well was possible thanks to the report of technicians of the&nbsp;consortium informing of the presence&nbsp;in the&nbsp; treatment plant of waters seemingly polluted by hydrocarbons. Further investigations (excavations inside the plant area and inspections of sewers outside it) led to the discovery of a widespread groundwater contamination combined with the presence of hydrocarbons at external sewers and consequently the assessing of the existence of an occurring uncontrolled emission of hydrocarbons involving subsoil and aquifer underlying the plant as well as a migration of contamination in areas outside its perimeter.The results of the surveys carried out on the tanks after their dismantling for the installation of the double hulls made it possible to ascertain that the event consisted in:\n&nbsp;- loss of containment of one tank caused by corrosion of the bottom,\n&nbsp;- product leakage in the layers underlying the bottom of the tank itself (foundation side) for the probable presence of cracks in the bituminous (flexible) sheath presumably due to the contact&nbsp;with the annular (rigid) concrete foundation.\nThis caused the vertical migration of crude oil from the unsaturated zone to the underlying saturated&nbsp; zone (freatic acquifer) at about 6 meters in depth. Subsequently, the presence below the oil tank of a preferential horizontal way of drainage of groundwater, consisting of the intubated and underground tract of a paleo-ditch, favored the drainage and rapid migration of the hydrocarbon plume into separate phase in the southwest direction and its extension outside the perimeter of the plant.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Analyzing the events that followed and which led to the leak of about 400 tons of crude oil and the contamination of more than 26,000 square meters of groundwater, the following can be assumed:\na) Failure of the primary protection system: damage to the bottom of the tank caused by a corrosive phenomenon that generated the formation of passing-through holes and the loss of containment of the tank.The surveys carried out on N. 3 tanks assessed that the loss of containment and consequent oil product emissions in the subsoil is to be attributed to some passing-through holes found at the bottom of only one tank caused by corrosion:\u2022 No. 1 hole through diameter of 20 mm,\u2022 No. 1 hole through diameter of 3 mm,\u2022 a truncated area (extending approximately 100x50 mm) affected by very high porosity including n. 7 passing-through holes with variable dimensions of 3 to 5 mm, and a last hole (near the entrance door) with a dimension of about 10 mm. Investigations on the other 2 tanks&nbsp; excluded the presence of passing-through holes. The 4th tank was already equipped with a double bottom since 2013. It is not plausible the involving of sewage networks and drainage as a cause of contamination, because following surveys carried out by the operator had not reported damage in the waste water sewerage system.b) Failure of the secondary protection system: damage to the asphalt sheath resulting in cracking.The causes that favored vertical migration into the underlying layers of the tank bottom are due to the probable damage to the waterproof layer consisting of a bituminous conglomerate for a thickness of about 80 mm&nbsp;below this. Non-destructive investigations carried out with the georadar probe during the installation of double bottoms on the tank led the operator to exclude&nbsp;voids below the foundation, although it should be considered that this instrumentation does not allow to identify cracks in the sizeof the order of mm. It is very likely that such cracks&nbsp;had been generated by&nbsp; the contact&nbsp; of two materials with different behavior at stresses (bituminous layer with less rigid behavior in contact&nbsp;with&nbsp;rigid concrete foundation).Probably the bituminous conglomerate of low strength, subjected to the continuous vertical pressures of the product at the bottom of the tank (variable depending on the degree of filling) tends to deform and break at the contact with the&nbsp; harder concrete foundation, causing detachment of the asphalt layer.c) Failure of alarm systems to prevent and / or mitigate the event and to signal the&nbsp;uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons.The containment losses of primary and secondary protection systems allowed the vertical migration of crude oil into the underlying layers of bituminous conglomerate consisting of honeycomb and compacted hollow mix of thickness of 1 meter and 2 meters respectively.The vertical migration of the crude oil proceeds from the unsaturated zone to the saturated one&nbsp; (aquifer) until it reaches the groundwater table at about 5-6 meters in depth. Subsequently, the presence below the tank of a preferential horizontal drainage pathway of groundwater, consisting of the presence of an intubated and underground tract of a paleo-ditch favored the drainage and rapid migration of the hydrocarbon plume into separate phase in the southwest direction.The event was verified on 3 February 2017 when the extent of contamination had already reached the areas outside of the plant.",
        "Consequences": "The loss of containment of about 400 tons of crude oil caused as a result the formation of LNAPL product on the groundwater table and their contamination for an extension of about 26,000 square meters. Contamination is intended as&nbsp;an overrun of the standards in force in the field of quality / protection / groundwater reclamation. At present it is not possible to determine the volume of saturated / unsaturated soil affected by contamination.",
        "Emergency response": "On site and off site\nAfter being noticed on 3 February 2017 of the presence of Hydrocarbons in the sewage, the operator undertook the following actions:\n\n-&nbsp;notifications to the authorities required by the IPPC and Seveso (External Emergency Plan) regulations;\n- identification of&nbsp;the route of the piping connected to the sewage well outside the establishment, and&nbsp;of the nature and origin of the contaminant;\n- interception downstream of the sewage system by inflatable septum;&nbsp;\n- excavation of a trench&nbsp;on the internal side of the establishment in order to intercept any contaminated flow;\n- installation of&nbsp;piezometers in order to better define the conceptual model and possible contamination and its distribution;\n- analysis of sub soil and water taken during investigations;\n- under&nbsp;control of the competent authorities,&nbsp; starting of&nbsp;the remediation of the polluted soil, subsoil and groundwater.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;Subsequently the operator provided for the following corrective actions:\n\n- update of the evaluation of risk associated with the tank oil spill;\n- double bottom installation on the crude oil storage tanks;\n- implementation of an Extraordinary Maintenance Plan;\n- update of the tank storage operational control procedure;\n-&nbsp;integrity check of buried pipelines;\n- update/issue of concerned&nbsp;HSE IMS procedures taking into account the event occurred:\n\n-periodic inspections on sewage networks\n-identification of critical elements/equipment for the environment\n-safety procedures operational control\n-environmental operational control\n-management of accidents, injuries, near miss, medical treatments, first aid cases and unsafe acts/conditions\n-management of the&nbsp;operational emergency safety measures.\n-operative control procedure for emergency safety barriers and piezometers\n-implementation of surface water monitoring procedure for external areas outside the establishment\n-implementation of the management scheme for the management of oil spills with external impact\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",
        "Lesson Learned": "The causes of the accident are mainly due to weaknesses in risk assessment in relation to:\n\u2022 shortcomings in the assessment of risks in terms of consequences;\n\u2022 deficiencies in the control of the corrosion phenomenon, in the application of the results of the operational experience and in the revaluation of tanks maintenance frequencies;\n\u2022 shortcomings in the adoption of \"compensatory\" preventive / protection measures in the waves of completion of the works for the realization of double funds.\nIn practice, the technical/management safety measures adopted by the operator such as:\u2022 Passive tank protection systems (sacrificial anode) combined with day-to-day control of basin integrity and possible loss from tank trunking;\u2022 control of water content below the 0.2% threshold;\u2022 Moving the bottom of the tanks through agitators to avoid both the separation of water from the oil and the consequent increase in the corrosive processes of the bottom due to the aggressiveness of the water;\u2022 the use of corrosion inhibitors;\u2022 Immediate action in the emergency responce,were considered sufficient by the operator to ensure the integrity of the tanks during the foreseen maintenance period (10 years) and to estimate that the risk of environmental consequences stemming from these events was still limited and that the potential impact could affect a limited portion of surface, even in the worst conditions.\n\nHowever, as early as 2013, after 5 years after the first extraordinary maintenance, there was a loss of containment from 2 tanks. This led the operator to adopt as a definitive protective measure the creation of the double bottom of the first&nbsp; tank and the repair of the trunk of the second one.These events should have led the operator to prevent uncontrolled crude oil releases, to re-evaluate the reliability of its tanks and to adjust maintenance frequencies in relation to its operational experience, that is to say, in view of the the predictions of the state of degradation of tank bottoms.\nThe analysis produced by the operator for the purpose of assessing the consequences of a possible loss of containment and therefore in terms of vertical and horizontal migration speeds of contamination have not been reflected in reality due to the presence of the intubated tract of a buried stream passing accross the plant. Such a channel, the existence of which was not known, constituted a real preferred drainage pathway, with very high hydraulic conductivity in relation to the context, which was necessary for mapping and which would have to be taken into account in calculating the magnitude of the consequences ( horizontal migration speed and extension of contamination).\nDuring the implementation of the mandatory maintenance plan (requested by Authority in 2013) aimed to improve the tank protection equipment (double fund installation), the operator should have promptly implemented&nbsp; at least technical prevention/protection measures of a \"compensatory\" type, or preventing/monitoring leakage of product from the bottom of the tanks without double bottom and/or mitigate the consequences of such losses (also in the light of the events occurring on other 2 two tank in 2013).\n&nbsp;\n"

        "Accident Description": "On 27 September, 2012, a major leak of hydrofluoric acid (HF) occurred at the Hube Global chemicals factory in the city of Gumi in South Korea1. Five workers were killed and a further 18 seriously affected. Two workers were on the top of a tanker containing HF. They were preparing to connect a flexible air hose to a valve on the tanker top in order to offload it to the plant by pressurisation. While they were working with connections on the tanker,about 8 tonnes of HF erupted at high pressure from the tanker and rapidly spread to the surrounding atmosphere. The two workers were engulfed in the fumes, thrown from the top of the tanker and killed. Two other workers repairing a pump at ground level near the tanker were also killed as was an employee in a nearby office. Another eighteen workers were injured or affected by HF fumes. There were large- scale effects on the surrounding area, with at least 3000 members of the public reporting symptoms associated with inhaling the fumes, and widespread damage to crops and livestock. Six hundred local residents, within 300 metres of the incident, were evacuated from their homes and 700 workers in the area were provided with respiratory protection masks.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The possibility that the two operators on the tanker top thought that the tanker was empty not full was mooted. There is no evidence of this, but why a full tanker might have been about to be offloaded in a plant that actually produced HF, is not clear.",
        "Consequences": "About 8 tonnes of HF erupted at high pressure from the tanker and rapidly spread to the surrounding atmosphere. The two workers were engulfed in the fumes, thrown from the top of the tanker and killed. Two other workers repairing a pump at ground level near the tanker were also killed as was an employee in a nearby office. Another eighteen workers were injured or affected by HF fumes. The cloud of HF spread over a large part of the rest of the industrial site and caused many firms to shut down. It then spread to the surrounding area, affecting about 500 acres of farmland and some 3000 livestock. The local population also suffered significant distress, with at least 3000 people being treated for symptoms including nausea, vomiting, chest pains, rashes and sore eyes or throats due to inhalation of the fumes. The overall cost of the damage has been estimated at between $15.9 - $20M (&pound;9.9 &ndash; 12.5M). The acid corroded over 1100 vehicles. On 08 October, 2012 the South Korean government declared Gumi and the surrounding area to be a &ldquo;special disaster area&rdquo; thus making residents eligible for financial compensation and aid to recover losses.",
        "Emergency response": "Municipal firefighters arrived without knowing the exact nature of the accident and without adequate protection (mask and acid suit). They water the leak with water, thus worsening the product release. Called in firefighters from the nearest American military base shall ensure themselves the closure of the circulation around the plant to prevent residents and cars circulate through the toxic cloud that formed. They alert the local police to continue this work and is responsible for the evacuation of the population within 1.5 km. The slow response of the authorities has been criticized, the 300 residents directly affected being evacuated until 10 days after the accident, as well as insufficient resources available to the emergency, including the lack of neutralizing agents (lime) during the first 22 intervention hours. Within 20 km, declared \"disaster area\" land must be cleared in the following weeks, as well as buildings. Riparian evacuees will be an epidemiological study. The first evidence gathered by the police records from a surveillance camera of the transfer station and review of the tanker crashed in particular, show that two employees are mounted on the tank to connect the air hose designed to drive acid in the tank from the tank; one branch air hose, while the second to save time begins to loosen the bolts on the valve buffer output of acid. The latter then accidentally struck the arm of the manual outlet valve, which opens partially allowing the HF pressure to spring. In road transport, internal pressure would have formed by thermal expansion of the product.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Unveiling closed-circuit footage, police said that the workers who died in the accident were presumed to have not been abiding by safety regulations nor wearing protective working clothes.An increases attention to the work safety procedures by the management and an adequate information training of the workers could have result in a reduction of the risk and outcome."

        "Finish Date": "2017-05-06 01:09:00",
        "Accident Description": "On 5 May 2017 at 19:33:A leak from a pipeline bridge was reported. The fire brigade\u2019s investigation revealed that this was a DN 50 pipeline containing trichlorosilane.The pipeline was decompressed and shut off by the supplier. Due to the length of the pipe bridge and the distances between the shut-off valves, a large residual volume remained in the piping.Loudspeaker announcements were immediately made in parts of the plant instructing people not to leave or enter buildings (gas alarm).Measurements from the measurement bus, which was immediately deployed, showed no elevated values, neither for hydrogen chloride nor for other substances. The fire brigade used turbo extinguishers to precipitate the gas cloud; this was very successful.\nHowever, the gas alarm was maintained as a precaution until the fire brigade had given its final report back on the closed-off pipeline.\nDue to the difficulty accessing the site of the leak, due to the presence of a pipe holder directly at the site of the leak and the formation of a solidified silicic acid crust at the exit point, the works fire brigade was able to seal the leak at 23:30 using a sleeve. The pipe was then pressure-flushed with nitrogen and emptied into a blow-down tank.After checking that the sleeve provided a tight seal, at 23:59 the cordon was reduced to the immediate surroundings.\nThe all-clear was given at 01:09 on 6 May 2017.\nSafety measures:The pipeline does not have a special safety system for leakages.For measures taken, see causes/course of event.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The substance leaked out through a breach in the pipe wall.A material check of the section of pipeline in question, the cause was corrosion from outside.The corrosion location was directly under a pipe support and therefore not visible.\nExternal corrosion on an outdoor pipe bridge. An adjacent salt discharge point (NaCl) also caused a corrosive atmosphere in this part of the pipe bridge.",
        "Consequences": "Damage to the affected pipeline as well as to adjacent pipelines and the pipe bridge.",
        "Emergency response": "See causes/course of event. In addition, the operator\u2019s response team:\n\nsent appropriate D1 messages,\ninformed representatives of the authorities (e.g. civil protection, police, local council) by telephone,\nanswered questions from the public on the helpline,\nsent out a press release.\n\nReplacement of the section of pipeline and inspection of the pipe bridge by an independent expert before putting it back into service. Cleaning and repair of the pipe bridge and pipelines in the affected area and the immediate surroundings.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nDuring the leak, the measuring station could not ascertain quickly enough exactly which operational unit the pipe bridge in question belonged to. This caused a delay in shutting down the pumps and pressure lines, which allowed the release of trichlorosilane to continue.In order to allow for a faster shut down and flushing of bridge pipelines, an emergency plan (with exact location and layout of the pipe\u2019s valves and facilities for flushing it) for each bridge pipeline with critical content will be drawn up by the relevant operators by March 2018 and included in the operating instructions. In addition, the internal instructions for pipeline bridges will be revised by the end of 2017.In order to ensure that the relevant measuring station can be quickly identified in the event of leaks, the specialist unit for pipe bridges is to affix a colour mark every 50&nbsp;m on pipe bridges in the accessible area and label the pipe bridge supports with the pipeline bridge section number by June 2018.Operators are urged to mark the piping with the telephone number of the measuring station. The accuracy and legibility of these markings should be checked during regular inspections.In order to ensure that the pipe bridge data are up-to-date, they are to be imported into the computer system and maintained.\n\n\nAs the event took place in a place particularly affected by corrosion (salt discharge), the plant was examined for further hot spots.In these areas identified as particularly at risk, the firm\u2019s corrosion protection department will carry out comprehensive external checks of the pipes by June 2018. Any deficiencies found will be corrected accordingly.In order to avoid secondary corrosion, old systems that are no longer in use are to be dismantled. If a pipe is to be maintained for subsequent return to service, it is to be treated as an active pipe and must be maintained and marked accordingly.\n\n\nThe quality of corrosion protection will be improved.For example, the removal of rust during maintenance is no longer to be carried out by hand, but by sandblasting. In addition, a partner company is to give confirmation that repairs in critical areas have been carried out properly.The operating engineers have been asked to ensure that works commissioned comply with the plant standards for corrosion protection.In addition, shift staff carrying out inspections are being made aware of the issue of corrosion.\n\nThe Government of Upper Bavaria \u2013 Labour Inspectorate has also called for a \u2018shortening of inspection intervals for pipelines in \u201chot spot\u201d areas (i.e. areas identified as particularly at risk).\u2019\nThe lessons learned highlight the importance of operational monitoring procedures (in particular with regard to corrosion, maintenance, alarm management) and emergency planning procedures."

        "Accident Description": "Four (4) explosions and a tank fire occurred in a sugar factory after tests on the pumping system, in which 13 m3 of alcohol were pumped into an empty 1500 m3 tank, had been performed.This accident is classified at level 3 of the Accident Gravity Scale due to the loss of production amounting to more than 2m euros (2.000.000 euros).",
        "Causes of the accident": "On 3rd September 2001 at about 16:00 hrs, the personnel of the distillery carried out the cleaning operations and a test&nbsp; transfer of alcohol to the empty and degassed tank F10 having a capacity of 1500 m3. The personnel distributed 50 kg of potassium permanganate dust on the tank bottom and transferred by gravity approximately 13m3 of alcohol in the tank. The personnel left the storage facility after finishing this operation at about 16:35 hrs.At 16:42(t=0), the tank F10 containing 13 m3 of alcohol exploded projecting its roof&nbsp; more than 10 m up in the air. The tank-roof fell on the roof of tank F8 with a capacity of 1500 m3 (empty when the accident occurred). The retention basin of the two tanks, called basin B, and tank F10 were on fire.At 16:52 (t= +10 min) explosion of the empty tank MG11 with a capacity of 540 m3 occurred. The roof was projected some 30 m away onto a nearby limestone pile . The safety managers of the distillery were alerted by the first explosions and activated the fixed fire-fighting means from the extinguishing system pump house - the fire monitor of the alcohol storage installation was set to foam position,- the spray rings on top of the adjacent silos were activated in water position - the spray rings on top of the tanks of the alcohol storage installation could be set on demand to either water or&nbsp; foam, this operation could be performed from the distribution stations located near the tanksOn request of the Classified Installation Inspectorate (DRIRE), the company requested the French National Institute of Industrial Environment and Risks (INERIS) to investigate the accident causes. The results of the investigation found that the explosion of Tank F10 was caused by the ignition of an explosive atmosphere (ATEX - ATmosph\u00e8re EXplosive) consisting of a mixture of alcohol vapours and air which had formed under the tank roof.The ignition was caused by a strongly exothermic reaction of an excess&nbsp; amount of potassium permanganate (KMNO4) reacting with a 96% hydro-alcoholic solution of ethanol. The domino effect increased the consequences of the accident damaging other tanks.The&nbsp; report is based specifically on the results of a laboratory test which showed that a heterogeneous mixture of KMNO4 and ethanol in the proportions present in the tank causes an exothermic reaction capable of igniting an explosive atmosphere above the surface formed by ethanol/air. Mixing permanganate with ethanol was a procedure, which had been adopted since the storage installation was put into service in 1980 without causing any significant incident, in order to reduce the content of sulphur compounds in the alcohol.",
        "Consequences": "Loss of production damage is estimated at 2.13 m euros, material damage is estimated at 2m euros (2.000.000 euros): 2 tanks were completely destroyed - 15000 m3 tank the structure collapsed;- 540 m3 tank - (roof projected)- the roofs of three (3) 115 m3 tanks were ripped open.The company will treat 2000 m3 of extinguishing water.",
        "Emergency response": "At 17:00 h the Onsite Emergency Plan was releasedAt 17:15 h 120 employees and 90 fire fighters were mobilised, emulsifiers (some proved to be incompatible with alcohol) were provided also by neighbouring industries.At 17:38 h spray rings and a water monitor were used to protect nearby installations. At 17:42 h the fire was extinguishedAt 18:55 h spraying was interruptedAt 19:30 h the On-site Emergency Plan was called off",
        "Lesson Learned": "The installation was compliant with the provisions defined in the ministerial technical guidelines of 9th November 1989; the provisions were implemented in 1994 and concerned the protection systems (fire extinguishing system, fixed water/foam monitor, emulsifier reserve) this allowed a rapid response of the factory personnel while the external emergency services&nbsp; were arriving-An on-site Emergency Response Exercise performed in June of the same year based on&nbsp; a similar accident scenario allowed the personnel to react in the correct way to the crisis situation.The question arises about what would have happened if the personnel had been absent from the site, a situation which actually occurs between two sugar production seasons.The emulsifiers supplied by nearby industries proved to be incompatible with polarised flammable liquids (alcohol) and could not be used on the premises of the sugar factory.The communication system with the fire brigade failed, as it had done during the emergency response exercise of 28th June 2001."

        "Causes of the accident": "The cause was a HCl cloud emitted by the neighbouring company\nKerr-McGee. This cloud was caused by an operator error and a leaking\nautomatic valve. The operator had to close a hand valve as\nblock-safety, which he forgot, or he didn't understand this order.\nBecause of these two omissions TiCl4 was able to leak to a cyclone\nvessel, which contents eventually dropped into a sump vessel filled\nwith water. This caused an immediate reaction which formed HCl. The\namount formed was too large for the scrubber system, therefore this\ncloud of HCl went directly out the stack. Because the wind direction\nwas west and weather conditions were foggy, the cloud remained rather\ncompact while floating over de AVR site. At several places on the AVR\nsite people saw the cloud and smelled the HCl scent.",

        "Accident Description": "During the night of 6-7 March 2012, a fire in an industrial park, which broke out on the roof of a nitrile-amine plant, led to contamination of the river Alz by the company operating the site. Course of events at nitrile-amine plant:\nA connecting pipe between the filtration unit and fume scrubber, which is intended to relieve the pressure in an empty filtration unit, caused a liquid reaction mixture to enter the fume scrubber. The majority of the reaction mixture which entered the scrubber flowed into the waste water sewer via the overflow in the scrubber and could be contained by the grease trap of the nitrile-amine plant (approximately 4 700 kg). Approximately 1 000 kg* of the reaction mixture went through a vent stack to the roof of the nitrile-amine plant where it caught fire (most likely spontaneous ignition due to copper (Cu) catalyst it contained). During the subsequent firefighting operation, much of the water used to extinguish the fire entered the cooling water and rainwater sewers via the roof drainage. This water was channelled along the sewer into a retention basin of the central water reservoir. Approximately 8 kg of the reaction mixture was discharged into the Alz before the valve to the retention basin was completely closed. After the firefighting operation was complete, approximately 100 kg of additional reaction mixture which had contaminated the sewers was discharged over the course of 9 hours through the cooling water outlet into the Alz. Fish kill was caused along a 14 km stretch of the Alz. Three members of the fire brigade were hurt during the firefighting operation or suffered burns during the subsequent clean-up operation and received outpatient treatment.\nThe member of staff from the nitrile-amine plant who discovered the fire was taken to hospital for precautionary reasons and placed under observation overnight. *The 1 000 kg (approx.) of product/copper catalyst mixture was discharged as follows:\n- Approximately 200 kg was contained in the retention basin,\n- Approximately 108 kg was discharged into water which entered the Alz,\n- The remainder (approximately 692 kg) either combusted or was also discharged into the Alz.",
        "Causes of the accident": "System error / construction\nAt 18:53 on 6 March 2012 a \u2018cloudy run\u2019 was started in sector X, i.e. raw amine is pumped around in a circuit from the infeed through the filter until the product is clear and the next production stage (\u2018clear run\u2019) can begin. At 19:19 a ball valve between the filter and the central scrubber opens. This ball valve is only needed for the \u2018cake discharge\u2019 function and may not be opened in normal operation. The \u2018cake discharge\u2019 function is only performed two to three times a year to clean the filter. The production stages in the nitrile-amine plant are controlled automatically in the control room via a process control system (PCS) in \u2018step sequences\u2019. Since the ball valve is designed as a closing valve, its basic or safety position is \u2018OPEN\u2019 (zero position). At the end of the step sequence \u2018cake discharge\u2019 the ball valve is closed again. This position \u2018CLOSED\u2019 is maintained by the PCS until the valve is activated again.\nIn September 2011 the PCS was converted to a new program which became operational in October 2011. Between the start-up of the new PCS and the incident on 6 March 2012 the \u2018cake discharge\u2019 step sequence was not activated. As a result of the conversion of the PCS the background information for the ball valve (\u2018CLOSED\u2019) was lost. The result was that, in automatic mode, the ball valve switched to its basic position \u2018OPEN\u2019. When the step sequence \u2018cloudy run\u2019 is started the PCS checks, among other things, whether the ball valve is closed. Therefore, in order to close the ball valve, when the new PCS started up the operating mode was switched from \u2018Automatic\u2019 to \u2018Manual\u2019. At the above-mentioned time the operating mode overview which the operator can call up indicated that the ball valve status was \u2018NOMINAL = A (AUTOMATIC), ACTUAL = M (MANUAL)\u2019. Instead of a green button as in automatic mode, the operating mode overview showed a red button with the message \u2018OK\u2019.\nAlthough the step sequence \u2018cloudy run\u2019 had been running without problem since 18:53, the operator switched the ball valve to Automatic and thus opened it. There was no safety check or locking of the ball valve in normal production operation.\nAfter the ball valve opened the control room received various messages about rising pH levels and increasing pressure and temperature.\nWhen the ball valve opened the pressure in the filter fell spontaneously to approx. 1.5 bar. At this pressure level the pressure at the filter in the waste gas scrubber also fell. The substance mixture entered the scrubber infeed (volume 2.5 m\u00b3) and filled it.\nThe scrubber infeed is open to the atmosphere, i.e. not under pressure. As a result of the pressure in the filter the scrubber infeed and the attached vent stack were completely filled in the period 19:19 to 19:38. At 19:38 product overflowed from the stack (23.5 m high) onto the roof of the building and then at 19:43 the product mixture ignited. It must be assumed that the substance mixture discharged through the stack (approx. 1 000 kg, part of which burned off) also ran off the tin roof of the plant to the building annexed (gutter, downpipe) and onto the lower-lying flat roof, as the mixture of firefighting water and substances subsequently did during the plant fire service deployment. From there it ran through the rainwater drain pipe into the cooling water and rainwater sewer (InfraServ Gendorf sector).\nThe scrubber infeed has a free overflow into the grease trap. Some of the approx. 4.7 t of the substance mixture ran out of the scrubber infeed through the plant waste water system to the grease trap and was contained there. The grease trap was sealed off at 20:02, so that from that time onwards no more plant waste water entered the central waste water cleaning installation. According to the operating instructions dated 4 November 2011, if product enters the manufacturing waste water sewer the grease trap must be closed immediately. Therefore the substance mixture had already been discharged through this drain before the fluid level in the scrubber had risen so far that the substance mixture could escape through the stack. Even during discharge through the stack, substance mixture continued to flow in the direction of the grease trap along the path described.\nThe substance mixture and the contaminated firefighting water entered the Alz via the cooling water and rainwater sewer. This led to major fish kill and damage to other life in the lower Alz along a stretch of almost 15 kilometres.",
        "Consequences": "Material damage to plant and building. Fish kill along 14 km stretch",
        "Emergency response": "Once the environmental impact had become apparent (fish kill in the Alz), all sewer systems in the central water reservoir were immediately diverted. - Plant fire service alerted (7.43 p.m.)\n- Presence of all colleagues checked\n- Plant emergency shut-down procedure activated (7.44 p.m.)\n- Containment of water used to extinguish fire in central water reservoir from 7.56 p.m.\n- Containment of contaminated cooling water from 9.21 a.m. on Wednesday 7 March 2012 Clean-up and repair work Environmental damage: measures agreed in consultation with authorities and fisheries experts.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The points listed below represent the recommendations made in accordance with \u00a7 19(3), subparagraph 3, St\u00f6rfallV (Hazardous Incident Regulation). For clarity, the individual measures are briefly outlined as follows. 1. Segregation of the cooling water and rainwater sewer from roof areas which can be polluted by hazardous substances in the event of a malfunction.\nThe rainwater system of the roof areas of the building affected by the fire no longer drains into the cooling water and rainwater sewer but, by agreement with the water management office, is connected to the plant sewer system.\nSimilar measures for other areas of the industrial park will require a master plan approved by the authorities. 2. Monitoring of the TOC (total organic carbon) level in the cooling water and rainwater sewers.\nFor technical reasons the readings from TOC monitoring in the South section of the cooling water and rainwater sewer are displayed after a time lag of approx. five minutes. This time lag is now offset by having the lower valve located directly ahead of the discharge point into the Alz close at the same time as the upper valve when TOC monitoring gives the signal. Thus, given the flow speed of the water, there is sufficient time to contain any polluted water which has already passed the upper valve by closing the lower valve.\nThe readings from TOC monitoring in the East section of the cooling water and rainwater sewer are also displayed after a time lag of approx. five minutes for technical reasons. It is currently being examined whether additional TOC monitoring can be installed at a point upstream in the system. 3. All-clear for contaminated sewers given by the plant fire service only after analyses have been carried out.\nTo prevent any product residues from being washed into the Alz together with cooling water following firefighting operations, where sewers have been loaded with substances toxic to fish or generally hazardous to the environment, in future they will not be given the all-clear until analysis has shown that no products are present. 4. More specific operating instructions and training of staff in the wastewater treatment plant.\nThe technical and organisational measures taken will be set out in more precisely worded operating instructions for the staff in the wastewater treatment plant. The staff will receive training and instruction twice per year. At the most recent training session it was again pointed out what measures must be taken when certain limit values are reached and in what sequence the valves must be activated in hazardous situations. 5. Shortening the closing time of valves in the cooling water and rainwater sewer.\nThe stretch of sewer which is closed off by the upper valve has a diameter of 1.2 m.\nAt normal water levels only approx. 10 to 15 % of that diameter are needed. The basic position of the valve is now set such that only the diameter actually needed is open. This shortens the closing time of the valve. 6. Review of firefighting water retention system.\nThe plant\u2019s local firefighting water retention system was checked in accordance with the applicable regulations.\nThe central water retention system is state-of-the-art. It was found to meet the requirements of the applicable regulations in full.\nNevertheless further investigations are currently being carried out to technically optimise the installation, in particular as regards substances which are insoluble and lighter than water. 7. Isolating cooling water from products hazardous to the environment.\nIn the plant all points at which substances with a fish toxicity of ? 0.1 mg/l are cooled by water are being converted to isolated (primary/secondary circuit) or circulation cooling. 8. Review of all safety equipment in the plant.\nAll plants in the industrial park will undergo a renewed check and assessment on the basis of the inventory of substances present. The existing safety measures will be reviewed on the basis of the results obtained. If necessary further measures will be laid down. 9. Re-examination of other measuring and monitoring methods.\nIt is being investigated whether cutting-edge metrology exists with which the sampling of flowing cooling water at varying water levels can be improved even further."

Wind light, North Westerly.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A fire broke out on June 21 in the oxidising materials section of the Production Store building. The fire spread rapidly and violently, involving within minutes an external drum storage area where flammable liquids were stored. The fire took considerable resources and time to extinguish. During fire, two explosions occurred in the warehouse. Off-site damages were significant and a large number of residents were evacuated from their houses. Fears that large scale pollution of the environment would occur did not realise. No casualties occurred. Five firefighters attended hospital for minor treatment and a number of members of the public required attention following mishaps during the evacuation.More detailed information about the accident are shown on the Original Report together with three maps showing the surrounding area and the extent of the effects.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:Fire started in oxidising materials store when it was unoccupied, and spread to other parts of warehouse and outside drum storage compound.CAUSES:The Health and Safety Executive's investigation has not established the precise cause of the fire, but several valid hypotheses (such as the possible leakage of strongly corrosive substances onto organic materials, exothermic decomposition of stored materials and, less likely because it would have required two simultaneous failures, the mixing together of incompatible materials from spills or leaks) have been suggested. The rapidity of spread of the fire was due to a breakdown in good chemical warehousing practices in the factory which led to materials which were incompatible in a fire being stored together. Many of these materials were present as part of a procedure established by the company to ensure that chemicals that were surplus or off-specification to their own or their customer's requirements were disposed of in a satisfactory manner.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:5 firefighters attended hospital for minor treatment but they were not hospitalized. Outside the establishment, 3,000 people were evacuated. No one was injured but a number of people required attention, following mishaps during evacuation.MATERIAL LOSS:The chemical store was destroyed and the stored raw materials and finished products were lost. The cost of the material losses has been estimated in about 3.67 M Euros. Outside the establishment the adjacent public house were damaged by fire. Minor off-site missiles damages and widespread damages to glazing on buildings within about 100 m of the site.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The NorthWest wind caused smoke and fume to drifted towards the a small town.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Automatic fire alarm operated and the fire brigade intervened. Staff on-site was evacuated.&nbsp; A total of 19 pumps, 2 turntable ladders, 1 hydraulic platform, a foam tender, a breathing apparatus tender and control unit were involved, and up to 22 BA sets were in use at any one time, with over 140 individual wearings of sets. Firewater runoff retained almost entirely in on-site effluent treatment plant. EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Progressive implementation of pre-existing local emergency plan with precautionary evacuation of 3,000 local residents who might have been at risk from toxic components of smoke plume. The site was not subjected to the more stringent requirements arising under article 5 of Directive EEC/501/82 but the storage of petroleum spirit under license would be known to the emergency services and routine familiarization visits and logs of data held by them would in the circumstances provide a ready guide to the task that faced them. In that way, the generic \"all-hazard\" emergency off-site plans at County and District Government levels were brought into play and the smoothness of the precautionary evacuation bears tribute to the systems of emergency planning that was in place.No emergency measures are stille required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Bulk chemical storage at the site has been discontinued. A series of notices under the \nHealth and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 have been served to ensure that the company reviews its procedures for storage and disposal of chemicals, and that revised procedures and standards are adopted and followed if the store is rebuilt on this or other sites.Measures to mitigate consequences: Off-site clear-up was initiated and completed within a few weeks by staff of firm and specialist fire-fighting/clear-up team from firm's parent company. Off-site property damages have been repaired."

        "Finish Date": "2010-06-10 15:52:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident took place during hot work on the supply line to Tank TKX which contained spent stripped fermentation broth (SFB) from the production of antibiotics. This work was being carried out by a subcontract firm as part of a temporary modification to the wastewater treatment unit. There was a confined explosion of gas inside the tank which led to the roof of the tank being projected approximately 20 metres; the explosion killed one subcontractor and injured four other workers (three subcontractors and one company employee), all of whom were working on the modification. The SFB supply line had been emptied of wastewater coming from the distillery unit. The air vent of the tank, located on the roof of the tank, had been open as usual. The tank was approximately 50% full. Five workers were carrying out the work, four from the external firm and one from the company itself. The external workers had disconnected the SFB line by removing the shut-off valve on the entry duct on the roof of Tank TKX without closing it with the port's blind flange. One worker was standing on the roof of the tank near the open flange; the others were on the walkway giving access to the roof of the tank. They were beginning to cut the existing tube using a disc saw; sparks most likely produced by contact between the disc and the tubing ignited the explosive atmosphere which, unknown to them, had collected inside the tank. There was a confined vapour explosion (CVE) inside the tank which projected the tank roof approximately 20 metres. The shock wave threw the worker standing on the roof onto that of the adjacent tank, killing him; pieces of the tank roof fell onto the other four workers standing on the walkway; the connected tubing was also thrown a great distance.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The direct cause of the accident was the presence of a mixture of highly inflammable gases inside the TKX tank, ignited by sparks caused by a cutting disc during temporary modification work. The gas came from the sediment at the bottom of the tank. The conditions inside the tank, i.e. the lack of oxygen, encouraged the formation of populations of anaerobic bacteria which initiated fermentation, thereby producing various highly inflammable gaseous compounds, such as hydrogen and methane, which are lighter than air. In addition, the presence of sulphates means that a series of other (sulphide) gases may be produced which are extremely inflammable and much heavier than air. A vent was present on the tank roof; this allowed only the circulation of the lighter-than-air gases. The anaerobic conditions which led to the formation of the gases were due to a modification to the tank undertaken around ten years previously; this closed the air vents on the tank base which were included in the original plans. During operations the sediment would accumulate on the base of the tank in large quantities and under anaerobic conditions. The area had been considered to be non-dangerous within the meaning of the ATEX Directive. The work had been decided on in order to carry out a temporary modification without, however, adequately assessing the risks. The internal hot work safety procedure (isolation, clean-up, use of an explosimeter) was not applied. The fact that the work was carried out when the tank was full meant that the ignition of inflammable gases was inevitable. Various estimates have been made regarding the exact chemical breakdown of the gas inside the tank, but analyses and laboratory simulations seem to confirm that sulphide gases in layers lower down the tank were the main components, along with hydrogen and methane from layers higher up the tank.",
        "Consequences": "In human terms, the tank explosion caused the immediate death of a subcontract worker and injured four others (three subcontract workers and one company employee). The worker who died was standing on the tank roof holding the flanged end of the SFB supply line which was to be cut. The explosion took place as soon as the disc saw touched the pipe. The roof was torn off along the welding line and thrown into the air; after flying over the adjacent tank TKZ it fell to earth around 20 metres away. The worker was thrown from the roof of the tank onto that of tank TKZ, where his body was found. He had probably landed on his back, thereby hitting the back of his head against one of the roof's reinforcing beams (double-t iron beams arranged in a radial pattern on the roof). The four injured workers, who suffered first- and second-degree burns on various parts of the body, were thrown off the TKX walkway onto the nearby TKY tank and fell down the exit ladder; all were given first aid by the company medical service and then taken to Brindisi hospital where they were treated, with expected recovery times ranging from 40 to 200 days. The material damage has been estimated at EUR 1.8 million for equipment and production losses, and EUR 0.8 million to restore the area to use, a total of EUR 2.6 million.",
        "Emergency response": "The accident occurred at around 12 noon. The internal emergency procedures were activated within ten minutes. As there was no fire, some members of the emergency team treated the injured and transferred them to Brindisi hospital in the company ambulance. Other team members searched for the fourth worker who was carrying out the hot work; he was found dead. The pumps to the TKX tank were closed and the unit put in safety mode. A fire brigade team called to the site by people outside the plant arrived 15 minutes after the accident and carried out emergency operations. Half an hour after the accident the emergency medical services arrived, having been called in by the company employees. The medical services confirmed the death of the fourth subcontract worker. Three ambulances were present at the accident site. The fire brigade's special CBRN team also arrived half an hour after the accident in order to check for the possible presence of explosive atmospheres. The emergency was closed within approximately four hours when the emergency services returned to base.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The lack of aeration at the base of the equalisation tanks leads to anaerobic fermentation of accumulated residues with the production of various highly inflammable gases. Highly explosive mixtures can ignite at the slightest opportunity, particularly if hot work is carried out without taking the necessary precautions. Aeration of the tank base is vital for safety reasons and must not be done away with for any reason.\nIn the ATEX Directive (96/92/EC) plants with tanks containing spent broths are classified as being at risk of the creation of explosive atmospheres, and ATEX and safety procedures must therefore be used.\nFor modifications, even temporary ones, the risks must be analysed using appropriate methods, such as HAZOP. The risks of such work must also be analysed.\nEmployees and workers from subcontract firms must be informed about and trained in safety procedures, and more importantly the unit heads must have a culture of safety, i.e. the strict application of safety procedures.\nAccidents of this kind may happen in future, also due to the expansion of biotechnology in different sectors. While many biotechnologies are malodorous, this unpleasant aspect cannot be eliminated at the cost of creating much more serious risks, as in this case.\n"

Operators closed the tank and bund drain valves preventing loss to the surrounding environment. The supervisor observed that there was a v-shaped dip in the edge of the floating roof from which gasoline was leaking on to the roof through the damaged rim seal and contacted the emergency response team.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Damaged rim seal. A v-shaped dip in the edge of the floating roof, allowed loss of hydrocarbon mixed with rainwater down drain line.",
        "Consequences": "Hydrocarbon mixed with rainwater was released into the annular ring drain around the bottom of the tank and bund. THis was recovered. There were significant unignited evaporative losses to atmosphere.",
        "Emergency response": "Initially the on site emergency response team applied foam via the fixed rim seal pourers and deployed foam cannons on the surface of the tank. An exclusion zone was set up to prevent ignition of the flammable vapour from the surface of the tank and exposure to toxic substances in naptha. However, foam application was stopped due to concerns about it causing static ignition. The Incident Management Team decided that the safest option to prevent fire was to remove gasoline by displacement with water through the roof drain to another tank. In all 1349 tonnes were recovered without injury to persons on site and contaminated water and hydrocarbon is being treated prior to disposal. Allowing the foam blanket to disperse resulted in significant evaporative losses to atmosphere of 4564 tonnes. This is in excess of the reportable quantity of 5% of the top tier threshold for gasolines and naphthas of 25000 tonnes namely 1250 tonnes (COMAH Schedule 1 Part 2).",
        "Lesson Learned": "The company considered the design code of t453 and the specific gravity of product < 0.6, they identified other tanks under similar duty. Prioir to failure they had exceptionally high localised rain fall (42mm) and considered the design of the roof drains in relation to removing water from the roof.\u00a0 the drain ran diagonally from the roof to the bottom of the tank they looked at how the weight of water filling the drain could potentially drag the roof down,\u00a0 they found no evidence to support this hypothesis. They discussed the dismantling of the tank, considering the roof was deformed and their concerns re: unzipping of the tank - Petroineos contracted Das Fleet (a dutch demolition company with experience of this type of work) Outcomes of their inspection of the damaged tank were that it was likely a combination of multiple causes all contributing to the partial collapse of the roof: Likely Scenarios: Crease in roof was 1m in depth24hrs prior to failure 42mm of rain fell they considered drain restriction as above - however when tested the non return drain valve was functioning as designed. no obvious damage to roof drain, at time of incident the roof drain was free running, Drain size for the service was also considered -\u00a0Petroineos stated that there was no reason to assume the drain was inadequately sized. Roof drain design: roof drain runs inside of tank as the tank roof lists the angle of the drain pipe is changed leading to the drain being compromised and unable to drainwater from the roof effectively potentially leading to rainwater/product building up on roof increasing the roof loading and potentially contributing to the roof sinking through loss of bouancy.Petroineos stated that there was no evidence for this under normal operation. Build up of product?No evidence of the roof material being penetrated. the roof was designed and manufactured by Motherwell Bridge circa 1960s to the standard in force at that time. All future refurb will be taken in line with current standards. Tank 453 was originally on Benzine duty (sg:0.6)\u00a0 the tank functioned as designed on this service for 30-40 years without incident. Petroineos\u00a0considered other tanks on their site under similar duty (1950s/60s design originally on higher s.g product then changing to lower s.g product) no issues on any other tank were found. No product placed in the tank was above normal operating temperatures, (stabalised gasoline is lighter and flashes off vapour at a higher rate when heated) There was no evidence of this. Roof Distorted/Tipped? Vapour lock? can't be ruled out, but no evidence to support this.

        "Accident Description": "Description of the warehouse:The incident happened in a prototyping storage room. The storage room takes up half of a building, with the other half being used for prototype construction. The front of the storage room consisted of double steel doors with large glass window panes. The back of the room consisted of glass bricks on the upper third. The other walls were solid walls with no windows.\nThere were steel cabinets along one wall, the first of which, nearest the door, was used as a chemical cabinet with forced ventilation for the storage of small quantities of e.g. solvent-based cleaning agents, adhesives and other auxiliaries. There were open steel shelves opposite the cabinets.\nNo explosives were stored in the room in accordance with the operating instructions. It was only used for material storage during the working day.\nDescription of the incident:At 4.00 a.m. on 22 August 2012 popping noises were heard coming from a building (storage room and prototype construction) by a guard.\nWhen he approached the building, he saw flames flaring out of a window. At the time, there were no other persons in the area of the warehouse.\nThe fire brigade was called and extinguished the fire. Local residents were also advised to keep windows closed.\nThe next day it became apparent that the fire had started in a chemical cabinet in the storage room. Signs of deflagration could also be identified, as all of the cabinet doors were open in one direction due to the pull of the flame front.\nResistant walls prevented the fire spreading to other parts of the building.\nExternal helpers were requested in accordance with the emergency plan.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause of the fire cannot be conclusively determined. The expert on causes of fire confirmed in his report that the hazardous substance cabinet on the left side of the building was the place where the fire/explosion started. The burn marks indicate that the hazardous substances had ignited and burned through in the cabinet in which they were stored, eventually causing the cabinet and then the doors of the building to open under pressure.\nIt could also not be ruled out that the fire had been caused by a technical defect in a fan motor on the cabinet due to the severe damage to the fan.\nThe examination of the safety cabinet showed that it met the requirements of Technical Rule for Hazardous Substances (TRGS) 510. The cabinet should have been checked by the manufacturer in March 2012. A check would not have prevented the fire from starting. Other cabinets of the same design which were inspected on site had no apparent faults. In principle, the cabinet used was suitable for storing the chemicals employed.",

        "Emergency response": "- Safety measures according to fire brigade and internal emergency plan;- Fire watch.&nbsp;\nAs a precaution, the water used to extinguish the fire, which had accumulated in the drains and dry wells, was collected in IBC containers for disposal.Measurements carried out by an institute showed no contamination of the water.",
        "Lesson Learned": "- In-house instructions on the storage of hazardous substances have been revised.- The storage recommendations made in the fire investigation were included.- Staff will be trained.- Emergency management is being continuously practised and improved.&nbsp;\nLessons learned from the incident:Since it is possible the fire was caused by an exothermic chemical reaction of substances as a result of external contamination and the substances dripping from the stored containers, the operator took action to store hazardous materials in hazardous substance cabinets. The operating instructions for hazardous substance cabinets have been revised.\nThe main points are:- Contaminated containers must not be used;- Solvents/chemicals must be stored only in tightly sealed containers;- Ventilation grills on the hazardous substance cabinets must not be blocked;- Use drip trays made of non-combustible material under containers;- Packaging (cardboard, film) must not be stored in the hazardous substance cabinet as they constitute fire loads;- Monthly operational testing of extraction inside the cabinets.&nbsp;\nLessons from the incident:Hazardous substance cabinets are usually designed to prevent fire from entering from the outside.The potential dangers from a fire started inside the cabinet are often overlooked in hazardous substance and risk assessments."

        "Accident Title": "Side collision between tank wagons at a refinery loading yard",
        "Start Date": "2021-10-26 06:15:00",
        "Finish Date": "2021-10-26 22:20:00",
        "Accident Description": "On 26&nbsp;October 2021 a collision occurred during shunting operations on adjacent tracks (17 and 18) in a loading yard.A tank wagon filled with petrol tipped over and ended up on its side on an adjacent track. No spillage occurred and no one was injured.\nThe incident took place at around 06:15&nbsp;hrs, shortly after the handover between the night shift and the early shift. It was still dark and slightly foggy at the time of the incident; however, the loading and track areas involved were illuminated, and visibility was good.\nAll loading and shunting operations in this part of the facility are performed independently by a service provider. Tracks 17 and 18 together form a single work station, loading yard (A), supervised by a responsible worker.\nTrain convoys, each consisting of 10 tank wagons, are usually deployed in loading yard (A) on tracks 17 and 18 respectively. The tank wagons are then filled simultaneously on both tracks.A conveyor system (\u2018troller\u2019) moves the tank wagons around the loading berths.\nIn normal operations, after the first three tank wagons (wagons 1 to 3) on each track have been filled, the filling of a fourth tank wagon begins. Additionally, the front tank wagons already filled (wagons 1 to 3) are uncoupled from the rest of the convoy (wagons 4 to 10) and a shunting locomotive moves them in the direction of the crossover (A). The \u2018troller\u2019 conveyor system remains positioned north of tank wagon No&nbsp;4 as it is filled and holds the remaining tank wagons in place. The shunting locomotive moves the first three tank wagons (Nos&nbsp;1 to 3) in the direction of the crossover (A) and the wagons are halted at a specified stopping point shortly before they reach the crossover.They are held there and thus serve as the point of contact for the tank wagons which follow later. After filling has ended, the remaining tank wagons are uncoupled from those still empty and released by the conveyor system. The slight gradient in the track area then ensures that they move independently without any crew in the direction of the \u2018southern crossover\u2019. Upon reaching the stopping point, they come to a halt against the convoy consisting of tank wagons 1 to 3. As they move south, the speed of the tank wagons is no greater than walking pace.After all the tank wagons have been filled and released in a southerly direction, the two convoys now on tracks 17 and 18 ahead of the crossover (A) are combined into a full train load and checked by an inspector before exiting the site through the rail gate.\nOn the day of the incident, shortened train convoys, each consisting of just 5&nbsp;tank wagons, were berthed for filling on tracks 17 and 18. This configuration is exceptional and happens only once or twice a year.\nAccording to earlier findings, in the course of the incident on 26&nbsp;October 2021 no shunting locomotive was requested by the loaders to shunt the two filled convoys consisting of tank wagons 1 to 3. Instead, the two convoys consisting of wagons 1 to 3 were moved along tracks 17 and 18 in quick succession using the \u2018troller\u2019 conveyor system. As a result, the two released convoys began to move down the track almost simultaneously until there was contact between the sides of the two convoys approaching the crossover (A) and one of the tank wagons tipped over.\nSafety measures:Shunting staff saw what had happened, alerted the emergency services and initiated the rescue chain.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Root causes:\n\nLack of communication and flawed, incomplete shift handover.\nLessons from previous incidents as regards shortcomings in the safety culture, leadership and shift handover were not implemented quickly enough or consistently.\nLack of communication and documentation during the shift handover, accentuated by inadequate guidelines and structure in the organisation of the shift handover process.\nUnclear and insufficient definition of interfaces and responsibilities between rail service provider and refinery operator.\nInsufficient lessons from incidents, in communication with lack of consistency and/or follow-up in implementing defined areas for improvement.\nNo other technical and/or organisational barriers to slow the tank wagons once released.\n\nHuman causes:\n\nShortcomings in the shift management.\nThese shortcomings resulted in inappropriate criticism with the result that the person filling the tank wagons subsequently was \u2018not paying attention\u2019.\n\nThe person filling the tank wagons lacked workplace risk awareness:\n\nLack of process planning: no review at shift handover with the person filling the tank wagons in the loading yard. No other action taken to obtain an overview of the situation in the loading yard.\nInadequate work execution: no check (visual RID* check list) at the critical uncoupling stage to ensure that a brake unit was correctly positioned.\n\n*RID = Regulation concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail.",
        "Consequences": "Damaged tank wagons and salvage costs.",
        "Emergency response": "Rail operations at the affected loading berths were temporarily suspended. Emergency response by the site\u2019s own fire service. Support/advice via an on-site \u2018transport accident information and assistance system\u2019 (Transport-Unfall-Informations- und Hilfeleistungssystem - TUIS) technical adviser.\nUse of a recovery train.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Emergency actions developed and implemented in cooperation between operator and service provider, including:\n\nA rail operations \u2018safety scout\u2019, i.e. an experienced worker from the operator, to check and advise on site, across shifts.\nAdditional service provider support needed on loading yard tracks 17/18 by the service provider\u2019s shift supervisor, particularly at the beginning of shifts.\nSafety devices (e.g. stop blocks) to stop tank wagons rolling away once they have been halted on track 17/18 and on track 13 to be placed at the appropriate southerly point to prevent runaway tank wagons.\n\nOther actions:\n\nDescription and assessment of operator/service provider interfaces to identify potential managerial and communications improvements.\nConsistent involvement of the service provider. Based on the interfaces found, develop points of focus and adapt stakeholder tasks at operator/service provider interfaces. In the process, monitor common operating points.\nAlignment of instructions. On the aforementioned basis, supplement, update and harmonise instructions.\nReview and optimise the shift handover. Clearly structure and define the content and process at shift handover with the service provider and also describe the process in the form of written instructions.\nAdapt the job description for the shift manager.\nReview and optimise the training process. Based on the review, adapt training so that its content and methodology are appropriate to the target groups. Here, risks and risk awareness during shunting and filling should provide the focal point.\nDeploy technical safety actions to prevent runaway tank wagons (in this instance, a tank wagon brake on the track).\n\nAs described, the causes were multi-layered, inter alia the link between the incident and the shift handover. It is important at shift handover for there to be comprehensive communication about the tasks and conditions found on site at that specific moment. Appropriate standards should be established to this end and documentation produced accordingly.\nRule violations are another aspect of the incident. In routine activities, it is common for sequential short cuts or negligence to occur (wittingly or unwittingly); if undetected or without repercussions (in terms of either detecting an issue or sanctioning it), they take root and go unrectified. It is important therefore when monitoring the safety management system to ensure compliance with safety regulations and to take prompt corrective action if shortcomings are identified. Academic literature refers to a \u2018drift to danger\u2019 (Rasmussen, 1997) or to a \u2018normalisation of deviance\u2019 (Vaughan, 1996). The \u2018drift to danger\u2019 caused by external pressures or the acceptance of \u2018deviances\u2019 because they have not resulted in \u2018disasters\u2019 are a major challenge for complex organisations, in particular those dealing with hazardous substances and processes. A robust, mature safety culture can counter this by establishing unequivocal values which are exemplified by management and by promoting open communication in all directions.\nThe fact that a service provider\u2019s actions caused the incident shows that interfaces between operator, service provider and monitoring are particularly important for allowing the service provider to take the appropriate safety action."

Release exceeds 5% of qualifying inventory for Ethylene Oxide.An Ethylene Oxide tanker was being loaded at the bulk Ethylene Oxide storage tanks. This was a routine operation with approximately 24 tankers loaded that same day. Sieger gas detector in bund alarmed plus high level alarm to knock out pot located in the bund - both alarms and DCS panel in nearby control room. Ethylene Oxide was discovered overflowing from the knock out pot to the bund central drain gulley. The tanker loading meanwhile stopped (trip system) due to metered amount (18 tonnes) through system. It was found on weighing the tanker that the load was 4 tonnes less than expected.The release was caused by a spring operated hand valve not closing and allowing a path from the nitrogen vent line on the loading pipework to the knock out pot. The pot was not designed to take large quantities of liquid and hence overflowed to bund. The release was contained in the bund and disposed of by controlled dilution with water to the main site drains. There were no injuries and no ignition of the release which was contained within the central gully of the bund (reduced surface area for pool) and was refrigerated material.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The failure of a hand operated valve allowed a route for Ethylene Oxide to enter the vent system. The Knock out pot was not designed to handle large amounts of liquid and hence overflowed.\nN.B The vent system is a safety feature to allow depressurisation of flexible hoses after transfer.

        "Consequences": "A slick measuring 5&nbsp;km long and 500&nbsp;m wide was found in the &Eacute;tang de Berre lagoon and in the Marseille-Rh&ocirc;ne canal and oily deposits could be seen over a 1 km stretch of Ja&iuml; beach. Birds coated in hydrocarbons were found.",
        "Emergency response": "The relevant section of the canal is permanently protected by three booms. These booms allowed most of the oily water that had overflowed from the tank to be contained. The emergency services and refinery employees put in place additional sorbent booms and steered vessels through the slick so as to disperse it.\nJa\u00ef beach was closed and 40 people (refinery employees and subcontractors) cleaned up the shore. Over the following days (up until 13 November), the hydrocarbons were pumped and the booms were enlarged (up to 5,000&nbsp;m) and new ones laid. The clean-up operations lasted 15 days.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The containment capacity was insufficient and had not factored in the exceptional rainfall levels."

        "Accident Title": "Blast furnace explosion caused by over-pressurisation of the furnace due to the interaction of water and hot molten materials",
        "Start Date": "2001-11-08 17:13:00",
        "Finish Date": "2001-11-09 09:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "A blast furnace exploded&nbsp;at approximately 17.13 hours on 8 November 2001. The accident event began with a rapid over-pressurisation of the furnace contents in the bosh area due to the interaction of water and hot molten materials. The immediate effect of this furnace over-pressure was to lift that part of the structure above the lap joint upwards, the furnace lintel rising up off the column heads normally supporting the furnace. It is estimated that the structure above the lap joint rose by some 0.75 m. This structure, with its associated burden, was estimated to weigh around 5000 tonnes. The lifting of the upper part of the furnace left an opening of approximately 400-600 mm around the entire circumference at lap joint level. Gases and hot materials were ejected horizontally from this opening. During the period that this gap remained open, some 200 tonnes of liquid, solid, and semi-solid material were ejected onto the cast house floor. Gaseous material and dust rose into the cast house, exited through various openings in the building and into the atmosphere, where much of it ignited. A cloud of ignited dust and gaseous material was thrown several hundred feet into the air above the furnace. The furnace-top \u2018bleeder\u2019 valves also opened and discharged into the atmosphere. Gases from these valves also ignited.The furnace then fell back down vertically as the pressure decreased. During the explosion it had twisted (anticlockwise) through approximately 20\u201350 mm and moved a distance off-centre of about 100 mm, leaving it supported on the lower lap joint plate, with the lintel mounting positions no longer in contact with the column top flanges but instead some 50\u2013100 mm above the column tops. This meant that the weight of the furnace stack was resting, eccentrically, on the lower lap-joint plate.There was little or no warning to personnel working on the cast house floor, although some witnesses later spoke of the event being preceded by \u2018rumbles\u2019 within the furnace moments before the actual explosion. At the time of the explosion there were three employees actually on the furnace stack, and several employees and contractors in the cast house floor area. Three employees were within a few metres of the tap hole, with several in the \u2018jump desk\u2019 (control room).For more details, See the full report on the incident&nbsp;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "\nThe&nbsp;blast&nbsp;furnace exploded due to significant internal overpressure brought about by the interaction of water and molten hot materials within the lower part of the furnace.The explosion occurred after a prolonged attempt - over two days - to recover the furnace from a chilled hearth situation caused by cooling water ingress. The immediate cause was the mixing of water and hot materials within the lower part of the furnace; the precise mechanism remains a matter that is not fully understood.The water had entered the furnace from its cooling system following a chain of events initiated by the failure of safety critical water cooling systems. At the time of the explosion, attempts were continuing to recify the abnormal operating conditions that this had created and to recover the furnace.The precursors to the explosion were a combination of significant failures in health and safety management extending over many years. These failures were not confined solely to the blast furnace plant; they extended elsewhere within the company, and in particular to the Energy Department which supported essential cooling water for the furnace.A failure to carry out suitable risk assessments for blast furnace operations resulted in the failure to implement robust technical and procedural controls. There was insufficient redundancy and security of cooling water supplies, and overall cooling system reliability showed a downward and deteriorating trend over several months.For more details, See the full report on the incident&nbsp;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "\nThree employees were killed and 12 employees and contractors&nbsp;sustained severe injuries.Some of the injured&nbsp;remained in intensive care for several months. Their injuries included burns of varying severity,&nbsp;lung damage from the inhalation of hot gases and dust, and serious fractures.&nbsp;Several individuals had very serious burns and multiple injuries of a life-threatening nature. The injuries arose from blast effects, with burns from hot water and steam and the hot gases and dust ejected. Many more suffered minor injuries and shock, and a number of personnel present were subsequently&nbsp;diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.\nDamage was generally limited to the confines of the blast furnace area. The lifting of the furnace body caused considerable disruption to all its services and associated plant. The furnace structure immediately after the accident was no longer supported directly upon its structural columns and was therefore in a potentially unstable condition.&nbsp;Hot materials comprising molten slag, molten iron, partially reacted coke, sinter and unreacted coke, together with larger lumps of agglomerated burden material, had been ejected through the open lap joint&nbsp;damaging the blast wall immediately behind the west side of the furnace. Subsequently, furnace burden penetrated into the water manifold/launder area and into the hydraulic room destroying the water manifold and damaging the wall of the hydraulic room beyond. Penetration of molten burden through a doorway into the amenities block initiated a significant fire which caused serious damage.The profiled steel cladding of the building was severely damaged in several areas, with some sheets being projected in excess of 40 m. Molten slag was thrown over most of the cast house floor and flowed as far as the entrance ramp to an estimated depth of between 300 and 600 mm. There was no penetration of solid material into the control room, although there was impact damage to its front.Areas where gas plant structures had moved significantly were identified after the accident, but gas containment was maintained and there was no major blast furnace gas leakage from the downstream gas system. Significant amounts of flame and gas were, however, emitted through the furnace top bleeders.&nbsp;Subsequent engineering evaluation by&nbsp;engineering personnel deemed the furnace to be beyond repair and it&nbsp;was demolished and rebuilt to a more modern design \u2013 one which does not feature a lap joint.Although disruption to the community was relatively minor, with local traffic being affected on the night and local government facilities used as information centres for employees and their relatives, the exposion caused widespread alarm and concern throughout the locality.There was no damage to the environment.The company was subsequently prosecuted under sections 2(1) and 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and was fined \u00a31.33 million, with \u00a31.74 million costs also being awarded.",
        "Emergency response": "Following the explosion, the existing site major emergency plan was immediately triggered. After the explosion, the remaining furnace contents were still 'active', and generating large quantities of blast furnace gas comprising mainly carbon monoxide. Within a short time of the event, blast furnace personnel had established a large water seal at the gas system to isolate the furnace from the downstream gas systems. The water supply from the Energy Department was isolated. The furnace was vented through its flare stack and bleeder valves.The on-site and off-site emergency plans were initiated, and Fire, Police and Ambulance services soon had a strong presence on site.The furnace area was cordoned off by the Police to limit access.Control centres were set up at the scene and at Port Talbot Police Station.Local government facilities were used to keep relatives and members of the public informed.Overall emergency response was acceptable, and an early review of the emergency response has generated improvement plans.The structural stability of the furnace and its associated plant was a matter&nbsp;of immediate concern. Following engineering inspection, remedial works were put in hand to ensure stability and safety.The furnace was largely sealed in preparation for 'quenching'. This involved the carefully controlled addition of thousands of tonnes of water to the furnace contents over a period of weeks&nbsp;to halt the internal reactions, stop gas generation, and put the furnace into a safe condition for demolition. Once necessary forensic examinations had been completed, the 'quenched' burden and the refractory materials within the furnace body were removed. The furnace shell was cut into sections and dismantled. The lower bosh and hearth material was essentially solidified and was not finally removed until most of the furnace structure had been dismantled.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nThe investigation identified a number of learning points for the company and its blast furnace operations, the wider steel industry, and other manufacturers. These have been communicated to the company and action has followed to make the necessary improvements. Safety managementLesson 1 The company should review the role and function of the Safety Department. It should be better integrated into operational and engineering management.Lesson 2 Blast furnaces are now under the COMAH regime (Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999), where identification and evaluation of major hazards is a legal requirement. Before this, predictive tools and techniques have had relatively limited use within the steel industry. Predictive tools for the assessment and management of risk should receive greater use within the steel industry and other process industries: eg Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS), Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Process Hazard Review (PHR) and Layers of Protection Analysis (LoPA).Cooling waterLesson 3 Sufficient cooling water for furnaces should be available at all times; the supply systems should have an adequate level of reliability built into the system. This reliability should be brought about by good engineering design (including an adequate level of redundancy) and suitable maintenance, and should be monitored to indicate any threats to its integrity.Lesson 4 Reliability engineering techniques should be employed to identify safety-critical plant and appropriate safeguards should be developed from these studies.Lesson 5 Closed systems for furnace cooling water, or systems with equal or better reliability, should be provided wherever reasonably practicable.Leak detectionLesson 6 Speed in locating furnace cooling water leaks is essential. Rapid leak detection relies on good engineering, adequate detection protocols and suitably trained and competent operators. All operators of water-cooled furnaces should ensure that there are adequate measures in place for prompt leak detection.Lesson 7 On water-cooled metallurgical furnaces, where it is reasonably practicable, appropriate instrumentation, specifically designed for leak identification, should be installed to give earlier and more precise detection of leaking cooler elements.MaintenanceLesson 8 Maintenance, inspection and, where appropriate, testing of plant and equipment associated with the reliable delivery of water to furnaces should be paramount. The potential effects of lack of maintenance, inspection and testing in terms of safety should be clearly understood. There should be adequate prior communication between works departments when any maintenance or other work that may potentially affect safe plant operation or reliability is proposed. Formal protocols should be considered for this. Safety-critical items should be identified and protocols and priorities established for their maintenance, inspection and testing.Blast furnace recovery and abnormal plant conditionsLesson 9 The specific process of conducting a blast furnace recovery gives rise to additional risks significantly over and above normal operational risks. It is essential that all personnel involved are aware of those risks and there are control measures in place, including arrangements for effective communication,&nbsp;such that adequate risk control is maintained.Lesson 10 A specific issue with the recovery of the&nbsp;blast furnace was that as it developed, there was an incomplete knowledge of the changing status of the furnace. During abnormal plant conditions there should be a competent senior manager detailed to retain an \u2018overview\u2019 of the developing situation and to keep a specific watching brief on critical parameters, so as to be able to inform those more intimately involved in dealing with the abnormal situation. Specific parameters in the case of blast furnace recovery operations should include such critical data as liquid iron levels, hydrogen levels and trends.Management of changeLesson 11 A formal system of pre-modification risk assessments should be instituted for any changes (including changes to operating parameters) proposed to safety-related plant and equipment. This should be coupled with post-modification safety reviews. The management of change system should include evaluation and assessment not only by the engineering and operational functions, but also by appropriately experienced and competent safety professionals. Duties and responsibilities for this should be clearly identified. Changes to the physical characteristics of plant should be carefully assessed for any impact on risk profiles and should be carried out with best engineering practice. All such changes should be carefully recorded and subsequently re-evaluated to determine their actual operational impact.Decision makingLesson 12 In emergency situations, there should be management arrangements such that there is a clear \u2018line of responsibility\u2019 for decision making. There should be no doubt whatsoever as to who is making which decisions.Lesson 13 Decisions made by managers under pressure from adverse plant or process conditions present a potential source of significant error. Adequate training and experience is essential, but more precise decision-making protocols should be available for foreseeable circumstances to guide and inform decision making. Careful consideration should be given to providing emergency event simulation training etc to build operator confidence and skills in emergency or abnormal process conditions.Design issuesLesson 14 Opportunities to achieve risk reductions by radical design improvements on blast furnaces are very infrequent. The design of new or extensively rebuilt furnaces should take into account the need to improve the reliability of cooling water supplies and to have suitable pipework layout, valve arrangements and water monitoring systems so as to facilitate prompt leak detection and remedial action.Lesson 15 The provision of improved monitoring systems, purpose-built for monitoring cooling water parameters on blast furnaces, should be considered. Safety-specific instrumentation of adequate precision should be designed and installed to address specific foreseeable operational and abnormal operating conditions.Human factorsLesson 16 It is essential during abnormal plant or process conditions that all personnel are clear as to who is responsible for decision making and that they have provided adequate lines of communication. Employees should have a precise and clear view of their roles and responsibilities, and be supported by suitable training, procedures and other job aids.Lesson 17 The awareness of the danger of water/metal and water/slag explosions should be raised among all employees engaged in processes where this is a risk. The degree of risk presented by molten materials coming into contact with water continues to be not fully appreciated.Lesson 18 The process risks associated with safety-critical plant, especially ageing plant, should be thoroughly understood through rigorous assessment processes, with these being subject to regular review. Specifically, with water systems on blast furnaces, a \u2018leakage tolerant\u2019 attitude should not be allowed,&nbsp;especially with older furnaces. Such raised acceptance of water leaks increases the risks of an adverse event occurring at some point.For more details, See the full report on the incident&nbsp;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&nbsp;"

        "Finish Date": "1994-02-09 14:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "During a pigging operation, a 30\" pipeline, bringing natural gas on-shore, failed between the emergency shut-down (ESD) valve and the pig trap. The intervention of the ESD valve from the control room failed and it had to be closed locally. Released natural gas did not ignite, but was a serious risk to personnel.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nWhen the Original Report was prepared, the causes of pipeline failure were not fully identified. It may be linked to pigging operation that was underway, with the pigs possibly entering the on-shore section of pipe at high speed and then sticking, causing stresses in the pipe. The ESD valve failed to operate because, before the accident occurred, it had been isolated from the control room for maintenance work but the need to de-isolate had been overlooked.Failure of pipeline at latent defect when subject to stresses well in excess of those experienced during normal operations. Design of plant not adequate to cope with this although such stresses are not foreseeable.",
        "Consequences": "MATERIAL LOSS:No material losses occurred except the natural gas released at 130 psi for 10 minutes. Actual costs not obtained. However, no offsite losses occurred. Main\nonsite losses have been a result of loss of production rather than\nmaterial lost. Figures of 20 - 30 millions euros lost production have\nbeen talked about.People - Remarks: Since the release was controlled relatively quickly, only those persons in and around the immediate area of the pipeline failure were at risk. If ignition had occurred, it is likely that these numbers could have increased.Ecological harm - Remarks: The natural gas released, predominantly methane, dispersed to the atmosphere and therefore did not threaten any serious ecological harm.Disruption of community life: Since the ignition of the release gas did not occur, the incident did not escalate to have offsite consequences. As a result, there was no offsite disruption and the incident did not become public knowledge.Affected Area: installationThe actual consequences of the incident were not addressed in\nthe various aforementioned items since more serious consequences had in\nfact been taken into consideration. The safety of the tasks being\nundertaken at the time of the failure was controlled by written\noperating procedures.",
        "Emergency response": " INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:On-site emergency procedures were activated and all on-site personnel (approximately 70 people) were evacuated to muster points. The intervention of the ESD valve from the control room failed and it had to be closed locally. It took about 15 minutes to manually close the ESD valve.EXTERNAL SERVICES:Police was alerted about the accident but off-site emergency plan was not activated because it was controlled in about 15 minutes.\nOfficial action taken - legal action: None taken although very serious consideration was given to prosecuting a middle manager, for allegedly, deliberately defeating the permit to work system.Official action taken - other official action: Offshore Safety Division, Pipelines Expert Team, imposed conditions with respect to assessing the fitness for purpose of the pipeline prior to it being brought back into use.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Plant-re-HAZOPed. Improved work instructions have been developed, a reassessment of \"fitness for purpose\" of all onsite pipework has been conducted. Competence testing in use of permit to work system to be introduced.Measures to mitigate consequences: Emergency shut down system to be tied into fire and gas detection systems to allow automatic activation.Useful references: Report no. 620551/1/94, \"Investigation of a failure associated with a sphere T at the Phillips Petroleum Bacton Gas Terminal\", The Welding Institute, Cambridge."

        "Finish Date": "2002-11-17 01:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident was caused by the release of flammable substances which ignited from a petrol hydrotreatment unit (HDH) in a refinery. The accident was notified because of the cost of the damage to facilities (4.3 MEuros). It was classified level 3 of the scale, as published&nbsp; in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso directive,&nbsp; in accordance with that criterion.The accident:A leak occurred at the reboiler seal surface, on the hot fluid side, and immediately ignited causing an almost vertical plume of flame a dozen metres long.The purpose of the reboiler is to provide the energy necessary for the column to operate. The column consists of the pre-treatment stripper, depending on the hydrotreatment unit. It is a preparation phase for the reformer input. The reboiling energy is provided by the output from the reformer.The sequence of events:The settings (pressure and associated throughputs) on the two circuits, analysed after the accident, show that the leak occurred on the hot fluid side (thus containing output from the reformer). The description of the sequence of events is as follows:&nbsp;- 20h23:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire started,- 20h25:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West units called to the fire. Site siren triggered.- 20h30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire-fighters left - Emergency stop of the reformer - closure of shut-off valves due to fault - Start of decompression of the unit - gas sent to the flare- 20h32:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand-by management called and home phone connection made (stage 1)- 20h34:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand-by management called and home phone connection made (stage 2)- 20h50:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head of safety/security arrives.- 20h55:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nangis fire brigade arrives (1 fire engine +5 crew) tasked with installing a second cannon on the west side.- 20h56:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Departmental fire and rescue service called to report the sending of reinforcements- 21h00:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mormant fire brigade arrives (5 fire-fighters) tasked with preparing two 1,000 l/min fire hoses.- 21h10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A carpet of foam laid down.- 21h11:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water curtain with cannon to the West of the area on fire- 21h35:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deviation set up by the police on the RN19 trunk road- 21h45:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-positioning of a 4th canon, which was not used.- 23h21:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire put out and 3 cannons stopped - 2 cannons were kept in place for a time either side of the unit.- 23h25:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deviation on the RN 19 trunk road ceased- 23h30:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire-fighters stood down - Facilities inerted with nitrogen.- 1h00:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End of emergency.As regards the offsite emergency response services, the fire brigade was called by motorists passing the site. Subsequently, 20 fire engines were parked in front of the refinery, as the refinery only authorised 2 fire engines to enter the site, for safety reasons. The 18 fire engines thus waited off-site until the emergency was over.",
        "Causes of the accident": "According to the initial findings and reports, the leak was due to a fault originating in the exchanger which had a dimensional concentricity defect in the throat of the seal housing. This had caused problems with the work of reassembling the unit while stopped for maintenance prior to the accident. It was because the different parts were incorrectly seated.The seal, obtained by cold tightening the metal parts onto one another, gave way during the run-up to high temperatures. The accident thus occurred during this transition phase.",
        "Consequences": "The accident resulted in one slight injury: one of the members of the fire crew injured his back while setting up the water cannons.\n\nThere was considerable property damage: damage to the facility amounted to 4.3 Meuros. Furthermore, the main units affected (hydrogen processing and reforming) were shut down for several weeks. Lastly, because of the significant damage, the technical refurbishment and mitigation plan for the area affected resulted to be massive. The cost of business interruption came to 1.7 Meuros.\n\n\n",
        "Emergency response": "As regards fire-fighting operations, see the sequence of events paragraph in chapter 3 (Immediate Source(s) of Accident).In addition to the repairs recommended by an organisation expert in metallurgy, the operator finally implemented a programme to refurbish the affected section in accordance with the recommendations of the American standard \"API RP 570 - section 11 - Assessment of fire damage\".In particular, the following actions were taken:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mapping the sectors affected,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refurbishment procedure including a visual inspection, ultrasonic thickness tests, hardness tests and making replicas for metallographic tests -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Replacing the pressure relief valves in the section,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Servicing valves in the section.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The main points are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There was no UVCE (Unconfined Vapour Cloud Explosion) because the product was already at a temperature higher than its flash point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It was possible to limit damage due to the fact that the heat resisting lines and reactors did not fail, in spite of the low flow rate of the charge within vessels and pipework, the flow of the charge being&nbsp; an essential element for cooling the equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Because of the position of water curtains, the fire did not spread.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The positioning of the curtains was sensible as regards the vertical position of the plume: This was because the choice of siting of the cannons prevented any domino effect which there could well have been in view of the configuration of the site (units separated by bays about fifteen metres wide).Technical issues: improvements to limit the consequences of a similar leak are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Increase of the decompression speed of the reactor section of the reformer by changing a gas venting valve to an oil-gas system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Modification of a pressure relief valve currently operated at a pressure threshold, it will now be controllable from the control room console.Organisational issues: the operator has implemented dimensional inspection procedures for seal seats in exchangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Special approval is now required for personnel undertaking this type of work, with the corresponding appropriate training,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - For outside contractors doing this type of work, the introduction of routine dimensional inspection reports on the seal seats and stop points are scheduled after upgrading, before finalising assembly and during reassembly."

The plant was shut-down.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:High atmospheric pressure. Dead calm. Ambient temperature = -10\u00b0C.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The piping of an unused by-pass failed because of unforeseen ice formation in it as a result of water accumulation and low ambient temperature (-10\u00b0C). The released propylene created a gas cloud that was ignited 4 minutes later, causing un unconfined gas cloud explosion and a large fire. The overpressure generated by the deflagration caused the breakage of numerous windows panes inside the establishment. Damages to the buildings occurred but the main structures did not present any significant damage. Distillation columns located in the process area were strongly damaged by the fire. A distillation column (9m high) was broken and crashed with other nearby columns. The substances contained in vessels and pipelines were released resulting in a large fire that, one and a half hour later, was under control. The fire was extinguished on January 27, at 01:00 a.m. Inside the establishment 43 people were injured and 7 people were hospitalized. Due to the overpressure, only insignificant damages to the main structures of the buildings occurred within 200m (near to the explosion point the main structures resisted without damages) and limited damages to buildings (external and internal walls) within 400m, while 80% of normal window panes broke close to the point of explosion, 50% of these at distances between 200 and 400m away, and up to 20% at distances between 400m and 1,000m away.

The Authority organized a worker's team to repair the damaged windows and roofs to allow people to live in their houses.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The Authority organized a worker's team to repair the damaged windows and roofs to allow people to live in their houses.MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:After the accident, it has been established that, where residual humidity could not be excluded, the accumulation and freezing of water must be avoided by suitable construction measures (e.g. suitable piping lay-out or external heating). Manual draining according to procedures did not present an acceptable alternative.MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE ACCIDENT:After the accident the following measures were established:1- reliable rapid-isolation valves to be installed at various points to allow the isolation of the various sections (they must be properly marked for quick identification);2- the suitability of building and structure design criteria as well as of safety window glass has been revealed. Improvements are needed in some areas, especially for those parts of the construction that do not carry loads (such as the materials and fittings of the facade walls, type of roof lining and associated fittings, avoiding the use of glass as a constructional element);3- the smooth performance of the rescue and fire fighting services revealed the value of the existing emergency plan in reducing the extent of the damages."

        "Accident Description": "On 1/09/2005 at 21:40 a fire broke out affecting the heavy fuel purification plant of the refinery.The company made following statements concerning the accident.The shift personnel present testified that a strong hiss was heard lasting a few seconds which was followed with the ignition of the released product and that there had not been any noticeable pressure changes (like pressure waves etc.). The shift personnel present onsite and in particular the shift foreman who was staying on the main access ramp to the atmospheric distillation plants, testified that he saw the jet-fire ignite from the top and propagate down (from approx 18m above ground down to approx 14m in the area comprised between the exchangers E1718 A/B/C and the reactor R1702). Immediately the shift foreman activated the onsite emergency plan and informed the gate guard in order to alert the fire brigade. At 21:40 the fire brigade was alerted. The jet fire affected the quench-line with the 3\" hydrogen pipe, which ruptured after 6 min. exposure with the consequent ignition of the hydrogen. The fire took a cylindrical form from the bottom to the top starting at 14 m height affecting above located plant parts, comprising under other the pre-heater of the diathermic oil. Approx 30 minutes after the fire ignited a 8\" fuel pipe of the diathermic oil system ruptured and subsequent ignition of the product. The fire was kept under control and evolved without noticeable changes until consumption of the fuel once the pipes were shut off according to the emergency response plan which had been activated. The fire was extinguished at 1:20 h on 02/09/2005 (3 hours and 40 minutes after the fire initiated) and the state of emergency was called off by the fire brigade at 1:45 h.No damages to persons has been reported consequent to the accident.According to damage evaluations performed, there has not been any environmental damage, this evaluation has been confirmed also by an environmental indicators assessment performed by ARPA of Genoa.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Following the results of the investigation performed by the company and the analysis of an amateur video, the company has formulated following assumptions concerning the accident.The accident, considering the products processed, could have originated by the failure of one of the following plant components.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pipes leading to the pressure gauges of reactor R-1702-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recycled gas pipe at the bottom of the reactor R-1702 having a quench function-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diathermic oil pipe (hot oil) entering or exiting the exchanger-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flanged joints exchanger E-1718, E-1709 and connection linesThe company excludes a release from the hot oil circuit as triggering factor of the fire, basing on the evidence gathered from the records on the pressure in the circuit which demonstrate the failure 30 min after fire start. Also the video confirms \u00f9 the pipe rupture 30 min after fire begin.For the same reason a release from the hydrogen pipes it is not considered likely, the records demonstrate that the hydrogen pipe failed 7 min after fire begin.Concerning the flange joints of exchangers E-1718, E-1719 experts requested the dismounting of the exchanger flanged joints, the joint gaskets resulted to be not damaged.For this reason the company considers the failure of a pipe from the pressure measurement gauges of reactor R-1702 as the most likely accident triggering factor, this assumption is supported by the following facts:1: this part is located in the area corresponding to the epicentre of the fire2: the area corresponds to the area visually identified by the witnesses3 the product release (hydrogen an fuel oil) from one of this pipes can cause a 6 m long jet flame as occurred.4. the product supposedly released would have had a high enough temperature and pressure to self-self-ignite or ignite against a hot spot of the plant like the hot oil circuit.5: the damages recorded are caused by overheating (flame exposition) and were not caused by overpressure or explosion-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pressure measurement records confirm significant pressure changes at the beginning of the event.The company does not have any element allowing to identify the failure cause of that pipe.",
        "Consequences": "The fire has caused damage to the structures of the unit and has not affected other units of the refinery.There have not been any damages to persons or the environment reported.Material damage has been estimated in 5 million Euro for the structures and 7.6 million Euro for the reconstruction, the remediation measures, materials and other related costs.Ecological Harm - Remarks:In the area around the establishment there are measuring stations controlled by IPLOM which is controlled by local authorities (province)The analysis of data gathered by the measuring stations downwind of the release point did not indicate any relevant environmental damage.The company refers, that the analysis of environmental indicators performed by ARPAL of Genoa document that there has not been any relevant environmental consequence.Community Disruption - Remarks:Train circulation between Genoa and Arquata was stopped by the railway company although the this measure had not been requested by the authorities inn charge with the emergency response.The interruption of the highway Genoa-Milan at the height of Genova-Bolzaneto and the pay toll Ronco Scrivia was requested by the competent authorities as precautionary measure in order to facilitate the access and circulation of emergency response vehicles.The event did not have any off-site consequences, but had a large resonance in the media principally in local media also due to a large diffusion of the news and an parliamentary interrogation.Affected Area: installation",

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The reactor B-6706 was filled with about 1,200 litres of diethylether. 800 litres of diethyl ether with 75 kg of dispersed metallic lithium would then be added from dispersion tank B-6716 and the reaction should be started with addition of methyl chloride. On the day of the accident the dispersion feeding pipe was blocked by solidified lithium metal. To unblock the pipe, a wooden stick was used to push (to avoid sparks and any damage to the reactor's enamel). After removal of a blind flange, the valve on the cleaning nipple was filled with paraffin (prior the reactor and the connected piping were depressurized). The wooden stick used for pushing was wrapped with a piece of cloth soaked in paraffin and the piece of cloth was put over the opened valve in such a way that the reactor should be protected against air entry. As the blockage was unusually solid, it could not be removed by pushing. During the attempt to remove the solidified lithium, the lithium dispersion was released through the ring slot between the wooden stick and the cleaning valve and seeped under the paraffinated piece of cloth on the reactor and ignited spontaneously. The worker on the operation platform above the reactor was burned on nose and neck by the jet-fire; the worker in front of the reactor was not hurt. Both workers run quickly to the control room and activated the alarm as they were not able to avoid the spreading fire on a second platform. The first fire was fed by the continuing release of lithium/diehtylether dispersion (it has been estimated that about 700 litres of lithium/diethylether were released). Due to the strong evolution of heat, synthetic materials caught fire: cables, lamp covers, a light globe and finally the tar board cover of the beton roof. The sudden unexpected release of the lithium dispersion from the cleaning valve can be explained as a manipulation error. The inlet valve in the reactor as well as the lateral outlet valve from the dispersion tank were not closed from the beginning of this otherwise routine executed cleaning operation. As the wooden stick was in the cleaning valve it was impossible to close this valve.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:During the attempt to remove a plug of solidified metallic lithium in the feeding line to the reactor, the lithium dispersion in diethyl ether was released and ignited spontaneously.CAUSES:The accident was caused by an operator error during the attempt to remove the plug: the inlet valve in the reactor as well as the lateral outlet valve from the dispersion tank were not closed from the beginning of this otherwise routine executed cleaning operation. As the wooden stick was in the cleaning valve it was impossible to close this valve.",

        "Accident Description": "At around 6.30 a.m. on a Sunday a fire was detected at a dangerous goods transport company classified \u2018Seveso lower-tier\u2019. The fire had broken out in a parked tanker truck. The 19&nbsp;t capacity truck held 1.5&nbsp;t of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The fire spread to several other tanker trucks. Firemen arrived on the scene at 7.00 a.m. after being called by third parties. The operator launched its internal emergency plan. The emergency services set up a security perimeter and hosed the fire.\nAt 7.15 a.m. the LPG tank exploded (BLEVE). At 7.30 a.m. a second tank containing 2.5&nbsp;t of LPG exploded, again a BLEVE. Four firemen standing 40&nbsp;m away were slightly injured by the explosion. Two other empty tanks exploded in the next few moments. The emergency services pulled back for 20 minutes and then began hosing the centre of the fire again. They deployed 10 hoses, including 4 fire monitors. The fire was brought under control at 8.20 a.m. and extinguished at around 10.00 a.m. Degassing, decanting and inerting were carried out on 4 full tanks, of which 3 were leaking and 1 contained propane. The water used to extinguish the fire was collected in the site\u2019s retention pit.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The initial findings of the operator\u2019s investigation suggest that several fires broke out, although it is not yet possible to explain their origin. The vehicles involved had been parked for several days, which rules out the possibility of moving parts overheating.",
        "Consequences": "The area of the explosions was devastated. The accident caused very intense thermal effects over a diameter of 40&nbsp;m (and up to 60&nbsp;m) and mechanical effects with pressure felt up to 400&nbsp;m away (and debris projected up to 1.5&nbsp;km). The second tank with a BLEVE explosion was blown 150&nbsp;m away. One of the 2 empty tanks that exploded was blown 50&nbsp;m away. Tank fragments, some weighing several tonnes, were blown several hundred meters away. The company&rsquo;s offices, situated 200&nbsp;m away, suffered the effects of excess pressure, with windows breaking and equipment being knocked over. Around 20 trucks were destroyed.\nThe effects of the accident were felt outside the site. A building belonging to a public works firm and situated several dozen metres from where the fire broke out was pierced by pieces of metal and severely damaged by the explosions&rsquo; blast. That company suspended its business activity and 6 people were temporarily laid off. In total, 5 neighbouring&nbsp; companies and 9 houses were damaged.",

In these ovens the feed stream naphtha is cracked into smaller molecules. Periodically these ovens need to be decoked to assure an optimal cracking of the molecules. When the accident took place the oven B20 had to be decoked.&nbsp; To start the decoking procedure, the feed to the oven must be closed. Next the oven must be flushed with steam. Afterwards an air flow is sent into the oven to burn the carbon, which is deposed at the inner walls of the cracking tubes, in a controlled manner. Around 19.15h the naphtha feed to the oven B20 was stopped by closing a automatic valve. The 4 control valves (not at the entrance of the oven were also closed. The operator in the control room performed these actions. After performing these remote actions, some manual operations had to take place in the neighbourhood of the ovens.&nbsp;The manual actions that had to be performed were the following ones:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First a manual valve placed just before the automatic valve on the naphtha feed had to be closed. In a report figure, this manual valve is situated left from the automatic valve;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next the naphtha feed line had to be flushed with steam for a short period (called short steam flush). To do so the automatic valve had to be opened manually;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards the drain situated between the manual valve and the automatic valve had to be opened to let the steam escape. By doing so the remaining naphtha in the feed pipe between the manual and automatic valve could be removed;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the remaining naphtha was removed, a blind plate had to be placed under the manual valve, in order to guarantee that during the decoking of the ovens it is impossible to send naphtha to the oven (by mistake).-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally the oven had to be flushed with steam during 30 minutes (called long steam flush).Just before the accident happened the two victims were situated in the neighbourhood of the valves that had to be manipulated. Other operators who were working 30 to 40 m away from that place suddenly heard a thud explosion followed by an intensive fire.Because sprinklers were situated above the valves, a water curtain was available in the immediate surroundings of the valves and monitors were available to the north and south of the place of the fire, the fire was extinguished after a few minutes.After the fire was extinguished it was established that the drain situated right from the automatic valve was opened and the plug, which is usually used to guarantee that no fluid is leaking out of the drain (if the drain valve leaks a little bit), was found on the floor. This drain was another one than the one described in the list of manual actions that had to be performed before the oven could be decoked.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Chronology of the accidentThe two victims, who were still following the training program to become operators, went to the place where the valves should be manipulated before starting the decoking of oven B20. The operator, who had the function of \"oven operator\" in that shift, had the intention to follow them (after he found his helmet).One of the operators in training has opened the drain right from the automatic valve. A lot of naphtha came out of the drain. The amount of naphtha that was released was much more than he expected and much more than the amount that came free the other times he performed this task. The amount of naphtha that came free must have been 300 to 400l, this is the contents of the line between the automatic valve and the inlet of the oven. Once he noticed that a lot of naphtha that was released, he wanted to close the drain valve, but it was already too late. He saw the cloud of naphtha was ignited by the hot walls of the nearby oven. The description of the actions the operator in training performed was in line with the situation in which the installation was found after the fire. The operator in training claimed that he did not perform the actions in another way than he normally did to decoke an oven. Although he was still following the training program to become \"oven operator\" he performed this task already several times (but he did not know how many times).Direct causesOne of the most important causes of this accident is the fact that two operators who were still following the training program to become \"oven operator\" were performing tasks without any supervision.The day the accident happened there were enough operators available in the evening shift to fulfil all necessary functions. In the shift it was decided that the manual tasks before decoking oven B20 should be performed by the two victims. The operators in the shift believed that the two victims had already enough knowledge and experience to perform these actions correctly. One hour before they had to perform these tasks, the operator with the function \"oven operator\" explained to them that they were going to decoke oven B20 and what they had to do. Unfortunately this was not put into a report. The moment the operator in the control room announced that the automatic valve on the naphtha feed was closed, the two victims got the instruction to perform the manual tasks. The operator who had the function of \"oven operator\" had the intention to follow them after he found his helmet. The moment the operator left the building the fire already started.In the shift there was a lot of confidence in the knowledge of the two operators in training. Their training file contained already personal notes with the answer on the question which actions they had to perform for the decoking of an oven. The answer of the second victim was correct, but it described the tasks more generally. The answer of the first victim contained all the details of the manual actions that had to be taken before the oven can be decoked. The operators in training answered that question as a preparation of the examination that they had to pass to become a certified operator to perform the function of \"oven operator\".During the investigation of the accident it was found that the two victims had followed an operator performing the manual tasks before the decoking of an oven several times. The ovens in the naphtha cracking unit are installed by two. Therefore the configuration of the naphtha feed and the corresponding valves of the odd ovens is the mirror image of the configurations of the even ovens. Because the two operators in training assisted the manual actions on several ovens, they where aware of the fact that there are two \"mirror image\" configurations. Although it could be demonstrated that both victims followed the manual tasks several times, it is not recorded how many times they just looked how the \"oven operator\" did it and how many times they did it themselves.Indirect causesAs mentioned above the second victim was convinced that the day of the accident he did not do anything different than what he had learned the past months. If this fact was true, it was possible that an operator gave him the wrong instructions during the training period. It is always possible that in order to save some time someone did not perform the short steam flush correctly, but would open the drain directly to release the naphtha between the manual and automatic valve (2 to 3 l naphtha) before performing the long steam flush. If on the day of the accident the second victim would perform the manual tasks in this way and made a mistake between the drain left and right from the automatic valve, this could explain what went wrong the evening of the accident.To exclude that the performing of the manual tasks before decoking an oven had been instructed in the wrong manner, the records stored in the computer system of the decoking actions during the last few months have been printed out. During the short steam flush the automatic valve must be lifted manually. This action is detected on the computer system. If someone would release the naphtha by opening the drain, without a short steam flush, then the automatic valve is not lifted. This difference can be detected by the computer system. The printed files indicated that the past months the ovens were 60 times decoked. The analysis of the printed files also showed that in more than 90% of the cases, it is absolutely sure that the short steam flush was performed correctly. For the other 10 % it was noticed that in some cases it was sure that the actions were not performed correctly, but for some cases it could not be detected if the actions were performed right of wrong. The data stored in the computer system only gives information about the signals that took more than 30 seconds. The short steam flush mostly takes a few minutes, but is more efficiently not to open the automatic valve during two minutes, but to flush several times during a shorter period (to achieve a pumping effect). This means that if an operator lifts the automatic valve 5 times during 20 seconds, these actions are not stored in the computer system, because each period is less than 30 seconds. In the cases where it was sure that the actions were wrong it appeared that these actions could not be related to one shift or one person. Based on these print outs it can be concluded that the manual actions before decoking an oven are not systematically performed wrongly.",
        "Consequences": "The two victims had very serious burns.&nbsp; The first victim had burns in his face, arms and legs. Almost 60 % of his body was very seriously burned and his life was at risk for several weeks. The second victim, had burns on his face and one of his arms. His situation was not critical.Four months after the accident the second victim could resume his job and the first victim had left the hospital.Affected Area: Affected Area: installation",

        "Accident Description": "Cause, according to expert opinions:The fire was caused by a fault current with a subsequent electric arc in the area of a cable connector.The source of the fire was located in the raised floor under the installation cabinets. The cables are laid in this raised floor.Power to the installation was shut off before the start of the extinguishing measures.\nAccess to the installation (roof area) was difficult and took place from two sides: via the nearest stairwell located within the building and via an adjoining roof area (prior to this, it was necessary to evaluate the load capacity of the roof area with regard to staff and material; this was done by specialist facility management staff). Long access routes (laying a total of 5 km of hose lines).\nThe space inside the raised floor is very limited (1.2 m in height). The fire was extinguished via the openings in the upper part of the raised floor, using the fire-fighting hoses brought in.At first, CO2 was used for the extinguishing process. This was unsuccessful. Then, the raised floor was flooded with water.&nbsp; This was also unsuccessful, because the raised floor has holes in it, and so the water pumped in did not remain within the raised floor area, but drained out into the areas below.Then foam was used, which led to the fire being extinguished successfully. The firefighters had to manually move the foaming agent (individual canisters) onto the roof and into the stairwell (which was time-consuming) in order to feed it into the fire-fighting hoses.\nSafety measures:Activation of the smoke detector in the raised floor; furthermore, the radiation detectors in the medium-voltage switching station activated an alarm. Immediate notification of the on-site fire brigade and of facility management.Before carrying out extinguishing measures: Shutting off power to the installation and to the battery system located within the installation by specialist facility management staff (duration: approx. 1 h).Complete disconnection of the energy provider\u2019s supply cable.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Cause, according to expert opinions: The fire was caused by a fault current with a subsequent electric arc in the area of a cable connector.\nTechnical defect, fault current with a subsequent electric arc (the installation had been maintained regularly and was partially renovated in 2015).",
        "Consequences": "Total loss of the switching station.Costs: EUR&nbsp;3.800.000",
        "Emergency response": "On-site: The evacuation alarm was automatically activated in the affected area. Evacuation of personnel was not necessary \u2013 this took place during the weekend and no staff or any other persons were present in the area. The danger zone was localised.Power to the installation was promptly shut off. The damaged area was cordoned off after the fire had been successfully extinguished.\nOff-site: The fire brigade took air measurements around the location, testing for harmful substances (using a measuring equipment vehicle belonging to the Gro\u00df-Gerau central office). No harmful substances were detected (the measurement results are available in the on-site fire brigade area).In the area of a neighbouring settlement, a burnt smell could be detected, which was classified as non-harmful on the basis of the measurement results.Both the on-site fire brigade incident command and the management of the R\u00fcsselsheim fire brigade determined that there was no detriment or danger to the public or to the surrounding neighbourhood. Therefore, no action was taken to alert the residents or the surrounding neighbourhood (for example using the hessenWARN app).\nThe damaged area was cordoned off. A cleaning company removed the accumulated quenching water by means of a vacuum vehicle and transferred it to wastewater engineering. Following a total loss, the installation is being stripped down by a specialist company.\nThere was no environmental damage.Checks on water channels were stepped up and incoming water was redirected to a retention pond. The measurement results were normal (no harmful airborne emissions).\nThe on-site fire brigade requested two firefighting units and the measuring equipment vehicle.In extinguishing the fire, the on-site fire brigade received support from the volunteer fire brigade.The measurements were carried out using the measuring equipment vehicle.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The Facility Management\u2019s Medium Voltage Section checked all the medium-voltage stations on site for fire safety. Minor shortcomings were detected during the checks:\n\nFireproof bulkheads\nCable insulations.\n\nAll shortcomings were remedied immediately.There are a small number of oil-filled cable connectors, which are checked regularly.\nSince the installation sustained a total loss, reconstruction is necessary.The new installation will include an integrated extinguishing system."

        "Accident Description": "Fire of sodium dichlorisocyanurate (SDIC, dichloroisocyanuric acid sodium salt CAS 2893-78-9) associated with the release of chlorine and chlorine compounds, forming a toxic cloud which affected neighbouring urban areas. The off-site emergency plan was released and the potentially affected population sheltered-in-place. It was agreed with the operator to classify the accident at level 3 of the accident gravity scale (noxious effects offsite the plant premises).Precipitation: NoneTemp.: 26Wind speed: 6.5 m/sDirection: 139\u00b0Meteorological conditions: wind speed from 20:00 h to 21:00 h 6.5 m/sec direction 139\u00b0; from 21:00 h to 22:00 h 6.5 m/sec 4 m/s, direction 132\u00b0; from 22:00 h to 23:00 h 1.5 m/sec 4 m/s, direction 37\u00b0, temperature changing from 26\u00b0C to 29\u00b0CBetween 20:00 hrs and 20:15 hrs on 17th July 4 workers were present in the plant, including the shift supervisor, when one of the workers detected smoke originating from the transit area where 37 tons of product were stored. The worker reached the area with a portable extinguisher and gas mask and found two rows of 1 tonne bags containing anhydrous sodium dichlorisocyanurate on the extreme left of the area and placed at a distance of 50 cm from each other. He could distinguish two piles of big bags in the front and another two big bags on the ground a bit more to the right. He declared that he could see smoke rising from the wooden pallet placed under the bag pile and the bottom bag on the right. He emptied the portable extinguisher, found another two and emptied them too but could not stop the combustion process and smoke development.The product leaking from the big bag at the bottom of the pile caused the two bags above to crash on the ground, feeding the combustion process, developing flames and intensive smoke.Meanwhile two other workers who had been alerted by the main alarm siren of the chlorine detectors reached the area shortly after the first worker and the shift supervisor sent them to the chlorine storage area.&nbsp; They connected an extinguishing hose to the manifold of two pumps feeding from two 10m3 water tanks, which were used for operations under normal conditions. The tanks are located approximately 20 metres from the area affected by the fire. Shortly after the extinguishing hose had been connected and a small amount of water had been&nbsp; pumped, the two pumps failed because the flames had reached the electric cable rack suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground and passing parallel to the front side of the transit area (located above the passage of the drainage channel). When the shift supervisor realised that the emergency response operation was impossible he alerted the security personnel of the plant and attempted to alert the fire brigade and the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (Centro de Emergencias de Catalunya - CECAT) but the telephone line was interrupted due to the fact that the telephone line also passes above the area in which the fire broke out.One of the workers, looking for a telephone, tried to kick open the entrance door of the administration offices but broke the glass with his foot and cut his leg (the injury was considered as not serious).At 20:43 hrs the emergency call number 112 received a phone call from a private citizen informing them that a fire had broken out in an industrial installation and the information was transmitted to the fire brigade.When local police officers of the Catalonian autonomous police force (Mossos d'Esquadra) arrived&nbsp; at the plant entrance and saw flames and smoke rising, they alerted the fire brigade.At 20:51 hrs a fire brigade helicopter making a routine flight over the area reported that the size of the smoke cloud was large and that chlorine could be smelled.The safety manager of the company arrived and at 20:58 hrs alerted the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (CECAT), responsible for releasing the Off-site Emergency Plan, informing them that the fire was significant and that it was releasing chlorine into the atmosphere.At 20:50 hrs the fire brigade arrived on-site, the fire brigade was informed by the representatives of the operator about the fire, the release of chlorine and the need to employ self-contained breathing apparatus. The fire was spreading rapidly, affecting the installations passing through the roofing and the roofing panels of the transit area. At 20:58 hrs, after extinguishing operations had been started, the chief officer of the fire brigade informed the Control Room that a chlorine cloud was forming.At 21:05 hrs the officer requested activation of the off-site emergency response plan.At 21:11 hrs the off-site emergency plan was activated, the municipalities located downwind and potentially affected by the cloud were informed about the occurrence and were requested to alert the population to immediately take shelter.The first fire fighters reaching the site found one extinguishing system of the company out of order due to a missing pressure device.At 21:49 hrs the fire was extinguished and the control room was notified.At 22:15 hrs the on-site emergency&nbsp; plan was called off andAt 23:00 hrs the off-site emergency&nbsp; plan was called off.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Combustion of sodium dichlorisocyanurate ( SDIC, dichloroisocyanuric acid sodium salt CAS 2893-78-9) and production of toxic fumes containing chlorine. On the morning of the accident during packaging operations of anhydrous SDIC in big bags, a big bag had ruptured in the transit area. It is assumed that part of the product reached the drainage channel and ignited on coming into contact with grease, oils, water and other organic residues.Full report remarks:The operator supposes that most probably the anhydrous sodium dichlorisocyanurate, spilled during the morning from a big bag on the ground, reached the drainage channel, starting a decomposition reaction in contact with water; this formed a white cloud and ignited the fire.According to the accident dynamics and to the interviews with the personnel a deliberate action appears not to be probable.",
        "Consequences": "On-site there was material damage and a person was cut by broken glass and slightly injured. Four neighbouring municipalities were affected by the toxic smoke, which caused irritation to eyes and respiratory tract.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localThe real size of the off-site population affected is unknown. Initially the smoke cloud was moving towards the two nearest municipalities, later the wind direction changed. For this reason the municipalities lying nearby, which could have been potentially affected by the cloud, were informed about the occurrence and were requested to alert the population to immediately take shelter.The municipalities alerted are the ones mentioned above.Sheltering of the population living nearest to the installation was carried out by the following municipalities: -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Les Franqueses de Vall&egrave;s (communities of Llerona and Corro del Val)-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L'Amettla del Vall&egrave;s-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sta Eu&agrave;lia de Ron&ccedil;ana-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conovelles-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Llica d'AmuntWe estimate the total population sheltering to be approximately 20,000 inhabitants.Together with the first fire warnings the emergency response services also received&nbsp; complaints from persons living in the neighbourhood of the plant concerning irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract.Ecological Harm-remarks:There were no consequences caused by the toxic effects of the cloud in the immediate vicinity of the plant because chlorine and other decomposition products forming the cloud were at high temperatures; consequences were reported only in areas at a distance of more than one kilometre, when the smoke cooled down and deposited.Material loss:The company had already scheduled to close down the plant approximately one month after the accident occurred. Another plant substituting the old one was already operative.The social cost of the accident has not been evaluated.",
        "Emergency response": "The population affected sheltered-in-place.On-site an attempt was made to control the fire with on-site extinguishing equipment, the on-site emergency plan was activated and external assistance was requested. The off-site Emergency plan was activated and the population sheltered-in-place as a protective measure. The product residues and the extinguishing water were disposed of according to the indications of the Catalunya waste agency.Emergency measures - Remarks: On request of the Catalunya Waste Agency the company collected the contaminated ground area, 25 m3, and sent it to an authorised company for disposal.Post accident evaluation; the off-site emergency plan did not consider the scenario of a fire with smoke containing a certain percentage of chlorine; scenarios of accidents caused by the release of chlorine and the formation of a toxic cloud were considered. These accident scenarios foresaw much more serious consequences than those of the actual accident which occurred. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:The Department for Industry of Catalunya, competent in this field, proposed a series of corrective measures, which will not be applied to this installation because, as planned, dismantling operations of the plant started end of July 2003. The issue of a series of general guidelines for installations producing or handling the same product or similar substances will be studied.The following conclusions were drawn from the accident:\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The use of the transit area as a storage area appears to be negligent with regards to safety and was worsened by the following factors:-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Significant amounts (54 tons/day before the accident) of product stored in a small area practically exposed to atmospheric conditions.-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The product safety sheet indicates that exposing the product to humidity and temperatures above 40\u00b0C should be avoided-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Irregular storage duration: three months.-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lack of specific fire fighting equipment for the area.-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Design of the area, the cable racks were suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground but the piles of product reached a height of 3.5 meters.\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Operative procedures and safety management system. Unsafe practices:-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Failure to recover the spilled product with the intention to postpone the operation to the next day.-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Leaving a fork lift truck near the big bags with the risk associated to the presence of fuel.-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There were no written procedures on the measures to be taken in case of the rupture of a bag and product spill, although it appears that the workers knew that they had to be careful during product recovery and that contaminated products had to be sent for disposal.\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the workers bag ruptures were frequent. Moreover they all report&nbsp; having seen sodium dichlorisocyanurate react with trichlorocyanuric acid (TCCA) with fuel or water in the processing area. Consequently although risks were known the safety measures taken were not sufficiently effective.\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The installation did not comply with the regulations set out by the current legislation according to the results of the inspections foreseen for Major Accident Hazard installations, although the non-compliance did not concern classified substances. Although the operator was still within the terms for the corrective measures set out following the inspection, but not all of them, it has to be said that this does not exempt the operator from the exclusive responsibility with regards to the non-compliance with the applicable regulations as from the date these regulations were implemented in Spanish law.Measures to mitigate consequences: The lack of an extinguishing water system independent of the process, although not obligatory, associated with the failure of the electric cable system led to the plant not being able to respond to the emergency&nbsp; with its own means, having&nbsp; to depend completely on external emergency response services and fire brigades.Alternative systems are being studied.Useful references:The medical services reported that no patients were treated for the effects of the toxic cloud but complaints concerning irritation to eyes and respiratory tract were received by local police officers of adjacent municipalities and by the emergency number 112. This leads us to suppose that the smoke cloud was at such a height not to affect the population of the rural area nearest to the plant, in which there are farm buildings. When the smoke cooled down and reached the ground it was sufficiently diluted not to cause any severe health consequences to people.The fact that the population living in the vicinity was alerted and requested to take shelter in their homes and to close doors and windows certainly contributed to reducing the consequences of this event."

        "Consequences": "Due to a power failure, ther was a lack of gas consumption with continued gas generation, the max. permissible pressure of the gas containers reached, so that the overpressure protection of the gas containers responded (gas release), which led to a safe discharge of the excess pressure.",

        "Accident Description": "At 11:53 p.m.\u200b On November 10, 1979, an overheated wheel bearing caused the axel on a rail car to disconnect and cause a train derailment within the city limits of Mississauga, Ontario. Several tanker cars were involved in the derailment. Many of the derailed cars contained&nbsp;chlorine, propane, butane, toluene and styrene. Following the derailment, several tanker cars were punctured resulting in the release of chlorine, butane and propane. The ruptured butane and propane cars experienced BLEVEs. The tanker containing approximately 90 tons (81.6 tonnes)&nbsp;of liquid chlorine was also ruptured. Large quantities of chlorine escaped, either consumed in the BLEVE flames or converted to chlorine gas and released to air. An evacuation order for the initial accident area was issued early in the morning&nbsp;of November 11, 1979. The evacuation zone was continuously expanded because of shifting winds. At its peak, 218000 of a total population of 284000 were evacuated. The evacuation order was lifted for most people after several days; however, 72000 evacuees were required to remain evacuated until November 16.While fighting the resultant flames of the derailment, the decision was made to let the flaming propane tanks burn out and wait for the tank cars to cool before attempting to stablize the scene and remove the remaining quantities of liquid chlorine. In total, approximately 80 tons (72.5 tonnes) of liquid chlorine was released during the accident or consumed during the accompanying fires. After the scene had been stablized, the remaining 10 tons (9.1 tonnes) of liquid chlorine were pumped to secured tank cars.&nbsp; There weren't any deaths or significant injuries as a result of this incident.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A lack of lubrication in a wheel bearing on a rail car&nbsp;caused an increase in friction and overheating of a journal box at&nbsp;one end of the axle.

The product recently produced got in touch with the exposed, one year older lot. As it happens usually in oxidation processes, the appearance of discontinuities in the product could have enhanced the decomposition process.",

        "Start Date": "2001-09-18 00:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "2001-09-18 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident:\n\nA release of fuel oil and heating fuel occurred on the pipe-line connecting the coastal oil storage facility and the thermal power plant during supply operations of the power plant.\n\nThe accident is classified at level 3 of the accident gravity scale due to the amount of released product (650 m3). This accident is worth being notified due to the  typology of the event (not exceptional) and the particular environmental conditions( effects of marine shore conditions on materials).\nThe goal of the product transfer which started the accident on 18th September, was to replenish the on-site stock of the power plant.On 18th September 2001, the presence of heavy fuel oil on the ground was observed in a corn-field at approximately 600 m from the hydrocarbon storage installation.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The pollution was caused by a leakage which occurred during the days preceding the detection of the release, a provisory repair was performed, the transfer operations of heavy fuel oil were performed from then on under increased control.The programme set up to investigate the occurrence was organised as follows:- visual investigation;- chemical analysis;- micrographic&nbsp; (microscopic); - testing with an electronic micro-analyser probe.The chemical analysis confirmed that the steel analysed corresponded to the specifications defined for constructing the pipe-line.The micrographic test performed near the piercing showed a significant thickness reduction of the pipe wall and several corrosion points. It was found that at the level of the piercing point the material was torn. Several corrosion craters were also found outside the area around the piercing point.On the other hand the presence of oxides on the external wall of the pipe and on the ripped borders makes it plausible that the leakage was not recent.The tests with an electronic micro-analyser probe on the oxides found externally to the pipe-line wall showed the presence of chlorides.These investigations led the operator to the following conclusions:- the piercing of the pipe-wall was due to a significant loss of thickness of the pipe-walls;- the generalised external corrosion of corresponding pipe-section was caused by chlorides; - brackish water was present because of changes in the watershed-level and contamination of the water shed with sea water; - and finally a localised failure of the pipe-protection were the originating causes of the occurrence.The assumption of the contamination of the watershed with sea-water was confirmed by the institution of hydro-geological experts of the Department of southern Corsica. Changes of the water-shed level were significant, rising several metres over a few days up to&nbsp; above ground level. ",
        "Consequences": "The investigations performed by the operator have shown-&nbsp; soil pollution of the superficial earth layers with heavy fuel oil -&nbsp; soil pollution with light fuel oil&nbsp; limited to the sandy areas of the underground, this kind of pollution was contained within the sandy layers by the presence of a considerable amount of compact turf-&nbsp; pollution of the underground watershed localised to a limited area but potentially migrating at an unknown speed.The amount of light fuel oil which infiltrated underground was estimated by the operator at 400 m3 to which the already recovered amount&nbsp; (250 m3) has to be added. The validity of this estimate is questionable due to the fact that it is unknown when exactly the spillage started.",
        "Emergency response": "The Monitoring and Response Plan was released and the following measures were taken.- filling of the pipe-line with water without pressure- pumping of the liquid fraction of the product from the ground surface- search of the leakage point- stripping of the polluted soil surface (approximately 250 m3) and temporary storage in an hydrocarbon-proof area.The operator of the thermal power-plant performed apart from the above mentioned first measures 8 test drills and installed three piezometers in order to outline the polluted area. The method employed is failure points identification by current leakage detection. The control of the 7430 meters long pipe-line was performed. The method employed is failure points identification by current leakage detection. 17 failure points were found in the pipeline section named as \"upstream\" section&nbsp; corresponding to the section between the coast and the intermediary storage facility, and 9 failure points were found in the pipeline section called \"downstream\" corresponding to the section between the intermediate storage facility and the power plant .It was decided to investigate (digging, thickness measurements, metallurgical tests etc.) the failure points of the pipe-line according to a prioritization scale based on the level of importance of the failures identified.The Departmental Directorate of Agriculture and Forests (DDAA) in charge of the environmental police performed the monitoring of the soil- and groundwater- pollution.Moreover the operator has appointed a consultancy firm to:- clean up the polluted ground without stopping the pipe-line activity- decontaminate and dispose of the stored materials - clean up of the polluted underground watershed",
        "Lesson Learned": "Concerning repair operations the operator has included in the parts management system all available elements to reduce the impact of new leakages.From the material aspect,:- the method adopted to identify failures (current leakage detection) has proven to be effective and it is planned to extend the use of this method also to the other pipe-lines in the area affected by the rise of brackish water; in accordance with the results, it is planned to integrate this kind of control as well as the frequency in the context of an amendment to the Monitoring and Response Plans which will&nbsp; also provide for the regular control of the pipeline systems.Depending on the results of the tests the hypothesis of replacing entire pipe-lines or certain sections will be discussed. The mutual exchange of information between the Municipality and the operators was organised in the presence of the competent authorities DDAF; DDASS; DRIRE.In the context of a better information on hazardous underground structures an inter-organisational geographical information system (GIS) is under development; it will inform civil engineering companies about the pathways of underground pipe-lines and underground electric lines.&nbsp; "

There were no fatalities. Large quantities of black smoke were emitted from the resultant fire which dispersed at a high level over southern England and beyond. The fire burned for 3 days and large quantities of water and foam were used to extinguish the flames. Early indications are that some product, water and foam flowed off site. Remediation work has commenced and work continues to evaluate the long and short term effects on the environment, on ground and drinking water contamination and effects on the health of persons in the vicinity. ",
        "Emergency response": "The police and fire service led the emergency response and at the peak of the incident there were 180 firefighters tackling the blaze using 26 fire pumps and over 700,000 litres of foam were used. Until the cause of the explosion is determined and what caused any loss of containment of fuel, it is not possible to make definitive recommendations to ensure and improve safety in the future at this or similar depots. About 2000 people were evacuated. Sections of the M1 motorway were closed.This particular depot will be out of commission for many months. For other similar depots the Competent Authority has issued a Safety Alert to operators and is undertaking a series of inspections to ensure that preventative measures meet current standards.Early indications are that some product, water and foam flowed off site. Remediation work has commenced and work continues to evaluate the long and short term effects on the environment, on ground and drinking water contamination and effects on the health of persons in the vicinity.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The substantial overpressure resulting from the explosion is a matter of concern and resources are being targetted at determining why this was the case. The results of this work will be of significance to the industry and other CAs and will be widely disseminated when known. It will also be relevant to reviewing standards of safety and environmental protection at such sites as well as policy on land use planning matters. "

        "Accident Description": "An explosion occurred at the production plant\u2019s concentrated malodorous gases collection system on November 7th, 2016, at 3:14 am. The workers were exposed to concentrated malodorous gases at 7:26 am when they were changing damaged rupture discs. ",
        "Causes of the accident": " The explosion occurred when air entered the\nsystem through a dried water lock. The explosive air-gas mixture was probably\nignited due to static electricity. Several explosions had occurred in the same\nsystem during 2016. Most of the earlier events had only damaged rupture discs\nthat were used for overpressure protection, but an explosion on June 29th had\ncaused more significant material damages. The explosions had led to decisions\nabout corrective actions but on November 7th some of them had not yet been\nfully implemented. The accident investigation identified deficiencies in\nboth the state of the concentrated malodorous gases collection system and procedures\nrelated to maintenance work. ",
        "Consequences": "One worker was admitted to the hospital. Two workers were under observation for some hours in the hospital. Two workers got first aid at the site. The process was running again at 13.07 after maintance work.",
        "Emergency response": "When a worker lost consciousness his colleaque noticed it immediately and called for emergency center&nbsp;at 7:29 am.&nbsp;Process operator&nbsp;from the control room went to the site and found hydrogen sulphide odors. He returned to the control room and donned the pneumatic equipment. Also another process&nbsp;operator with proper equipment went to the site and together they resqued the victim to the fresh air. During the rescue more than 100 ppm of hydrogen sulfide was measured.The patient was wearing contaminated clothing, which had not been removed. The first rescue department units arrived&nbsp;at 7:40 am and the first ambulance at 7:49 am. The victim's contaminated clothing caused by primary care personnel exposure during transport. ",
        "Lesson Learned": " In order to prevent similar accidents, the investigation team recommends\nthe following measures. The recommendations are general,\nconcerning the entire industry.  Equipment\nthat have been added to ensure the safety of the process must be placed so that\ntheir visual inspection and maintenance can be performed safely. Safety equipment\nand devices should preferably have appropriate indicators or be connected to\nthe automation system so that their actuation can be detected.The\nreasons for the actuation of the safety devices/equipment must be identified.\nRunning the production against the safety controls must not be accepted as a\nnormal procedure. The risks\nrelated to the aging of equipment must be assessed. Special attention must be paid\nto process safety critical devices and their preventive maintenance, condition\ninspections and need for renewal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The operator\nmust ensure that the workers are aware of the hazards of different tasks and\nwork areas as well as the related safety and work instructions. The\ninstructions must include procedures on how to bring the process back into a\nsafe state after a fault situation. Management must go through the essential\nsafety instructions with the workers and supervise that instructions are\nfollowed. Adequate\ncommunication between shifts must be ensured. Appropriate shift change and\ncommunication methods must be defined for operator-based maintenance workers.Operator-based\nmaintenance workers must receive sufficient guidance concerning the work area\nand the tasks, including related hazards, before starting the work. Liabilities\nand obligations concerning activities performed after fault situations\n(including shutdowns and startups) must be clearly defined. Management of change must also include\nthe assessment of the safety effects of smaller changes. The up-to-dateness of\nrisk analyses, instructions and P&amp;ID must be checked regularly. The maintenance responsibilities for\ninstallations that are situated across several departments and units must be\nclearly defined.Also when handling and storing chemicals that\nare formed during the production process, regulations and guidance concerning\nthe handling and storage of hazardous chemicals must be followed.  Internal\naudits and inspections must also take into account the failure mechanisms of process\nsafety critical systems as well as procedures for corrective actions concerning\nfault situations, including the responsibilities and tasks of the operating and\nmaintenance staff.New in Tukes: A short video \"What was learnt\" in Finnish.

        "Causes of the accident": "On 3rd May 2008, during recommissioning of the refinery, the CDU2 feed line was isolated at the production end with a block valve, but not at the feed end. Crude oil was therefore able to flow into the feed line through a non-return valve.&nbsp; Recognising that the line had no thermal expansion relief, the company implemented an ad-hoc system to manually drain oil trapped between the block valve and non-return valve using a high pressure alarm as a prompt to drain off oil.&nbsp; However, with no block valve at the feed end of the pipework, crude oil was able to continue to flow towards the production end each time a quantity of oil was drained off, causing pressure to repeatedly build in the line and requiring frequent draining operations. This system of work was not risk assessed or proceduralised.On 7th May 2008, the informal system of work was not communicated to the day shift technicians. Therefore, when the high pressure alarm and then high high pressure alarm sounded at 09:14 and 09:20 respectively, the panel technician failed to appreciate their significance and no action was taken to drain oil from the line.&nbsp; At 13:33 a 12 inch flange gasket ruptured on the line due to over-pressurisation from thermal expansion.&nbsp; The leak was discovered at approximately 13:40 by a technician. 11.7 cubic metres of extremely flammable crude oil was lost to grade.&nbsp; ",
        "Consequences": "Loss of 11.7 cubic metres of crude oil to grade.\n\n\n",
        "Emergency response": "The suction and discharge valves were closed at the feed end of the line to prevent the leak being fed by storage tanks.

        "Causes of the accident": "Accident scenario and primary causes :Origins of the accident : industrial waste water with too high concentration of pesticides flew into the river Meuse.&nbsp; Quantity released during the 31th July 2007: ~ 68kg of Chlorpyriphos and ~12 kg of Cypermethrin.Consequence:&nbsp; minimal estimation of fish mortality is 10 to 12 tonnes.Causes : Insecticide release occurred during transfer between temporary storage and packaging unit.This transfer is made with several pipes equipped with manual valves. Depending on their positions, product transfer from temporary storage is made to one of the packaging units. Probably inadvertently, one of the valves was not completely closed on Monday 30th July. During pesticide transfer, a dash of product flowed through a flexible that was suspended above the collection system for waste water. Because of this, no odour and no leaking has been detected at the workplace.&nbsp; Activated carbon filters were rapidly saturated with the pollutants load in used waters. Waste water was not sufficiently purified before release into the river Meuse. Secondary causes :\n\n&nbsp;The person in charge of packaging had noted that 800 litres of product were lacking compared to the client's order. But he didn't imagine that was due to a release. As there is a lack of communication between formulation and packaging teams, the operator assumed that there was less product formulated and he must take the balance from reserve storage.\nA homogenisation bowl for waste water is placed after purifying unit; but was bypassed due to works on it.\nThe TCO meter used to control the quality of waste water before release should have raised an alarm. But this TCO meter was out of order at the time of the accident (capillarity supply was obstructed) and the company did not realize it.\n",

        "Lesson Learned": "Actions imposed :\n\nThe company must nominate one person who is responsible for waste water management and for compliance of release limits for industrial waste water.\nThe homogenisation bowl has to be started again immediately.\nThe company must organize an internal audit about waste water purification.\nMeasure devices (TCO meters) must be maintained periodically following a defined procedure. An alarm should be raised not only at too high values but also in case of failure (values abnormally low). In case of alarm the purification unit and release into Meuse has to be stopped.\nA continuous measurement of waste water quality must be installed.\nAn electronic transfer of TCO values will be installed between the company and the Environmental Police. In case of river pollution, the Environmental Police will see immediately the data of the purification unit from CHIMAC SA.\nInstallation of a TCO meter before purification. Knowing the purification capacity of carbon filters, this TCO meter can be used to verify if the pollutant load can be purified.\n\nComplementary actions :\n8.&nbsp; &nbsp;A better communication must be established between production units in order to detect anomalies in the pesticide transfer as fast as possible.\nLessons learnedA pesticide production company contains permanent ecological risks. The least lack of vigilance can have very high consequences. There is a need of clear and precise internal procedures. Operators must be perfectly trained and made aware of existing risks. "

Emergency services took eight employees who felt unwell (nausea, headache, vomiting) to hospital from a neighbouring company. They were discharged soon afterwards. The operator did not trigger its emergency response plan.\nThe oxidiser of the unit producing calcium phenates stopped automatically when it was detected that the flame, which had previously been unstable, had been extinguished. It had already stopped during the night at around 01.00 but without significant impact. The stopping of the oxidiser caused that of the phenates unit, the H2S and mercaptan-type sulphur-containing effluents of which are also treated by the oxidiser (after passing through a tank in which those with the highest H2S content are converted). If they are not oxidised, these sulphur-containing effluents are released to the stack untreated. A similar incident three weeks previously affected five people at the same neighbouring company. The site was temporarily shut down as an administrative measure until the oxidiser was working reliably. The site risk assessment had not anticipated the accidental release of mercaptans. Production losses stood at several thousand euros. An expert's report showed the oxidiser flame to be outside the flame detector field as a result of combustion instability. This instability was caused by excessive dilution of the fuel (natural gas) with surplus oxidant (surplus oxygen and nitrogen contained in the effluent to be treated arriving at a rate of 8 000 kg/h). The expert's report made a number of technical recommendations to improve combustion (reduce and preheat the surplus oxidant, split the injection of fuel, etc.) and suggested that an activated charcoal filter be installed to trap mercaptans and H2S upstream of the chimney should the oxidiser stop working. The operator made these improvements to the oxidiser.\n",

        "Accident Description": "Power failure in the Trafogruppe 3 hydrofluoric acid plant caused by a hardware error in an S5 remote control system, with subsequent failure of the visualisation systems and manual plant shutdown.\nA resulting increase in pressure in a hydrogen fluoride (HF) drum to over 10 mbar led to the release of HF in the production hall. This was condensed using a deluge system (inside the production building).\nTaking into account the effectiveness of the exhaust gas scrubber and the exhaust gas fans \u2013 which could be kept powered and in operation throughout the incident apart from the short interruption between the central power failure and the manual switchover to the emergency diesel generator \u2013 as well as the monitors (outside the buildings), the additional water curtain installed by the plant fire service and the readings of the emission measurement device before the stack, the total amount of HF emitted to the atmosphere can be estimated at 2.6 kg.\nThe emission measurement device can display four digits, up to 9,999 mg/m\u00b3, with deviations of less than 10%. Between approximately 5:00 and 5:30, staff read values between 700 and 800 mg/m\u00b3. Taking into account the fall in HF release of approximately 18% within the first hour following the production stop, it is possible to calculate maximum HF concentrations of approximately 1,040 mg/m3 at the start of the power failure. Based on this, a conservative estimate of the amount emitted from the start of the power outage until the end of the water deployment inside and outside the building would be 4.1 kg HF (1,040 mg/m3 x 1,500 m3/h x 2.6 h).\nThe transfer of the power supply for safety-critical power units and equipment to the back-up power supply (diesel generator) was delayed due to a parallel failure of the UPS (230 V). The UPS would have been necessary for the automatic transfer of consumers to the emergency power supply. Instead, this had to be done manually. In addition, the manual switch for the emergency coolant supply failed. The continuous HF vapours (up to 2,700 kg in total over approximately 4 hours following the cut-off of the raw materials) had to be absorbed in the operational exhaust gas scrubber in the end, as the emergency scrubber installed for such an event did not work due to the non-opening butterfly valve in the inlet pipe.\nThe spread of these HF vapours was prevented by condensing using stationary process water monitors and water curtains provided by the plant fire service. The water used to condense the HF vapours was all sent to the internal waste water treatment plant and treated in accordance with the approved discharge parameters.",

After the part of the installation affected had been identified and isolated, it was decided to let the naphtha burn out under control, while nitrogen was used to push out the residual naphtha from the equipment.The cause of the event was probably linked to maintenance works on a cracking furnace.In order to clean out the coke deposited inside the cracking tubes as a consequence of the reaction mechanisms, the smaller cracking furnaces have to be shut-down every 60 days. The coke is then burnt into CO2 through controlled feeding of water vapour and air into the cracking tubes.Before this operation, the cracking tubes must be thoroughly flushed to remove any hydrocarbon residues, after which the cracking tubes must be safely separated from the naphtha system. To do this, besides shutting off the valves, blanking plates are placed in the inlets of the furnace.In the case being considered, this switch-over of furnaces was being carried out. The required work was carried out by a team. A blanking plate plan in the control room documents the extraction and the placing of blanking plates . In the beginning, the team correctly followed the sequence of procedures required by the operating instructions and the plan. However, it appears that the release occurred, a blanking plate from a nearby pressurised naphtha pipe was extracted instead of a blanking plate from the pipe leading to the furnace which had to be decoked. The released overheated liquid vaporised spontaneously and caught fire within a few seconds upon contact with an adjacent furnace.",

        "Start Date": "2015-07-14 03:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "2015-07-14 15:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Two explosions occurred at around 3.00 a.m. in a storage tank farm at a petrochemical complex: two tanks were on fire and their floating roofs damaged. The first contained 11,300 m\u00b3 of pyrolysis gasoline (fractions C5 to C9). The second, 300 m away, contained 48,000 m\u00b3 of naphtha (light hydrocarbon fractions). The in-house firefighters, supported by the teams from neighbouring plants, intervened in large number. The operator launched the internal emergency plan and alerted the emergency services. A large plume of black smoke was visible at dawn for several kilometres.\nAt 11.00 a.m. the next day, an examination of the floating roof of an adjacent tank containing 25,000&nbsp;m\u00b3 of condensate found an ignition system and a 4&nbsp;m\u00b2 breach in the centre of the roof. The partially submerged roof had not sunk and there was still a risk of ignition.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The investigation\u2019s initial findings suggested a malicious act, given that the explosions had occurred at the same time and that ignition systems were found close to the affected tanks and on the roof of the third tank. Damage worth millions of euro was caused. One year later, a suspect who appears to have acted alone was charged and remanded in custody as part of an investigation for wilful destruction of property using explosives and transport of explosives, charges for which the suspect risked 10 years in prison.",
        "Consequences": "While the damaged tanks and their berms were being emptied, the evaporation of hydrocarbons from them caused local air pollution with VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) for around ten days.\nThe air quality monitoring association measured peak pollutant concentrations (BTEX, ozone) in the nearby town of Berre starting the next day. Two days after the accident, local residents complained about hydrocarbon smells, headaches and irritations to the eyes, throat and nose.\nFollowing the measures taken to reduce the pollution, these concentrations dropped during the 7&nbsp;days after the accident, then fell markedly from the 8th day while still remaining above local averages.\nThe follow-up involved securing the tanks and limiting the impact on the soil/sub-soil, air and water. Various steps were taken, including emptying, degassing, skimming and ventilating the tanks. Their integrity was then verified.\nAs for environmental protection measures, the polluted earth (between 0.5 ha and 2 ha) was dug up. In order to limit air pollution, a foam layer was put in place on each of the two tanks. A boom to prevent pollution was also laid at the outfall into the &Eacute;tang de Berre lagoon. The readings on exit from the treatment plant stayed normal. The findings of monitoring of the groundwater to the south-east of the site revealed supernatants in the piezometer wells and high BTEX concentrations in certain locations. The pollution from the accident may have exacerbated pre-existing pollution in that area. On the 14th day after the accident, supernatants appeared in a spring around 100 metres from the tank farm, outside the site. These were pumped and treated.",
        "Emergency response": "The authorities set up a crisis response team at 5.35 a.m. The security forces closed a motorway exit for 7 hours. The two departmental roads leading to the site were closed for 12.5 hours. Access to the tank farm was restricted.\nThe fire brigade reached the surroundings of the site at around 3.40 a.m. with 120 firefighters and 64 fire engines. Their intervention in support of the site\u2019s firefighters began at around 7.30 a.m. Taking water from the nearby lagoon, six 1.8 km long hoses fed one high-powered foam fire engine and three foam units.\nPutting out the fire in the first tank (gasoline) was prioritised. The fire in that tank was extinguished at 4.35 a.m. after a massive foam attack by the site\u2019s firefighters. A foam layer was maintained until 12.00 p.m. Work to extinguish the second tank (naphtha) began at 6.20 a.m. and ended at 11.15 a.m. A foam layer was maintained until 3.00 p.m. Its floating roof sank 48 hours later. The structure of the two tanks stayed intact. The external emergency services departed the site at around 8.30 p.m. 170&nbsp;m\u00b3 of foam was used.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In the light of this event and the one in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier (ARIA 46767), a meeting between the minister for the environment and several industrial firms was held on 17 July 2015 to examine the issue of malicious acts. The minister for the environment announced that Seveso establishments would be inspected in this connection before the end of 2015."

        "Accident Description": "On Saturday 17 October 2020 at approximately 19:30, the combined heat and power (CHP) plant shut down due to negative gas pressure. Because the plant manager was the only one present at the plant, he postponed the necessary purging of the gas pipeline until Sunday morning.\nHe and another employee put together a high-pressure cleaner in order to use the pipe-cleaning nozzle to remove the obstruction. The high-pressure cleaner was located approximately 6 m from the gas pipeline opening.\nFor protection purposes he was wearing a gas detector. His colleague was operating the flushing hose. After approximately 5 minutes, the gas detector reacted to the presence of methane (CH4), and he immediately turned off the high-pressure cleaner.At the same time, he saw flames pulsing out of the device toward the open gas pipeline.\nHe undertook initial fire-fighting attempts with a water hose while his colleague called emergency services (at 10:13). Then he closed all gas valves in the biogas plant.\nHe did not stop the fire-fighting attempts until the fire brigade arrived.The inflatable roofs on digester 2 and the secondary fermenter were damaged due to the fire, as were the gas pipelines and parts of the control system.Because of a short circuit (burning of the electrical equipment), the entire biogas plant control system failed.As a result, the agitators in digester 1 also failed. Because no mixing was taking place any more, within a few minutes the expanding substrate (high gas activity) overwhelmed the overpressure/underpressure relief valve and both gas overflows.\nBecause all gas domes were already full and the gas could no longer escape through the overpressure/underpressure relief valve and the gas overflows, the gas membrane of digester 1 tore at the seam of the attachment edge.The cleaning of the overpressure/underpressure relief valve that took place following the fire-fighting efforts was not enough to prevent this.\nSafety measures:A gas detector was worn during use. The cleaning activities were immediately halted as soon as it indicated the presence of methane.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Use of a high-pressure cleaner too close to the Ex Zone (approximately 6 m).As a result, the gas pipe that was open for cleaning caught fire, which then spread to the fermenter\u2019s pressure chamber.",
        "Consequences": "Property damage: Gas roof, feed pipes, control elements. Costs: &euro; 200,000.",
        "Emergency response": "The digester\u2019s gas roof was made leakproof so no methane could escape. The feed was halted so no new methane could be produced.\nDamaged parts were removed and sent for disposal.\nGas was prevented from escaping.\nRepair work has started and the work has been awarded to specialist companies.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The operating instructions have been examined and employees have already undergone additional training.\nEmployees have been given an additional explanation and tour of the Ex Zones."

        "Causes of the accident": "An independent damage analysis has been carried out pursuant to Section&nbsp;18(2) of the Industrial Safety Ordinance.\nAccording to the analysis, the facility was in good working order.\nThe primary cause of the damage was identified as the failure of the casing on a boiler circulating pump. The fracture surfaces show a combination of fatigue and residual fractures.\nThe fatigue fracture surface showed lines of rest and ripples, which indicate that the cause of the material failure developed slowly. The fatigue fracture can be attributed to the construction of the flange in combination with the prevailing operating conditions, and the crack initiation to strain-induced corrosion cracking (SICC). There was no indication that the material of the pump covering was responsible for the damage.\nAccording to the calculations used until this accident (in accordance with TRD), the shaft of the casing for the pump was regarded as a critical point and the actual site of the damage (next to the flange close to the circumferential groove) could not be predicted. In the regular tests carried out, crack formation and spread could not be determined.",
        "Consequences": "Considerable damage to the boiler room (steel construction, pipes, components of the circulation system, electrical and control apparatus) and to a lesser extent to the turbine room.",

        "Lesson Learned": "\nVGB Powertech (association of power plant operators) was informed and a working group on boiler circulation systems was set up, in which other power plant operators and technical inspection associations participate.\nThe manufacturer of the circulating pump was informed and has altered the design of the circulating pump casing. The manufacturer has drawn up a list in order of priority identifying power plant operators with the same or similar circulating pumps and has written to them.\nA change in the design of the pump casing with a considerably lower tension level and the implementation of a new testing approach has reduced the danger of another failure of the boiler circulating pump to a minimum. The formation of further cracks in the casing of the boiler circulating pump is almost ruled out, considering the new finite element method (FEM) calculations, and the future regular tests practically rule out the possibility of them spreading unnoticed.\nIn future, a mechanical phased array procedure (ultrasonic testing) will be used instead of a manual phased array procedure for the regular testing of the circulating pump casing.\n"

        "Finish Date": "1988-08-23 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "On August 23, 1988 during a period in which the plant was out of operation as requested by the authority the 23/07/88, a certain quantity of an aqueous ammonia solution flowed in the water drain network of the establishment and through it to the Bormida's river. The overflow occurred in the storage tank SR-41 collecting a 3% aqueous ammonia solution from the amination plant. At 04:30 a.m. the high level alarm of tank SR-41 sounded. The operators intervened and identified the cause of the malfunction, eliminating it at about 06:30 a.m. The overflow of ammonia was caused by the opening (it is not yet fully clear how it could had been happened) of the pneumatic valve FV-1 that was feeding with water the scrubber tower which treats releases from the safety valves of the amination autoclaves. During the event neither gaseous release nor damage to people and properties occurred. Ammonia levels of 25 mg/l (maximum allowable value was 15 mg/l) were measured by U.S.L. No 7 in the effluent of the plant. Probably, these levels should had been higher because in the Bormida's river (where the effluent of the plant was diluted in a 1:1 ratio) have been measured concentrations of ammonia up to 70 mg/l. The effects on the aquatic life and on the use of contaminated water have not been evaluated because a continuous monitoring has not been carried out.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nThe accidental opening of the pneumatic valve (air-open type) with emission of water in the scrubber tower which collected the releases of the safety valves of the amination autoclaves, led to the release of an ammonia solution from tank SR-41.\n\nCAUSES:\nThe water feeding to the scrubber tower was controlled by the pneumatic valve FV-1 that received the opening signal by the flow and pressure sensors positioned on the draining pipes to the tower. As the water gathered on the bottom of the scrubber tower reached a pre-fixed level, the electrical pump PC-2 started sending water into the tank SR-41 via the intermediate tank SA-11b. When the accident occurred, the valve FV-1 was positioned on \"AUTO\" and the autoclaves were opened and empty. A flow meter set-point was wrongly positioned to the maximum sensitivity and it could have caused, for a not clear reason, the opening of the valve with emission of water in the scrubber tower.  Due to an inadequate process analysis and plant design, the overflow piping from tank SR-41 was connected to drain network of the establishment and the ammonia solution, through it, was released into the Bormida's river. About 30 m3 of ammonia solution overflowed during two hours. It was not possible to evaluate the concentration of ammonia released into the river because it was unknown the quantity of 3% solution diluted with water initially contained in the tank.",
        "Consequences": "ECOLOGICAL HARM:Ammonia levels of 25 mg/l (maximum allowable value was 15 mg/l) were measured by U.S.L. No 7 in the effluent of the plant. Probably, these levels should had been higher because in the Bormida's river (where the effluent of the plant was diluted in a 1:1 ratio) have been measured concentrations of ammonia up to 70 mg/l.The effects on the aquatic life and on the use of contaminated water have not been evaluated because a continuous monitoring has not been carried out.OTHER:No material losses occurred except the released ammonia solution.People - Remarks: No people were injured because the leakage of the ammonia solution did not occur in a gaseous release.Disruption of community life: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant effects outside the establishment, except the release of the ammonia solution into the Bormida river. In any case the effects on the aquatic life and on the use of contaminated water had not been evaluated because a continuous monitoring had not been carried out.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of:       Ecological component: common wild flora/fauna (death or elimination) - Affected YesEcological component: water catchment areas and supplies for consumption or recreation - Affected Yes",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the high level alarm in tank SR-41 sounded (about two hours after the release had started), the operators intervened and the ammonia solution released was stopped.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The levels of ammonia were measured by U.S.L. No 7 in the effluent of the plant.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- to convey into a biological well the overflow piping from the tank SR-41;\n2- to convey into a biological well the delivery side of the pump PC2B in case of intervention of the flow and pressure sensors installed on the discharge piping of the safety valves.\n\nThe above mentioned modifications are shown on a map attached to the Original Report."

An exothermic reaction of the fluorine with the pipeline caused the pipe to ignite and burn up.\nOn 12 August 2017, at approximately 03:00, the gas warning sensor on the 12&nbsp;m stage of the inorganic fluoride training facility building triggered the alarm. Simultaneously, the safety chain of the fluorine cleaning process was activated and the compressors, and indeed the whole cleaning process, was shut down into safe mode.The technical facility contains fluorine (F2) cleaning at 0&nbsp;m (enclosed in a concrete building) and iodine pentafluoride (IF5) production (dispersed over four floors in the building).When checking the alarm/shutdown, an employee discovered that a polyethylene (PE) line coming from the concrete building housing the fluorine cleaning process was burning.The on-site fire brigade was then alerted and was able to extinguish the fire completely at around 03:45.The neighbourhood was not adversely affected, nor were any site staff injured. There was no external impact in terms of emissions, as the technical facility is a closed building.\nThere were no employees in the building at the time of the fire.Two size C tubes were used to extinguish the fire. The volume of fire-fighting water was therefore relatively low. This was neutralised via the factory\u2019s waste water treatment plant.The burning pipes were permanently extinguished using CO2 extinguishers.\nElectricity to the technical facility building was immediately shut off during the extinguishing process.The destruction by fire of the PE line (approx. 30&nbsp;m) also affected the flue air scrubber of the technical facility building and electrical ducts.\nSafety measures:Alarm given by gas sensors and smoke detectors, followed by immediate emergency shutdown of the installation in safe mode, on-site fire brigade called.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Condensed hydrofluoric acid (HF) is collected in a 60 litre reservoir, with pressure increasing as it collects. HF is blown back to electrolysis 1-2 times daily using molecular nitrogen (N2).Before the HF is blown for electrolysis, the pressure in the container needs to be reduced. This is done by opening a valve in the direction of the technical facility (scrubber).This process takes about 30-60 minutes.\nOn 12 August 2017, this operation was carried out at around 02:00. The valve was opened approximately 80%. Elemental fluorine (F2) from the reservoir reaches flue gas cleaning via a PE pipe. Inside this pipe there was an exothermic reaction of the fluorine with the PE, which ignited.As the fire burned through the PE wall, the gas alarm was triggered.\nClassification of cause:Faster depressuring (valve open 80% instead of the usual 50%) of the fluorine volume and a suspected defect in the pipe (lack of retardant or age-related cracking) led to the spontaneous ignition of the fluorine gas and thus to the fire in the HD-PE* piping.\n* High-density polyethylene",

        "Accident Description": "An explosion occurred in a pyrotechnical workshop manufacturing fireworks. The establishment is classified according to the Seveso Directive as upper tier.The accident is notified because of the number of victims: 2 people died in the accident. Several other employees were hospitalized for hearing disorders.For information, the accident is classified at level 3 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Comity of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive, according to this criterion.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The triggering event that released the detonation of the bombs located in the storage area is not known. The only two people working on filling the bombs in this building were the victims, their bodies being found some fifteen metres away.As of today, different investigations are in progress regarding this accident:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a judicial investigation (a criminal investigation assisted by a laboratory of the scientific police);-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an administrative investigation.The effect of the explosion of building 9 was surprising. There was a detonation, although the behaviour expected of the products present in the storage facility where the detonation occurred was:- rapid, highly intense flame without any significant blast, in accordance with the classification 1.3 of these products as defined in the pyrotechnic regulations in force.The zones of effects determined by the operator in the safety assessment initially performed were not more than 20 m for the lethal effect zone and 38 m for the irreversible effect zone.Considering the consequences of the accident, an expert advice bureau concluded that the detonation was equivalent to 15 to 30 kg of TNT. The shockwave recalculated on the basis of these assumption indicates a maximum extent of the radios for the lethal effect zone and the&nbsp; irreversible effect&nbsp; zone respectively in the order of 40 m and 70 m.In view of observations made on the ground it is possible that one of the 2 persons, or possibly both, were inside the candle loading room at the time (9B2).It is also possible that this operation was&nbsp; being conducted at the same time as the manufacture of the bombs (forbidden procedure).Hypotheses concerning the circumstances:The formation of a crater inside the storage area indicates that a considerable quantity of products detonated. Investigations finally took 3 potential causes into consideration:&nbsp;- the risk presented by the products usually stored in this area may have been wrongly assessed (the risk of detonation had not been taken into account). It is customary in this branch of activity to classify stars and small-diameter bombs as non-detonating products. As these products are not sold as they stand, the operator did not charge an approved certification body to perform the necessary testing procedures for classification. Storing the products in bulk and in a confined space may support the hypothesis of detonating product behaviour. Nevertheless the ignition remains unknown.&nbsp;- The products stored were exposed to a violent shock and the energy absorbed released the detonation. On this hypothesis, the shock may have been generated by a first accident on one of the two adjacent workstations (9B1 and 9B2),&nbsp; transmitted to the storage area (9A). However, detailed examination of the concrete floor of these two rooms (9B1 and 9B2) revealed no traces of explosion (no impact, no fragmentation of the concrete or traces of burning). As regards the possible transmission of the explosion from one area to the other, it should be noted with respect to the projectiles recovered and the accounts of witnesses, that at the time of the accident, the door of the storage area may have been left open (though this is prohibited by the safety regulations) and there may have been a handling trolley in vicinity of this door. This trolley might have been pushed towards the storage area by the projectiles generated by a first explosion. Pieces of this trolley were found 150 m from the building in the direction of access door to room 9A.- There may have been an unauthorized detonating product inside the room which caused the bombs to detonate when it caught fire. The product input/output register of building 9 was examined. The register did not show that storage capacity had been exceeded or the presence of any products other than the 50 and 60 mm bombs. Analysis of the debris from the bottom of the crater may allow to identify the composition of the pyrotechnic compound that detonated.Hypotheses concerning the triggering event:The initial ignition source and its location still remain unknown. A first explosion one of the workstations would have left marks on the concrete. An ignition source could have&nbsp; directly generated in the storage area in case of improper handling. However, this second possibility cannot be confirmed by the positions of the bodies of the victims.",
        "Consequences": "Two persons were killed and six others suffering from slight injuries (hearing disorders) were hospitalized for examination. The material damage testifies to the violence of the explosion. In all, of the 27 fireworks buildings, 14 are wholly or partially destroyed, 9 are damaged. The entire manufacturing section is destroyed or seriously damaged: of the building involved, nothing remains, a crater of 2.5 m x 1 m by 0.5 m deep is visible in the concrete base; a trolley weighing 50 kg was thrown a distance of 200 m, and pieces of wall 50 m. 5 more damaged buildings will have to be pulled down. The vaults containing explosive substances were only slightly damaged.No domino effect was observed. No impact was observed outside, with the exception of the nearest house (broken windows), the site being isolated, away from residential zones. Two workers are likely to be temporarily laid off for technical reasons.",
        "Emergency response": "At the suggestion of the inspectors, the Prefect has issued an urgent order requiring, in particular, the shut down of production, the removal of finished products and the restriction of storage to buildings in an undamaged state.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shut down of fireworks production, with start up subject to a new authorization procedure;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; removal of the remaining pyrotechnical products from all the manufacturing workshops;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the rehabilitation of two storage buildings, in order to store the company's pyrotechnical products according to the existing regulations, within the authorized threshold limits;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the storage of all on site intermediate products in a third storage building;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the separation of storage facilities&nbsp; between products for sale and intermediate products;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the removal of pyrotechnical products from the other storage buildings;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the maintenance of permanent monitoring and control of the site;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the disposal of all those intermediate products whose expected behaviour in case of activation has been called into question.Since the accident, the operator has cleared his stocks of finished products on the occasion of the 2004 summer firework display season. The operation of elimination of non-saleable intermediate products was carried out by their disposal in accordance to the specific regulations in an dedicated area onsite.",
        "Lesson Learned": "A this stage of the investigation, lessons learned from the accident are primarily of organisational nature:The best possible risk characterisation of the products (according to the kind of storage or transport), with particular attention given to intermediate products. Since the operators of small installations have difficulty in classifying all their products by means of standardized tests, at the very least, a stricter implementation of existing regulations has to be sought;Compliance with the onsite safety procedures in force in the different areas. Vigilance on this point tends to wane with time and at busy periods;Maintenance of rigorous control of the operation conditions and the amounts of hazardous products presents in the manufacturing and storage units.These basic rules already figure in the French regulations applicable to this activity sector.On the technical level, even if the exact origin of the disaster remains unknown, several aggravating factors have been identified:The bulk storage in crates of the candle bombs, creating thus confinement conditions for these products, undoubtedly contributed in crating detonation conditions;The fact that the stored bombs were primed could have led to their mass ignition by friction. This is because the priming process consists in coating the outer surface of the bombs with a layer of gunpowder for the purpose of ensuring the propagation of the flame from one bomb to the next inside the candles;The proximity of the storage area of these products to the two manufacturing shops tends to introduce a risk of domino effect which may be wrongly evaluated. A surprise inspection operation was launched on 12 establishments in the Aquitaine region 3 weeks after the accident. Administrative and penal sanctions were imposed on 5 establishments, and complementary actions have also been taken towards contractors."

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:During the start-up procedure after maintenance of the two stage compressor unit at the feeding section of a polyethylene plant, the pressure at the primary compressor discharge&nbsp; reached a value of 310 bar. Owing to pressure build-up, a bursting disc, located at the primary compressor discharge, burst at a somewhat lower pressure than expected (possibly owing to fatigue). As the bursting disc discharge piping had not been designed for the resulting dynamic pressure, it was torn from the collector release line. The released gas ignited, resulting in an explosion followed by a fire. The causes (a sketch of the system affected is also included in the original report) that led to the accident were:- the alarm signal was activated at approximately 265 bar and the primary compressor was stopped manually (about 300 bar);- the high-pressure switch at primary compressor discharge, which was supposed to cut off the primary compressor at 279 bar, failed;- the safety valve at primary compressor discharge worked as designed and opened gradually (between 297 and 328 bar) increasing its capacity with the pressure, but the full capacity was reached too slowly;- the bursting disc at primary compressor discharge burst at somewhat lower pressure than expected (possibly owing to fatigue);- the bursting disc discharge piping had not been designed for the resulting dynamic pressure and was torn from the collector release line.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The causes of the accident were:- failure of the primary compressor to shut-down when manually stopped;- failure of the high-pressure switch to operate at 279 bar;- failure of the pressure safety valve to reach the full capacity in a short time;- failure of the bursting disc discharge piping to withstand to the resulting dynamic pressure the disc burst.The underlying causes were an inadequate design plant and an insufficient testing procedures of the high-pressure switch.",
        "Consequences": "MATERIAL LOSS:The cost of the structural damages to the plant caused by the explosion and the fire has been estimated at about 40,000 euros. The production losses has been estimated at several millions of euros.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The emergency shut-down of the entire system was activated and the fire alarm was sounded.

        "Causes of the accident": "human error (operating error)The 19/07/1998 the start-up of a pyrolysis installation which had been shut down the previous day due to a propane compressor failure was scheduled.After nitrogen flushing of the piping and heating up of the reaction tubes, feeding of the pyrolysis furnace with EDC (1,2-dichloroethane) was started (10:50 hrs). The feeding control was set on \"manual operation\" which according to experience creates the feeding conditions foreseen by the operating instructions (manual).Between 11:00 and 11:30 hrs there were three heating gas breakdowns (failures of the supply), due to the fact that a too high heating gas pressure released the corresponding shut-off of the supply. The heating gas supply was restarted each time. About 12:33 hrs. alarms signaled raised temperatures of the reaction-tube walls. It was attempted to reduce the temperature by increasing the EDC (1,2-dichloroethane) feed.About 12:39 hrs temperature alarm was released for the pyrolysis gas (cracking gas) and a further raise in the temperatures of the reaction-tube walls. Around 12:44 the extinguishing of furnace flames was started. The EDC feed was increased further. At 12:52 hrs another temperature alarm was released for the pyrolysis gas (cracking gas). At 12:58 the heating gas was shut-off completely.Although the tube-wall temperatures were decreasing since 12:50 hrs, with the exception of the temperatures at the coil-end (worm end), the pyrolysis-gas transfer pipe between the furnace and the cooler burst. The released pyrolysis gas ignited immediately.EDC feed-valves were shut-off. Back-flowing EDC from a quencher fed the fire.",
        "Consequences": "The substances released did not cause any environmental damage and health hazards.\nMaterial damage to steel supports, piping, valves, cables etc was estimated in 500000 to 1000000 EURO (five-hundred thousand to one million EURO).",

In order to avoid a flash-fire or an explosion the gas released was intentionally allowed to burn off, after approx. 30 min there were no flames any more coming from the damaged area.",
        "Lesson Learned": "- each pyrolysis gas tube string is going to be equipped respectively with a pyrolysis gas temperature measurement system for cut-off according to a 2 of 3 redundant logic (class A safeguard). Among other control functions when certain temperatures are reached: heating gas shut-off, EDC-feed shut-off, nitrogen washing to the groups of pyrolysis tubes open.- in each pyrolysis gas tube string the existing tube wall temperature measurement system is going to be equipped for cut-off according to a to a 2 of 3 redundand logic (class A safeguard), which releases the same control functions as the pyrolysis gas temperature measurement system when certain temperatures are reached.- It is recommended to realise in the pyrolysis gas flow for each tubes string a temperature gradient measurement system with alarm, as a help for the installation personnel during the start-up phase. - For the early recognition of corrosion-&nbsp; or erosion-damages the term for inspection of the pyrolysis installation is set in 2.5 years (inspection by an expert). During operation every six months the pyrolysis gas pipes between the furnace to the first cooler have to be tested in - correspondence of the curves for damages by x-ray testing.

The debutanizing column (C-43) should have extracted these gases, which are commonly found in the gas stream in order for them to undergo treatment. Due to insufficient temperature and pressure in this unit, extraction did not occur. The gases accumulated in the petrol tank (2178 C) forming a pocket that spread outside the recipient until an ignition source set off a gas blast. The explosion occured at 8:15 am and displaced the tank's floating roof (2178 C) and began the combustion of the gasoline contained within it (2 400 m3). The fire spread to the other gasoline tanks housed in the same area (C 2) as well as to the outer lying installations. In total, seven storage tanks (8 600 m3 of petrol) were affected, and it took over 48 hours to extinguish the fires. As a result, nine plant workers were killed, and there was serious material damage.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Based on the report issued by the competent authority for industry and work, the major causes have been identified as follows: \u00a0\u00a0 Incomplete risk analysis, which did not allow the consequences to be known beforehand of placing a product with a high gas content in an atmospheric tank, which was by its nature unsuitable for such use.\u00a0\u00a0 Inadequate everyday work procedures in the FCC unit.\u00a0\u00a0 High levels of gas stored in the tanker, which led to the displacement of the tanker's floating roof. \u00a0\u00a0 Late detection which allowed the gases to accumulate. Also, a power cut left without power to the collection in which occurred the explosion. Since then, despite the recovery of energy and return to operation, the unit was not yet well balanced. Hence, for a few days occurs the accumulation of gases detached unit (butane and other lighter hydrocarbons) which, in contact with a hot spot, caused its explosion.",

        "Finish Date": "1989-04-09 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:During the manufacture of lubricating oil, there was a build up of asphalt and other residual oils in the propane recirculating system. They were drained at each shift from an accumulator vessel into a drain vessel, which was often flushed out with hot gasoil or flushing oil. The asphalt and residual oils were drained to the plant's surface drain and then to an interceptor pit; any propane present would evaporate. The accumulator vessel had a capacity of approximately 24 tonnes of propane at 50\u00b0C and 21 bar. During the shift preceding the accident, the drain line from the drain vessel was found to be plugged; after an unsuccessful attempt to remedy this, it was closed. Draining of the asphalt and other residual oils from the recirculating system into the drain vessel was started. After two hours later, a large amount of propane escaped from the drain vessel and drifted 20-30 metres in southerly direction towards the centre of the manufacturing unit. An operator noticed a gas cloud and, at the same time, the propane low level alarm sounded in the main control room. The shift controller manually closed the valve between the propane recirculating system and the drain vessel. The on-site emergency services were called but on their arrival the gas cloud was already safely dispersed.The propane release was attributed to the plugging of the drain valve by a solid plug of asphalt and/or ice, not allowing it fully closing after draining. This plug was removed owing to the propane pressure during draining from the recirculation system to the drain vessel.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The drain valve was inadvertently left partially open due to a solid plug of asphalt that was inhibiting its full closure (the valve was supposed to be closed). When propane was drained, the plug was removed (owing to propane pressure in the recirculating system) and 9 tonnes of propane were released to the atmosphere.CAUSES:A solid plug of asphalt and/or ice was trapped in the propane drainage valve preventing its fully closure after the propane had been drained. When propane was subsequently drained, the plug of asphalt was removed and 9 tonnes of propane were released to the atmosphere. The plant has not been designed with a double valve system on the drain line and the operating instructions did not adequately deal with procedures to be followed in the event of a blockage.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:15 people were on the plant and approximately 3500 people on whole site when the accident occurred but no-one was injured.OTHER:No material losses occurred except the escaped propane (its cost has been estimated in about 1,800 dollars).Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The gas cloud was detected by operator at same time as low level alarm for the propane recirculating system sounded in the main control room. The shift controller manually closed the valve between the propane recirculating system and the drain vessel. The on-site emergency services were called but on their arrival the gas cloud was already safely dispersed and no further emergency actions were required.No on-site emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- an additional spring loaded valve has been installed in the drain lines to close automatically when a blockage clears;\n2- operating instructions updated to include a requirement that the drain vessel and its drain line should be flushed through with gasoil after each draining operation so as to prevent accumulation of solid asphalt;\n3- the drain system redesigned so that asphalt can be drained from the vessel via a closed system, thereby removing the potential risk of a release to the atmosphere."

Preventative maintenance contracts were established for all Type B gas appliances \u2013 with 6 months and 2 years frequency. A missing audible \u2018position proving alarm\u2019 was installed, to detect valve position at burner shutdown. Although the original design was OGS approved with an alarm included, the \u2018as built\u2019 installation did not include the alarm. The installation contractors are no longer an operating business. Operating procedures instruct operators to close the appliance isolation valve manually whenever the gas burner is off line. The company decided that electrical/instrument technicians will all have Type B gas permits. A Type B compliance audit was conducted for all remaining gas burners to confirm their \u2018as built\u2019 compliance."

        "Accident Description": "At 01:02, during the start-up manoeuvres of the Ammonia III plant, near the synthesis column, the weld cord breaks over the entire circumference, made between a section of vertical pipe and a connecting elbow with a horizontal pipe. At the breaking of the welding cord, the pressure of the released gas generated the detachment of some metal pipe fixing parts, generating mechanical sparks that ignited the explosive mixture. After igniting the mixture, the burning rate increased explosively, producing: deflagration in the mass of the cloud, pressure wave and a flame front that affected the thermal insulation of the pipes near the cut pipe and generated a thermal radiative field.&nbsp; After the explosion, the flames remained active at the level of the rupture, where the synthesis gas was still released. The Ammonia III plant was shut down immediately, the synthesis loop was depressurized and inertized with nitrogen.  The fire was extinguished&nbsp;in approximately 2 hours&nbsp;by the prompt intervention of firefighters from the internal Service for Emergency Situations (SPSU) Azomures and external firefighters from Mures Inspectorate for Emergency Situations. Details: Given the specificity of ammonia production technology, restarting the plant after a shutdown for a long period of time usually takes about 3 days, most of the phases of the technological process requiring heating and activation of catalysts in a well-defined sequence and procedured at the level of the economic operator. At the time of the event, the last manoeuvres were carried out to complete the process of commissioning the installation and the resumption of the production process and the installation was within normal operating parameters in terms of temperatures, pressures and flow rates, according to the process diagrams recorded in the control room; the syngas parameters were: 73% hydrogen content, pressure 135 bar, temperature 390\u00b0C. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "As a result of research conducted by an external investigation team, it was determined that the explosion was caused by the failure of a portion of welding to the coupling of two pipes g as line connecting start up preheater to ammonia reactor. The pipeline is part of a pipeline system authorised by the responsible authority, being technically checked in early 2019 and due for the next periodic technical inspection in early 2022. The ammonia installation 3 was stopped at the end of May 2021 to carry out the scheduled capital overhaul.

        "Consequences": "One employee was slightly injured at the site (injury caused by broken window fragments from the blast - no hospitalisation required). There was no environmental damage as there were no releases of hazardous substances. Deterioration of the synthesis gas supply pipe of the ammonia synthesis column. Destruction of thermal insulation of other pipes in the fire area. Destruction of the insulation of power lines and AMC instrumentation in the fire area. Thermal and mechanical damage to heat exchangers and ammonia separators. Destruction of two watch cabins for field operators in the proximity of the column. Breaking the windows of the surrounding buildings (administrative building and CET2 building power generation). The cost of damage on the site was estimated at more than 2M &euro;. The Ammonia III plant was closed for 2 years. There were no off-site effects except for blast noise.",
        "Emergency response": "At 01:02 a.m. an explosion followed by fire was reported on the AZOMURES SA site on the single emergency number 112. At the Ammonia III plant, the emergency shutdown procedure was implemented by activating the ESD system, followed by emergency depressurization, nitrogen inerting and isolation of the affected area. At 01:15 the forces (4 officers and 35 non-commissioned officers) and intervention means (3 fire engines, 1 CBRN, 1 tanker, 1 rescue truck, 1 first intervention and command vehicle) of Mures county Inspectorate for Emergency Situations arrived on the site where the Private Service for Emergency Situations (SPSU) Azomures intervened to extinguish the fire with 12 firefighters, the powder and nitrogen truck and fire extinguishers. The dispatcher's coordinating doctor assigned 5 SMURD(Mobile Emergency, Resuscitation and Rescue Service) and 4 SAJ(County Ambulance Service) teams to the scene of the intervention. Measurements were made by the CBRN crew and it was found that there were no leaks of hazardous substances into the atmosphere. At 01:31, as it was found that there were no particular dangers and the situation was under control, a message was sent to the population to prevent panic. At 02:45 the fire was extinguished.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The importance of the correct identification of accident scenarios in the IEP and of the training exercises (an exercise with a similar accident was played in 2020).\nThe importance of an ESD system it proved its usefulness by stopping the flow of synthesis gas and isolating the affected pipe portion.\nThe importance of SOP for emergency situations and field operators training SOP in place and well trained operators very good reaction times.\nThe importance of high focus on process safety (more focus on the design; check if the material specification fits for all operating modes - including starting and shut down).\nImproving the inspections / inernal audit / mentenance of pipelines and vessels.\nCommunication during emergency situations.\nFollowing the analysis of the intervention mode and other low-probability but high-impact scenarios in the EEP (massive ammonia spills), the intervention of off-site firefighters mode needs to be re-examined and re-thought taking into account that in the worst-case scenario, drivers cannot drive the intervention vehicles using their heavy protective equipment on.

        "Accident Description": "The accidental event occurred on September 8th 2004 near the Falconara Marittima API Refinery, bitumen loading and storage area, has been characterized by the catastrophic failure of the reservoir TK-145, dedicated to the bitumen storage, the damage of neighboring equipments as other reservoirs, loading platforms, supports of pipelines, other loading tankers (trucks) present in the area during the event. The substances involved in the accident, according to the information so far retrieved, are primarily bitumen and secondarily heavy distillates of refinery (vacuum distilled, named hot-oil), present in a closed loop and used in the reservoir identified as the accident source, as well as in other equipment as heating fluid; as in Directive 96/82/CE bitumen is not classified as a dangerous substance and therefore removed from its field of application, while the vacuum distillate is classified as dangerous substance for the environment with phrases risk R51/53. The most meaningful damage occurred has been concerning the human health, because of the involvement of some tanker drivers in the fire of the hot oil or due to contact with the 170\u00b0C hot bitumen; a spreading of bitumen has also been found in the sea water, whose amount ranges from 6 to 30 m3 according to the estimates of the theoretical spread quantity done by the ARPAM, regional Agency for the environmental protection, through a partially buried ditch present in the area of the Refinery affected by the event.The event occurred on the day September 8th 2004 is therefore qualified as a major accident, having a dangerous substance (hot oil) been involved in quantities above the limits established by the Annex VI and having been damages for the human health following fire or contact with high temperature products with one casualty.",
        "Causes of the accident": "As of today, based on a preliminary analysis performed by the operations management, 2 possible different scenarios have been identified; these must be verified by means of further checks: 1) TK-145 reservoir inner overpressure originated by explosion of mixtures of light flammable substances present in the reservoir. 2) overpressure produced by rapid expansion of water introduced in the reservoir. Both scenarios can be brought back to either instrumental or equipment breakdowns or to human error/action. Particularly it is believed as possible by the operations management the introduction of light mixtures or water through the bitumen overload unloading system of the tankers, used for the reintroduction in the reservoir of an eventual excess of bitumen loaded by the tankers to the platforms. The initiation causes are still under characterization; based on the technical elements so far collected by the firm, the overpressure that has lead to the explosion and the projection of the TK-145 bitumen reservoir may have been triggered by the inlet of water, with consequent rapid phase transition to the 170\u00b0C hot temperature of the bitumen reservoir, higher than the boiling temperature, or by the introduction of light compounds with formation of an explosive mixture and blast, originated by the bitumen overload unloading system of the tankers; the validity of such an hypothesis depends upon the results of summarizing all the operations performed in the morning of the accident. ",
        "Consequences": " One casualty and three injured among the drivers of the tankers involved in the fire or invested by the released bitumen; two were hospitalized and only one cured and then dismissed.\nRelease in sea waters through the Rigatta ditch of a theoretical quantity of bitumen, esteemed by the Authorities of environmental control, equal to 7-34 Tons. Smoke column produced by the fire with effects evaluated to be of low impact by the ARPAM. People - Remarks: Four drivers present in the bitumen loading area had been involved in the event: 1 was run over by the bitumen and pushed inside a containment basin, where the body was recovered 3 hours after the fire had been extinguished. Three more drivers reported different levels of injures due to the contact with the hot bitumen; two had been hospitalized in hospital and one more had been released from hospital after medication. Ecological Harm - Remarks: The bitumen search and collection operations in the seabed are in progress, being performed by the ICRAM (Institute Central scientific and technological Search Applied to the Sea), as well as the performance, made by the health Authorities, of specific analysis on the seaclams destined to human feeding. According to an initial rough estimation, the costs pointed out by the firm are quantified as follows: - structural loss: three millions euros (residual value of the equipment and destroyed structures) - costs for the emergency half a million euros - costs of pollution recovery operations three millions euros - cost for the renovation and modernization plant 31 millions of euros The amount of 25 millions euros must be added to the above mentioned costs; it is related to one year (time foreseen to re-establish bitumen production operations) missed production. Community Disruption: The nearby Ancona-Falconara airport has suffered a temporary limitation of operations related to the dispatch of airfield fire engines of the national fire brigades sent to the refinery to help managing the emergency operations.

Immediate participation of the site fire fighting team with 6 men and 2 fire engines. Subsequently the head quarter of the national fire brigade system sends 2 fire engines first, and after around 30 minutes with 15 vehicles and 35 fire fighters. The external emergency Plan prearranged by the Prefettura has been activated for event classified of II category with: - block of the railway path, since a part of the railroad crosses the establishment; - block of the circulation on the roads surrounding the refinery; - limitation of several operations in the near airport of Falconara, without practical consequences; - interruption of the power supply of the 132 Kv line running along the railroad; - activation of the center of joint advanced coordination; - activation of the procedures of information to the population. The fire has been attacked with water and foam coming from fire brigade equipment VVFs (among which two hydrofoam AIS-tankers of the airport type) and from the fixed networks of the factory, while they devoted the efforts to cool the reservoirs and tankers located near the area affected by the event. After around 2 hours from the beginning of the fire the hotbed was under control and the railway circulation had been reactivated. After around 3 hours complete flames extinguishing had been reached. The operations are concluded with the restoration of the safety conditions of the plant as in the respect of the directives released by the judicial authority, which has set the whole area under sequestration Official action taken - legal action: The judicial trial, still in progress, had started immediately after the incident; the area of the firm involved in the accident is so far still under sequestration.

Following the chronology of the events, related to the management of the fire control event: 7.25 - Alarm is released by means of VHF radio communication system. Alarm is relaunched with 222 emergency telephone number. The fire engines leave towards topping via Corso Peretti, since the wind was blowing from the earth to the sea Fire engine n. 24 rushes in first, gets close until the possible limit and starts to pour water and foam with the monitor Fire engine n.26 is addressed in the opposite side of the area affected by the event, from where it begins to deliver water and foam Fire engine n.37 is positioned on the road between the Vacuum 1\u00b0 and the N\u00b0 I electric box in the practicable limit from where it unloads his potential of chemical powder and foaming in the central part of the fire Cooling systems of the tanks adjacent to the area of the fire area start being activated Afterwards two VVF fire engines arrive, locating themselves respectively next to the fire engine n.24 and in the bitumen area, sea side. The procedure of activation of the cooling systems of all the reservoirs adjacent to the affected zone is completed, in cooperation with the VVF coming from outside the refinery. The VVF foreman takes the lead of the operations and it entrusts joined VVF and API teams to tackle the hotbeds and complete the coverage of the cooling systems on the surrounding structures Arrival of the airport fire engines Arrival of the foaming liquid re-supply from the refinery warehouse10.30 - flames are extinguished and railway operations are re-activated; structures cooling operations still in progress 12.00 - the cooling operations are ended, flexible pumps are installed to empty the containment basins of the involved tanks with the purpose to facilitate the searching operations of the missing driver 14.15 - the body of the missing driver is found in the basin between tank 144 and tank 145; end of the state of emergencyLater, the area affected by the accident has been put in safety and fenced for access avoiding. For safety assurance standard regular controls the area have been arranged by the fire brigade personnel.Seveso II duties - remarks: The essential components of the\noutside emergency plan have been examined during the verification\nperformed by the inspectors on the safety management system (June\n2001). The technical information for the implementation of the law\nrelated to the monitoring of the new building operations (industrial\nand civil urbanization) have been prearranged by the operational\nmanagement and forwarded to the CTR in December 2002 for examination.\nThe RdS (safety report, ndr) has been revised in June 2004 before the\nfive years expiration foreseen by law, and is still in the evaluation\nphase. In the RdS it has been assumed the hot oil release in the\naffected unit and the following fire, but without bitumen involvement\nsince it is a substance not listed in the attachment I of the Directive\n96/82.\nAs far as point c is concerned, it is not possible to point out a\ncorrelation among the organizational and managerial elements with the\naccident since the causes are not been identified yet.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons:Kept into account that the plant is still as of today empty and inoperative, within the revamping project the following features have been assessed as the most important typologies of operations:- relocation of the tankers loading platforms away from the storage area and relevant equipment- supply of adequate systems of tankers overloading control and consequent discharge of the excess in the reservoirs- removal of the interconnections or possible interferences with water / vapour networks-verification of the safety conditions of the whole hot oil circuit in the refinery- upgrade of the internal Emergency plan, with particular reference to the survey of the accident-related personnel and to the operational procedures of the internal emergency teams prior to the presence of the national fire brigade teamsMeasures to prevent recurrence:- Putting into practice bitumen temperature control systems in the reservoirs with interlock of the bitumen heating and feeding system from the upstream facilities\u00a0- Putting into practice an interlock system applied to the upstream plants: either in case of loss of vacuum level in the Vacuum-1 plant or low temperatures in the visbreaking plant\u00a0- Putting into practice an interlock system of the hot-oil line to the serpentines to the bitumen reservoirs for hot oil high temperatures\u00a0- Putting into practice a hot oil throughput interlock system in case of discrepancies of the values between the leaving and feedback amounts\u00a0- putting into practice automatic loading tankers systems to avoid or reduce overloads, endowed with weighting devices to predetermined values, overflow sensors, \"present man\" systems and further traffic\u00a0 control measures of the inlet/outlet tankers with compulsory traffic paths directed by indications and signs, bright panels and red lights\u00a0- putting into practice a monitoring system for the presence of possible explosive atmospheres inside the bitumen reservoirs- putting into practice managerial and engineering measures to prevent water inlet in the bitumen reservoirs, as elimination of sampling recovery minitanks and excluding the water / steam heat exchanger from the heating device\u00a0- increase of the refinery personnel in the bitumen handling area\u00a0- prohibiting the direct unloading of the overloads (excesses) in bitumen reservoirs\u00a0- putting into practice an ex-unloading tankers smokes and areosol collecting system with treatment\u00a0- installation of bitumen loading arms with overflow control system\u00a0- putting into practice multiple stop systems to arrest bitumen loading pumps either in the control room and in the local area\u00a0- putting into practice a verification system to check the issuing of a reclamation and washing certificate of the tankers\u00a0- putting into practice dedicated systems and loops being able to handle the different typologies of bitumen\u00a0- centralization in the control room of the indications of the levels of the bitumen reservoirsResponce - Lessons Learned - measures to mitigate consequences:\u00a0- positioning the loading devices in areas located away from the reservoirs\u00a0- installation of frangible joints and anti-explosion doors/windows in the bitumen atmospheric reservoirs"

        "Accident Description": "At around 8:00 p.m. a fire broke out on a zirconium pickle line at a metal fabrication plant. The operator launched the internal emergency plan. 12 employees were evacuated. Staff and the fire brigade fought the fire with a foam nozzle. By 9:00 p.m. the fire had been put out and the internal emergency plan was lifted at 9:45 p.m.\n&nbsp;\nThe two investigations carried out by the operator did not definitively establish the cause of the fire. The first hypothesis would be an ignition of electrical origin; the suspected equipment is a pump motor and its electrical connection socket. The second hypothesis would be ignition linked to the presence of zirconium; the satin finish generates zirconium fines, the spontaneous ignition of which in the open air is possible.\n&nbsp;\nThe fact that the packed tower scrubber did not stop extracting fumes despite the emergency shutdown of the machine was undoubtedly an aggravating factor in the accident.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Hypothesis 1: electrical equipment malfunction (suspected pump motor) - The motor may not have been electrically protected (or may have been badly protected).\nHypothesis 2: ignition of zirconium particles in the satin finishing room: incandescent fine zirconium filings may have been sucked in by the vent shaft. In order to prevent ignition, water was sprayed onto the satin finishing brushes but the flow rate may have been insufficient or the nozzles may have been poorly positioned.\nPropagation of the fire via the vent shaft (aggravating factor): the fact that the packed tower scrubber did not stop extracting fumes despite the emergency shutdown of the machine was undoubtedly an aggravating factor in the accident.",
        "Consequences": "Material damage at the site: EUR 2.5 million",
        "Emergency response": "At around 8:00 p.m., the staff member operating the line where surface finishing takes place (the strip finishing line) heard a dull noise coming from the equipment. He noted contractions/retractions on the gas discharge pipe. While inspecting the equipment from all angles by looking through the observation windows, he saw flames and smoke in the vicinity of the vent shaft and the back of the machine.He therefore set off the equipment\u2019s nitrogen inerting system and the One Seven foam extinguishing system.The evacuation of the site was ordered at 8:04 p.m. and the emergency services (fire brigade) were called.\nAt 8:06 p.m. the manager on call issued the first safety instructions by telephone.At 8:20 p.m. the internal emergency plan was launched and alerts were issued to the prefecture, the classified installations inspectorate, the town hall and the neighbouring industrial site. Measures were taken to secure the site and 12 employees were evacuated.At 8:25 p.m.The fire brigade arrived.At 9:00 p.m. the fire was deemed to have been put out.At 9:45 p.m. The internal emergency plan was lifted.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The cause is suspected to have been electrical (suspicions centre on a pump motor and its electrical socket). The fact that the packed tower scrubber kept extracting fumes despite the emergency shutdown of the machine was undoubtedly an aggravating factor in the accident.\nThese are two specific procedural aspects that the operator must change."

        "Accident Description": "SYSTEM ORIGINATING AND OPERATING CONDITIONS:The component involved in the accident was a pipeline (273mm diameter, 2mm thickness) in stainless steel connecting the oxidizer to the extractor (as shown on page 2 of Annex 1 attached to the Original Report).ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:- 22:15: The failure of some automatic control devices of the unit activating the alarms and 20 valves switch to safety position in one of the production chains.- 22:19: Wrong attempts by the operators to repair the control system without following the required safety procedures caused the complete failure of the automatic control devices. All the remotely controlled devices remained fixed in the position of that moment and some valves, that could have been closed manually, remained opened. As those valves were necessary for the isolation of the various sections of the production chain, the solution passed from the oxidation to the extraction step and back again via the pipeline.- 23:09: An abrupt increase of temperature (from 70 to 200\u00b0C in less than 5 minutes) and pressurisation of the accident section caused the rupture of the connecting pipeline. The pipeline rupture was then immediately followed by the fire of the released solution.- 23:30: Arrival of first aid and emergency intervention teams.- 01:29: The fire was extinguished.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nThe decomposition of hydrogen peroxide resulted in the pressurization and the following rupture of the pipeline connecting the oxidizer to the extractor.\n\nCAUSES: \nThe most probable cause for the pipeline rupture was the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (gaseous oxygen formation and temperature/pressure increase) due to the presence of unstabilizing agents in suspension (metallic particles, rust). The initiating event was the failure of the automatic control devices together with a series of human errors during the attempt to repair them. Particularly, the safety procedures followed were not suitable for the event. Furthermore these procedures were not fully applied. Some valves, that could be manually closed, remained opened. As those valves were necessary for the isolation of the various sections of the production chain, the solution passed from the oxidation to the extraction step and back again via the pipeline. The overflowing of the fire extinction water to the natural environment was due to the under-dimensioning of the containment basin designed for this purpose.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:1 person was killed by the explosion whilst 2 people were injured by the release.MATERIAL LOSS:The accident caused the destruction of 25% of the installations (about 1,000 m2) that is 2/3 of one of the two production units. The cost of the material damages, together with the production loss, was estimated in about 300 Millions of French Francs. ECOLOGICAL HARM: Polluted (by organic solvents based on derivates from anthrachinone and cyclohexylene and hydrogen peroxide) fire extinction water (about 1,000 m3) was released in a nearby channel and two rivers. No mortality of fishes was detected.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:When the accident occurred, the sounding alarms on-site and the spectacular visible external effects (explosion, smoke, flames) caused unjustified and inappropriate behaviour of the surrounding population.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX.

Subsequently the fire prevention coordinator inspected the affected section. When he opened the staircase-door leading to the waste water treatment room he saw that the room was filled with fumes. He alerted immediately the onsite fire brigade. The fire brigade intervened and sprayed the room with water. The lid of a batch tank in the waste water treatment plant had been ripped off and displaced. The 4 daily-service tanks placed on the tank, containing hydrogen chloride (HCL CAS 7647-01-0), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, CAS 8007-3-5), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCL, CAS 7681-52-9) and sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH, CAS 1310-73-2), were displaced and tilted. Piping of the batch tank and the daily-service tanks had ripped off. The batch tank with a volume of approximately 15m3 was filled up to 78% corresponding to a volume of 11,7m3. The daily service tank with a volume of 300l are filled to maximally 70%, this corresponds to a maximal volume per tank of 210 litres.The tank rupture was caused by the exothermic reaction of waste water with added H2O2 (overdosage), inducing an explosion type foam (gas) formation. Consequent to piping rupture the chemicals in the daily service tanks leaked out, HCl and NaCl reacted forming chlorine gas. The leaked chemicals and the fire brigade's spray-water were collected in a retention pond and disposed externally. The volume of the polluted water amounts to 21m3 with a pH of 1.1 and an HCl content of 3,5 g/l.6 persons were hospitalised as precautionary measure and dismissed the next day fit for work.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The explosion of a charge-tank (15m3) in a cyanide detoxifying installation was caused by a massive over-dosage of hydrogen peroxide into the waste water containing heavy metals.

        "Emergency response": "On-site:The entire staff was evacuated from the company's premises. The management was informed by the fire prevention coordinator and arrived on the accident place. Controls were performed at emergency gathering point, checking that all staff members had effectively left the company's premises. The fire brigade was informed about which switch cabinets to shut-off in order to interrupt the chemical dosing process. The fire brigade attempted to contain the gas release (hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas) with extinguishing water. The composition of the leaked medium was analysed before disposal, once the emergency was called off. Staff members of the waste water department and the production department secured important equipment using auto-respirators.Containment of hydrochloric vapours by precipitation with extinguishing water, securing the equipment in the production shop and the waste water treatment shop as well as in the technical room. Opening of the large slide doors of the waste water treatment hangar in order to disperse the hydrochloric acid vapours.External services:Securing of the accident place. Immediate control that all persons had reached the emergency gathering point. Containment of the hydrochloric vapours with water sprays. The switch cabinet of the chemical dosing system was shut-off under guidance.Evacuation:All persons present in the building left the building with their own forces and reached the emergency gathering point.Decontamination:All equipment in the waste water treatment shop was cleaned respectively neutralised with a specific detergent by a specialised cleaning company during the third shift, other affected production halls and the technical shop were also cleaned with specific detergents. &nbsp;Restoration:The batch tank and the piping system will be completely rebuilt. Affected switch cabinets, in the waste water treatment department, the production shops and the technical room, have either been completely substituted or components exchanged.",

The&nbsp;SIA recommends that, together with the Rescue Department, the Ministry of the Interior ensures that, in their rescue planning, industrial premises prepare for fires identified as longer-lasting or more extensive, or other dangerous situations of this kind.\nIn their rescue plans, neither industrial plant had prepared for extensive, long-lasting incidents requiring special management measures, cooperation, a range of preparations and, for example, the arrangement of replacement personnel and maintenance.\n2.&nbsp;The&nbsp;SIA recommends that the Rescue Departments\u2019 partner network plans arrangements based on which the use of foam as an extinguishing agent is always fast and thorough, and ask the rescue departments to implement such arrangements.\nWater is the primary extinguishing agent in rescue operations, but water is not very suitable for extinguishing burning liquids. Strong preparedness to use foam is required in such situations. The need to use foam should be identified as soon as possible and the foam should be fired quickly, based on a simple command.\n3. The SIA also recommends that the Ministry of the Environment supplements the instructions included in the fire safety regulations for buildings, which stipulate that the principles of fire compartmentalisation also apply to external pipelines and other installations.\nPlastic pipelines were running along the roof of the titanium dioxide plant and the fire spread rapidly along them. Burning plastic fell from the pipelines onto the roofing material, which caught fire.\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Safety Investigation Authority also recommends that the Ministry of the Environment supplement the instructions included in the fire safety regulations for buildings, which stipulate that the principles of fire compartmentalisation also apply to external pipelines and other installations.\n&nbsp;\n"

        "Accident Description": "As a result of a failure of the public power supply there have been problems with telephoning. Possibly due to an overburdening of the telephone net companies have trouble reaching the Chemical Incident Number in the period just after the power failure. No reports have come in at CIN (Chemical Incident Network Line) between 13.40 and 13.56 hour. Therefore, directly or indirectly due to the complete power failure the TDF/Tiofine company was not able to inform the public services at once (exact information about this problem can not be retrieved any more). It took about 8 minutes to inform the Police Alarm Centre via the CIN.\nThe chlorine went underneath the chlorine detection system which was located at the height of 3 metres. This may explain why the emission went unnoticed and why no gas alarm was given. Another factor of influence may have been that due to the power failure the system was not working anyway. Unfortunately it is not possible to retrieve the exact reason why the gas detection system did not function. As a result the company did not notice the emission at all. A telephone call from the neighbouring company learned them about the existing problem. As described earlier there was nothing left to do but examining the effects of the accident. The following evacuation process was very chaotic.",
        "Causes of the accident": "- Failure in public power supply- Failure of emergency power supply of TDF Tiofine- System error in that the valve to the chimney is closed during a power failure.- Failure of the chlorine gas detection system through a power failure and/or a design error.- Procedural error in that TDF personnel awaited the consequences of the incident too passively.- In general, a relatively low safety policy at TDF/Tiofine.&nbsp; ",

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:On February 2, 1989 maintenance works for installing some flanges on the fire-fighting system of the storage tank were in progress in order to allow an operation test of the foam circuit. The works consisted in cleaning the pipes internal (the presence of small holes was also suspected). The foam pipe had been already cut and, when a worker attempted to light a torch by a briquet, an explosion occurred. The subsequent fire was quickly extinguished by application of suitable foam already available in the establishment. The activities relevant to this maintenance works can be summarized as follows: - 16/12/88: Operations department requested the verification of the fire fighting system. The maintenance department took over the activities and called an external contractor. The extent of works was normally defined by maintenance department without the intervention of operation department. The aim was to repair the network by installing flanges and perform a hydraulic pressure test. Hence the presence of small holes on the fire water pipes can be suspected. These works had to be performed over an empty tank and piping.- 25/01/89: Initiation of maintenance works.- 26/01/89: Interruption of maintenance works according to the instructions of the maintenance department because more urgent works had to be executed in another part of the plant.- 30/01/89: Production department put the storage tank again in operation by filling it up with benzene, believing that maintenance works had been completed.- 02/02/89: Maintenance department ordered maintenance works to be resumed since they had not been informed by the production department that the storage tank had been put in service. The work permit had been also erroneously co-signed by the production department. When a worker lighted the torch a fire started at the open foam pipe and through this was transmitted to the storage tank which exploded.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:Investigations revealed that maintenance works were in progress though the tank had been filled with benzene and that the glass membrane of the foam chamber was missing, allowing benzene vapours into the foam pipes. The main cause of the accident was the lack of coordination between the maintenance and the production departments because:- no information of production department on the progress of maintenance work;- the maintenance department was not informed by the production department that storage tank had been put again in operation;- the production department signed the work-permit though the tank had been filled with benzene;- the change of service (from styrene to benzene) was not declared according to the procedures and therefore the maintenance department responsible for the execution of these works had not been informed that the tank was filled with benzene;- the glass membrane on the foam chamber was missing;- no nitrogen blanketing was used in storing benzene in a fixed-roof tank.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:1 person was killed and 3 injured by the explosion.MATERIAL LOSS:The explosion destroyed the storage tank (it had been lifted for about 1m from the ground and landed on a side) but no data are available about its cost.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Protection of the ?? by cooling with water. The subsequent fire was quickly extinguished by application of suitable foam already available in the establishment.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- compilation of written maintenance procedures;\n2- introduction of quality assurance procedure for maintenance works;\n3- use of nitrogen blanketing in fixed roof tanks storing highly flammable liquids (this point had been mandatory for critical atmospheric tanks).Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, it was established to use weak roof-to-shell seams (this point had been mandatory for critical atmospheric tanks) in order to allow the rupture of the roof instead of the bottom part of the tank in case of internal overpressure. A guideline for this point had been established by the Environment Minister together with Norsolor firm."

        "Accident Title": "Explosion of tank truck with chemical waste",
        "Start Date": "2016-02-26 15:30:00",
        "Finish Date": "2016-02-26 17:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "A runaway reaction in a tank truck which was being processed by means of direct injection into a rotating drum furnace caused pressure to build up in that tank truck. That build-up of pressure caused the bursting disk to burst, the safety valve to open and then the tank truck to split open. As the tank truck split open, the gas cloud which had been released via the safety valve was ignited. The force with which the tank truck split open caused other tank trucks nearby to move and some of them to be torn open, resulting in a pool fire. Account of events before the accident - On 25 February at 15:50 the processing of the product started. A temperature of 55 \u00b0C was then measured in the line from the truck to the furnace. The tank was delivered on 25 February at 10:00 and the delivery temperature was 35 \u00b0C. The aim was to start processing at 12:00, but this could not be done because the product was too viscous and the tank was warmed up with steam (6 bar - 160 \u00b0C). At 15:50 it was decided to try again to start the processing and from that time the temperature in the feedline was logged. The temperature in the tank itself was lower than the temperature measured in the feedline because the measurement was taken in the feedline to the furnace, where the product had been additionally warmed up through tracing. - On 26 February at around 10:00 (the steam (heating) to the tank was still on) it was noted that the N2 flow, press the tank empty, dropped, but the supply to the furnace remained the same. This indicated that a different mechanism (see below) was causing pressure in the tank. - On 26 February 2016 at around 11:00 the steam heating of the tank was stopped after inspecting it and checking the temperature gauge on the tank, which read 45\u00b0 C at that moment. The log shows that at that moment the temperature in the feedline was 124 \u00b0C.\n- On 26 February between 11:30 and 12:00 there was a brief standstill in the direct injection owing to the normal operation of the incineration process in the oven itself. During that standstill the gas release outlet from the tank to the furnace was opened automatically because of high pressure in the tank. This was not noticed by the operators.\n- On 26 February at 12:00 the direct injection was started again. After that start N2 flow was no longer required in order to feed the furnace (the pressure in the tank itself was apparently sufficient). The feed flow to the furnace fluctuated a lot after the stoppage. This was possibly attributable to gas bubbles in the product being fed into the furnace. Those gas bubbles posed a problem for the flow gauge. Later on, the pressure built up more and more: The gas release outlet to the furnace was more and more open, the tank\u2019s bursting disc and safety valve opened and finally the tank burst at 15:33. The operators present at the tank truck fled when the safety valve opened. Therefore nobody was injured.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "Cause of the build-up of pressure in the tank: - Build-up of pressure resulting from a (runaway) decomposition reaction: At laboratory scale the waste flow showed an exothermic polymerisation reaction at a temperature of 129 \u00b0C (in practice 120 \u00b0C). At higher temperatures a decomposition reaction takes place. For ACA itself that decomposition temperature is 157 \u00b0C, but for the waste flow it is lower. - The tank was heated with steam for 20 hours. During the inspection visit on 3 May 2016 the firm explained that the log showed that this was the first time that the heating on the tank itself stayed on for so long. There is no rule for tank heating time because this was not regarded as critical before the accident. It is a mere coincidence that on previous occasions the heating had never been on for so long. Although there is a concern to prevent blockages in the feedline to the furnace and therefore the heating is left on for long enough. The handling fiche for direct injection states that the tank should be additionally heated to 40 \u00b0C. This temperature should be checked during inspection rounds. This would show that the temperature measurement on the tank itself read 45 \u00b0C at the moment when the heating was turned off. - Calculations made by the firm show that, in view of the heating method (halfcoil connected to 6 bar steam), the heating period, the reduction of the quantity of product in the tank as a result of the feed and the properties of the product, it is possible that the temperature at which the decomposition reaction starts was in fact reached in the tank. Those calculations also took into account the product\u2019s viscosity, which hampers heat transfer such that in places higher temperatures could be reached. - This information was not known to the firm before the accident and so no attention was paid to this aspect when the firm accepted the product for processing or when changes were made to the processing.\n",
        "Consequences": "Truck parking for direct injection completly destroyed.All rotary kilns out of service due to fire damage for about a week, one month and 4 months.",
        "Emergency response": "Evacuation of the site went smootly.Fire's were put out by the public fire brigade. Additional fire water supply was necessary.A large part of the site was flooded by fire water, hindering fire fighting.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The properties of the most hazardous product in a waste stream are insufficient to determine the properties of the whole stream. In future the customer will be asked to provide more information on the properties of the actual waste stream. The firm itself will analyse these data more thoroughly.\n- For streams which are being heated it is important to know the SADT (Self Accelerating Decomposition Temperature). The firm\u2019s experience shows that this is not always known by the customer. In order to determine the SADT, the firm has bought apparatus in order to be able to carry out these tests. The tests show that at present the firm cannot process the ACA waste stream. The firm explains that a possible solution might be to thin the stream, but this needs to be assessed further."

        "Accident Description": "An operator switched-off the electric supply system at the main switch about 45 seconds after the first explosion.OTHER SYSTEMS INVOLVED AND OPERATING CONDITIONS:Low pressure production system including gasholder for acetylene.The accident occurred during a filling operation of a charge of 100 cylinders from an acetylene gasholder. The filling operation was started in the charging room at 07:00. The filling operation was proceeding smoothly without the operators observing anything unusual (an operator inspected the front of the racks at 09:00 and everything was normal). No particular action by the operators were taken immediately prior to the explosions. The first explosion occurred at 09:10 and the second 10-15 seconds later. Soon after, an operator switched off the electric supply system at the main switch. Part of the roof blew off, windows were blown out and part of the wall between the charging room and the electrical room collapsed. Fires broke out and further explosions occurred. 11 cylinders were either completely ruptured or partially opened. Deflagration or detonation occurred in the piping system and likely in the cylinders. Acetylene was released from the gasholder. This release was either due to continued gas production after the compressors were stopped or acetylene back flow from the high-pressure system where valves were leaking after their seats had melted. The local fire brigade was mobilized (32 firefighters involved) from Holbaek in extinguishing the fire. Cooling by means of water was continued for 24 hours before all the valves could be closed. Cylinders which have been exposed to fire were emptied outdoors.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:The initiating event may have been either a leaking high-pressure hose or a decomposition of acetylene causing pipe rupture and therefore an explosive gas release into the charging room. The underlying causes that led to a leakage from a high-pressure hose were an insufficient component design and an inadequate maintenance program.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 1 person was injured (and hospitalized but for observation for shock only) by the explosion.MATERIAL LOSS:The explosions and the following fires damaged the building, the cylinders filling equipment and the pressure cylinders.

The explosions destroyed&nbsp; two dryers, a building for the weighing and dosage of the crude substances utilised for the production of cartridges powders and a reinforced concrete building (unused since the last world war waiting for demolition).In the weighing room (22 F and G) some polyethylene tanks caught fire but this was limited only to that room",
        "Causes of the accident": "To verify the probable causes the competent authority sequestrated the plant, beginning an investigation and nominating a CTU expert.Actually it is impossible to give any precise information regarding the event as the outcome of the inspection is not yet public.However the establishment gave some detailed evaluation through the Delegate Councilor, see Full Report A Occurrence Point 5. To individuate the probable causes the competent judgemental authority sequestrated the plant, to begin a series of technical examination and verification.The establishment prepared an accident reconstruction as the magistrature did not end its investigation, on the basis of its study and the judgements of an International Technical Committee (called by the AFEMS (Associazione Fabbricanti Europei Munizioni Sportive, European playful munition manufacturer association).We need some introduction deduced by the declaration of the establishment to understand their hypothesis:\"The establishment produces hunting cartridges, for smooth tube rifle, and powders for this kind of cartridges composed by the 90% of cellulose nitrate, 9% of nitroglycerin and 1% of diphenylamine as stabilizer.Powder is produced mixing the synthesis cellulose nitrate with biscuit, with recovery powder from the discharge of military munitions and recovery hunting powders from production discards, with solvents composed by diphenylamine, combining everything in the paste mixers. Before use the obtained product is subjected to further procedures. The cartridge case are produced by a specific hot procedure of the plastic, the cartridges are prepared in specific rooms with special automatic cycle machines.The water from raw materials used for the powders production is eliminated using the dryers, before their mixing.The establishment is constituted by many infrastructures placed in a quadrangular area with a dimension of 700 x 700 Mt, delimitated by a double perimetric enclosure (the internal one has antintrusion sensors)\".As regards the accident, \" we underline that the explosions occurred in the following infrastructures: - the dryer n\u00b0 41, where the hunting powders, the recovery powder from the discharge of military munitions and the cellulose nitrate were dehumidified;- the dryer 21N for the cellulose nitrate dehumidification;- the weighing and dosage building (35A) of the raw materials used for the powders production, where arrived the dried substances ready to be mixed;- the bunker complex (10C), totally abandoned;- the weighing and storage building (22F/G) of hunting powders.The explosions caused:\" - in the unit 10C a crater with the complete destruction of the towering structures. The crater has a diameter of about 9 meters with round borders and sweet curving. This kind of characteristic means that the explosive substance that caused it was a type at a low speed of explosion, a deflagrating one, like a propellant for rockets (military type) that explodes in the floor in a limited environment;- in the dryer 41 there were 560 Kg of cellulose nitrate, 800/900 Kg of hunting powder , both in the drying phase, and 180 Kg of cellulose nitrate completely dry, the accident destroyed the building creating two craters, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate them;- in the dryer 21N there were 1440 Kg of cellulose nitrate in the drying phase, the accident destroyed the building creating three little craters, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate them;- in the weighing and dosage building 35A there were 1600/1700 Kg of recovery powder and cellulose nitrate, 800/900 Kg of hunting powder , both in the drying phase, and 180 Kg of cellulose nitrate completely dry, the accident destroyed the building creating a crater with a diameter of 10 meters and 3 meters of depth, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate it;- in the building 22F/G 41 there were 3000 Kg of hunting powder in boxes of antistatic polythene, the fire created by the explosion damaged the building structure.\"To formulate a reliable hypothesis regarding the cause of the explosions, it is needful to consider:- in the unit 10C in the room above the crater there was a conspicuous mass of about 600/700 Kg of deflagrant explosive. The room was covered by reinforced concrete and a thick stratus of ground, vegetation and trees. The next rooms were inaccessible because of unusable opening and covered by vegetation. This material was part of the superfluous war escaped from the reclamation of 1997, as they were confined hermetically in the room;- when the explosion occurred, the dryers 41 and 21N were stopped because the guardian of the establishment had switched off the dryer systems one hour before the accident, intercepting any kind of arriving energy (vapour, electric power). The day of the accident was a no - working day indeed it was Sunday (07/28/2002);- the weighing building 35A was inactive and also when it is working, there isn't any kind of power;- before the first explosion there was a \"whistle\" of about 3/4 seconds.On the basis of the consideration mentioned above, it is impossible that the first explosion was in one of the structures 41, 21N, 22 F/G or 35A, as there wasn't power to generate the explosion of the stored substances.After a study of the ground around the buildings 10C, 41, 21N, 22F/G and 35A we believe that the first explosion was in the room 10C and the others were caused by the incandescent fragments.As concern the type of explosive exploded in the room 10C and his priming, it is possible to formulate some probable hypothesis:Explosive type: The exploded mass was composed by deflagrant explosive not inserted in metal boxes. We may say that because of on the strucures nearby the room 10C there weren't marks of splinter, and the crater had a regular morphology, that means that the explosion was linear. If the mass was formed by mortar bombs it would be very different, because of the many continuity solutions.Priming type:The cellulose nitrate and nitroglycerin propellants, as the probable ones of the accident (like propellants for military rockets, never produced in the establishment), during the time they became old, losing the stabilizer. The main substances of the powder begin a dissociation phase, creating an exothermic oxidation that generates HOT SPOTS in the explosive mass. If the warmth in this HOT SPOTS do not disperse in the mass, it may catch fire, creating burning gas and then it may explode. This kind of event is facilitated when the mass is a confined area, as the examined one.The burning gas whizz created before the explosion in the room 10C, it is the \"whistle\" heard before the deflagration.",
        "Consequences": "The accident destroyed two dryers, a weighing and dosage building of the crude substances utilized for the fabrication of cartridges powders and a reinforced concrete building (from the last world war, unused waiting for demolition).As concern the product losses, 2.9 tonnes of pure cellulose nitrate (dry and humid) and 4.6 tonnes of a mixture of cellulose nitrate and nitroglycerin plus various additives (hunting powders) were involved in the accident.As regards the external damages, the establishment ask to the General Assurance to conduct an analysis, they determine that the explosions generate a shock wave that interested a large area of the Castenaso municipality arriving till Bologna municipality and Granarolo. There were deflections and lesions to the building structures, to the casing and to the furniture.The shock wave created damages without projections of materials from the establishment. Area concerned - Remarks: Concerning the internal establishment area, the interested zone is about 160 meters * 130 meters.\nRegarding the external establishment area, the effects were the ones caused by the shock wave, without projection of materials. \nThe shock wave gone in south direction till 1 Km and towards north till 300/400 meters.People - Remarks:The accident had no effects on people inside or outside the establishment, the total off-site population at risk was calculated in a radius of 2 Km from the explosion point.Material Loss - Remarks:The mentioned costs regarding the establishment losses refer to the strucure damage and to the product loss, but not to the losses caused by the judiciary stop.The costs concerning the off-site losses refer to the requests arrived to the insurance establishment. Community Disruption - Remarks:The municipal road Via del Frullo that border the establishment was closed to the circulation for about 6 hours, to facilitate the assistance means.A political representative began a parliamentary inquiry. ",
        "Emergency response": "The establishment guardian (as part of the IEP staff) gave the alarm after the explosions, advising the internal emergency group and the Fire Brigades of Bologna, they extinguished the fire hotbeds and under the coordination of the internal emergency committee coordinator they did an inspection to verify probably dangerous situations.The emergency ended in to hours.For a detailed description see Emergency measures - Remarks, below. Emergency measures - Remarks: When the accident occurred it was Sunday and the plant was stopped from 12 of Saturday. In the establishment there were only the guardian personnel formed by the guardian (also part of the IEP staff) and his family (2 persons). Outside the establishment there was a person for the grass cut (fire prevention).The establishment guardian (as part of the IEP staff) gave the alarm after the explosions, advising the internal emergency group and the Fire Brigades of Bologna, they extinguished the fire hotbeds and under the coordination of the internal emergency committee coordinator they did an inspection to verify probably dangerous situations.\nIn the establishment arrived also:\nthe Prefect and the Magistrate of Bologna, the majors of Castenaso and Bologna, the Regional Environmental Agency, the Local Sanitary Agency, the Carabineers of Castenaso and the artificer of the Bologna Police.\nAfter an inspection of an expert the magistrature closed the plant, some days later the plant was opened except for the interested area and the impossibility of intervention on the risk ponits ( 2 loaded dryers, the storage deposit of cellulose nitrate and a bury tank with about 20.000 lt of solvents (50.000 lt of capacity).\nWeeks later the dryers were emptied and the explosives stored in the deposits, then the deposit of the the cellulose nitrate was emptied and also the solvent tank (properly drained).\nAfter the reclamation the processing of the semi-finished was ended till the final product to be stored.\nThe operation of put on safety condition the establishment, powder production is still stopped.\nThe monitoring points of the urban traffic do not observe significant change on the polluting agents in reference to the usual condition.\nSubsequently the Regional Environmental Agency of Emilia Romagna did some sampling to verify the presence of amiantus fiber (some destroyed buildings were covered by amiantus), but the result was negative.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Before the accident the\nestablishment presented the SR and the Regional Technical Committee\nevaluate it negatively, asking for integration. This SR didn't have the\nrisk analysis so there weren't accidental scenarios, the probable\noccurrences and the effects.\nThe IEP was presented.\nMoreover the establishment presented the Information Sheet even if it\nwasn't exhaustive. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: The establishment reduced the substances quantities and suspended powders production, they began a study regarding alternatives technological cycles.Measures to prevent recurrence: Considering the hypothesis of the accidental event, they did the reclamation of the establishment except for the interested area that is still confiscated.They found mortar bombs, fuses, empty shells of different calibre destroyed in proper authorized pits from the military staff of the army.The reclamation plan was agreed with the local and central competent authority.The reclamation interested about the 80% of the establishment area, till 3, 4 and 5 meters of depth with a warranty of 4, 5 and 6 meters.Once the confiscated area will be available, a reclamation will interest this part till a depth of 5 meters with a warranty till 6 meters.&nbsp;"

        "Finish Date": "2013-10-06 15:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "At about 16.30, a biogas detection alarm intermittently sounded in the control room of a large urban wastewater treatment plant, and the operator in charge transmitted the alert to the security station. Thinking that the alarm could be due to a problem with the sensor, a security guard equipped with breathing apparatus went to a manhole leading to the underground pipes that feed into the digesters for producing biogas, and confirmed that there was a pocket of biogas beside the sensor and also in two nearby manholes (100% of the lower explosive limit (LEL)). The site duty officer was alerted at 17.30 and, suspecting a leak in an underground pipe, he decided to shut off the sludge mixing booster and to mechanically ventilate the contaminated manhole shafts. The measure was lifted at 18.30 without the leaking pipe having been located, due to the tight network of underground pipes in the area.\nThe investigation was resumed 72 hours later, and measures were taken to reduce the flow of the leak and secure the area during the investigation. This was successful after 60 hours, when a 4 cm hole was discovered at a depth of 4 m in cast-iron piping (DN 400, PS=18 mbar) connecting two of the plant's digesters to the gasholders. 24 000 m\u00b3 of biogas was lost as a result of the leak. Since they could not be shut down, the output of these digesters was reduced by shutting off the mixing, heating and intake of sludge; the biogas zone was sealed off and ventilation was set up near the leak. A sleeve was placed over the leaky section, which was secured until the complete shutdown of the digesters it fed into, and its output (18 500 m\u00b3 of biogas) was progressively released into the atmosphere through the release valves. A segment of the pipe collapsed during the work, rendering repair impossible. The section of pipe was then isolated using a reversible joint of the 'panhandle' type. The biogas network and the station's other digesters were then put back into operation. The two digesters in question were cocooned (with mixing once per week) pending the replacement of the broken section of pipe, causing a production loss of 5% or EUR 160 000.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A hole measuring 4 cm was found at a depth of 4 m in the cast-iron piping (DN 400, PS=18 mbar) connecting two of the plant's digesters to the gasholders. The gradual internal corrosion of the cast-iron piping was the origin of the incident. The biogas released from the digester was very humid near the leak, because the first bleeding takes place after the location of the leak. In addition, the biogas produced in this plant has a higher H2S concentration than that from other sludge digestion plants, because the sludge contains less ferric chloride (which neutralises H2S). Finally, these biogas pipes are among the oldest on the site, and as a result have suffered longer exposure to the corrosive agents in biogas.",
        "Consequences": "Production loss of roughly EUR 160 000.",
        "Emergency response": "The site duty officer was alerted at 17.30 and, suspecting a leak in an underground pipe, he decided to shut off the sludge mixing booster and to mechanically ventilate the contaminated manhole shafts.

        "Finish Date": "1994-03-30 06:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "At the moment of the accident (1h30), 5 employees were present in the plant. A gas boiler and a carbon boiler were on service. The mixed boiler was available for starting up with gas, and the previous team did various vain attempts to start. The message has been transmitted to the night team that try the same to put the boiler in service. An instruction is given by the quarter chief to go and examine the position of the obturator ONIS which allows to block up the main gas circuit.A few before the explosion, an untimely release of gas arrives in the underground, joined probably to the erroneous action of the ONIS obturator by one of the operators. The noise warns the quarter chief, who send another operator in order to locally intervene. The in-service gas boiler is shut down with urgency, and the personnel go out to cut the general supply at the level of the cut off place, 110 m away from the building. At this time the explosion occurs. Warned by the noise, the firemen arrive on place very rapidly, some minutes or more after the explosion. The red plan (help to the victims in large number) is immediately unlatched. 50 vehicles and 200 firemen, arrived from 12 fire-stations, are engaged in the fight and in the rescue. The different ignited fires on site are extinguished without particular difficulty. Various hundreds of C.R.S. men (compagnie republicaine de surete') participate to the fight against the spillage.The extremely rapid guarding (less than 1/2 hour after the explosion) of the businesses which have lost their shop-windows permits to avoid the essential from the thefts.The measurements made by universitary sismographs shows that the dissipated energy on the ground is equivalent to a load of 50 kg of TNT.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Without anticipating the conclusions of the on course judicial inquiry, the available information show that the explosion is probably linked to a gas escape occurred of the feed line of the boilers in the under ground of the plant, at the level of an operculum obturator ONIS installed on the line which supplies the only mixed boiler. This obturator found unlocked and partially open, should have been wrongly operated.The carbon boiler on duty at the moment of the event could not be urgently shut down.It constitutes one of the hot points more susceptible to have generated the explosion.Considered the importance of the network pressure and of leak section represented by this partial opening, it is possible that the power of the gas jet has been sufficient to create a suspension of carbon powder, that could have had two consequences:- the opacity of the local atmosphere could have prevented the operator to&nbsp;&nbsp; successfully intervene on the manual valve close to the leakage point;- the accident could have been created by an explosive mixture of gas and carbon powder gas, the behaviour of this last could have contributed to the violence of the&nbsp; effects.",
        "Consequences": "An operator is killed in the underground, 2 other are seriously injured. The two remaining operators, although shocked, can leave uninjured the building. The destruction of a pavilion situated near the border of the site, 50 m away from the building, causes the death of a little girl, 6 years old, after 4 days. In the vicinity of the site, 56 persons receive injuries of different gravity and are hospitalized for care and observations; other 25 are shocked and receive cares on the place. Finally 250 persons are evacuated from their houses, sheltered in a sportive complex and then temporarily relodged. The district heating plant is ravaged by the explosion: 3 boilers are destroyed, the other and the joined equipments are more or less gravely damaged, the bureaus and  the control room are collapsed. The majority of the slates covering the building is hurled on the ground and the remains of the bardage and thermic isolant are propelled externally to the site. The electro-filters are seriously damaged, but the  chimney doesn't show external dameges. The material damages in the vicinity of the plant are very important: a 3 stories  habitation  building and two trade buildings (one of 5 stories) are very damaged. Damage of various tens of vehicles (cars). About 600 people were put on technical unemployment. In the nearby buildings the glass of the windows have been broken up to a distance of 2-3 km. The average of the recorded oscillations during 6 min gives a lateral displacement of 1 mm at the level of the 23rd story of the seismologic tower. The building of the \"Grande Arche\" is affected with damages on the external structure and on the decoration elements. For safety reasons 3500 civil servants are put in technical unemployment for half a day.

        "Accident Description": "Fire  in a dairy spray drying plant",
        "Causes of the accident": "The most probable cause of the fire were smouldering nests of dust deposits (which may have formed in an unfavourable position inside the tube filter), caused by a spontaneous ignition process or by the shut-down and start-up processes associated with product changes.14/04/1999: a fire occurred in a dairy spray drying plant.About 17:45 h&nbsp; the milk drying process was started up again by the shift manager after changing from milk powder to whey powder.At 19:45 h&nbsp; in the control room a computer display indicated a temperature rise in an exhaust air (gas) filter; simultaneously, the automatic extinguishing system of the exhaust air filter was activated and the plant was shut-down.The temperature alarm is released at 120\u00b0C. The exhaust air filter is designed to operate at maximally 90\u00b0C. At a temperature of 120\u00b0 C, the presence of&nbsp; smouldering nests or incandescent nests in the equipment concerned is assumed.After a short time, due to the smoke plumes emitted by the filter, it was clear that the fire could not be extinguished by the automatic extinguishing system,. Immediately, the manual extinguishing / cooling procedure was started and the fire brigade was alerted. The fire brigade reached the site in five minutes.Due to the installation of a standpipe in the adjacent staircase, the intervention of the fire brigade was immediately effective and the fire was under control after 1 h. Temperatures of approximately 1000\u00b0C developed in the exhaust air filter. In order to avoid a new flare-up, the extinguishing- cooling procedure was continuously repeated until 23:00 h.No personal injuries. Significant material damages were caused. A spreading of the fire in other plant sections was avoided.The dispersion of dust and the consequent explosion did not cause other consequences.",

A leakage causes an alarm signal in the CO-unit.3) All safety relevant faults of the CO-unit are displayed by the program and in the dryer the product feed is switched automatically over to water.4) The correct functioning of the CO-unit is regularly checked from the scrubbing tower by the CO-test-gas feeding system which has also been retrofitted.5) The CO-detection system is monitored by the process control system of the drying plant. The CO- thresholds have been corrected.6) Booster pumps were installed on the extinguishing water pipelines (respectively, on the pipe leading to the spry-dryer tower and to the tube filters) in order to raise the necessary extinguishing pressure. The booster pumps are switched on when the extinguishing system is activated and are connected to the emergency power supply.7) An air compressor, also connected to the emergency power supply, has been installed in order to guarantee the supply of air for the control of the extinguishing water valves.8) Freshwater pumps in the pumping room were connected to the emergency power supply in order to guarantee the supply of freshwater.9) According to the recommendations of the fire department, extinguishing hoses have been installed on every drying plant floor whereas the already existing dry pipe has been connected to the sprinkler system.10) Additional area drains were installed near the tube filter extraction lock of the tube filter&nbsp; in order to improve the drainage capacity of extinguishing water.11) Additional detachable manholes covers were installed as measure for preventing the dust depositions in correspondence of the manholes.The personnel in charge is informed at the release of one of the 3 alert phases and the whole drying plant is inspected according to check lists for eventual deposits or smouldering nests.The already existing maintenance plan of the CO-plant, including also the maintenance service every six months by the plant manufacturer and a 4-week calibration by measurement and control -technicians, has been extended, It integrates now also the above mentioned CO-test-gas feeding&nbsp; system for the functional check of the CO-system.The checklists, the emergency plan, the CO-testing system the calibration are documented in the updated process documentation system.The following safety procedures are maintained:At every product change, an optical inspection of the spray drying plant for powder deposits is performed. During operation the plant will be immediately shut down, inspected and eventual deposits immediately&nbsp; manually removed"

        "Accident Description": "On 10 September 2013, two operators were concluding the filling phase of dimethyl carbonate into reactor R20 of unit RS1 from 200 litre sheet metal drums, using vacuum suction with flexible hose connected to the reactor for the loading phase, up to a total of 849 kg (four whole drums plus a residual fraction of a fifth drum placed on the scales). The product was transferred in an open cycle.\nWhen about 10-15 litres were left in the fourth barrel and the barrel was to be emptied completely, tipping the barrel to provide greater depth, and presumably in the subsequent phase of removal of the filling lance, the dimethyl carbonate vapours in the barrel itself ignited, causing the barrel to explode, the bottom to become detached and the consequent immediate ignition of all the product, with an impact area limited to the sampling point (around two metres). The first operator, who was responsible for handling the flammable products, was hit by burning dimethyl carbonate (presumably a flash fire) and sustained burns to much of his body. He subsequently died after around ten days of hospital treatment. The other operator, supporting the handling operations, fell to the ground a short distance away and suffered bruises and minor burns; he returned to work after 36 days of accident leave.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "It is reasonable to assume that the cause of the ignition was a build-up of electrostatic charge on the hose and the filling lance, both made of plastic. That material, due to its dielectric properties, is not suitable for the handling and movement of the flammable substance, as is stated in the safety sheet for the substance (section 10).\nThe procedure for handling flammable substances that was in force at the time of the event gave general guidance concerning chemical compatibility and earthing of the system, and the proper identification of the specific equipment.\nInterviews conducted with some operators revealed no specific training on handling procedures.",
        "Consequences": "The first operator, who was responsible for handling the flammable products, was hit by burning dimethyl carbonate (presumably a flash fire) and sustained burns to much of his body. He subsequently died after around ten days of hospital treatment.\nThe other operator, supporting the handling operations, fell to the ground a short distance away and suffered bruises and minor burns; having also reported psychological traumas, he returned to work after 36 days of accident leave.\nNo damage to the buildings, equipment or materials present in the unit were recorded.",
        "Emergency response": "At the time of the incident, only the two operators were present in the area concerned.\nIn the initial phase (a few minutes), the shift supervisor and other operators from the unit and the laboratory came running from the upper floor and the ground floor having been attracted by the noise created by the event.\nThe laboratory operators carried out first aid.\nOne of the operators from the quality laboratory responsible for communication proceeded to make the emergency call (112), the call to the health and safety manager and, subsequently, to other members of the management team.\nTwo ambulances, the Carabinieri (police), the fire brigade, and a rapid response car from the local health authority thus attended the scene.\nThe seriously injured operator was taken to a specialist burns unit.\nThe other operator involved received hospital treatment and was then discharged.\nFollowing the events, company staff completed the interrupted operations, with the approval of the authorities present, for the sole purpose of making the reactor safe.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "The company acted quickly to implement and report, in its safety management system, a new version of the procedure for handling flammable substances, which is more explicit about chemical compatibility and earthing the system, and the proper identification of the specific equipment (BGB-ILS-008 rev. B of 16 September 2013, 'Handling and use of flammable raw materials H225 H226 \u2014 R10 and R11 in RS1').\nThe company is currently looking into a new, fixed filling system for flammable raw materials, in a closed cycle and/or a nitrogen atmosphere, from mobile containers, so as to rule out the possibility of inappropriate operations.\nThe Commission points out that the risk related to electrostatic charges when transferring products from small containers tends to be underestimated. In order to limit that risk, specific management measures are essential. It may also be worth considering using closed cycle transfer systems. It would be useful to look closely at these aspects in the context of assessments by the competent authorities and during inspections.\n"

        "Finish Date": "1990-12-10 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Plant description:Facility for chlorination used in the production of 0,0-dimethyl-phosphorochloridothioate (MP-2) and 0,0-diethyl-phosphorochloridothioate (EP-2).A new reactor for production of 0,0-dimethyl-phosphorochloridothioate (MP-2) was used for the first time. Similar equipment was already in use for the same production but the new reactor was microprocessor controlled, especially for controlling the chlorine addition rate and the cooling in order to maintain the process conditions (30\u00b0C and atmospheric pressure) because the chlorination of 0,0-Dimethyl-phosphorodithiotic acid (MP-1) to MP-2 is exothermic.The reaction took place in extraction naphtha (E-60). By-products were thioperoxy-diphosphoric acid tetramethyl ester (MP-11), hydrogen chloride and sulphur.During commissioning, the temperature controller was blocked while testing the microprocessor and the connection was not re-established before starting operation. The production started at noon and the operators did not paid attention to the temperature that was recorded. Owing to a high chlorine addition rate and no cooling, the temperature rose to be in excess of 120\u00b0C about 2 hours after the production started. The solvent (naphta) evaporated and a sudden fast decomposition occurred at 17:55. This resulted in fracture of the rupture disc, in deformation of the reactor lid and in elongation of the bolts of the lid. Flammable gasses were released through the venting system and through the opened reactor lid into process hall. The vapour cloud was ignited when it reached the control room causing an explosion. On the basis of the deformations of the reactor and of the building, Cheminova Agro estimated that the pressure in the reactor reached values of 25-35 bar and that the overpressure in the building reached values of 100-150 mbar. The fire was extinguished by the internal fire brigade assisted by the local fire brigade.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The temperature in the reactor increased beyond 30\u00b0C due to too fast addition of chlorine and lack of cooling. The solvent E-60 evaporated and, when the temperature reached the decomposition value for MP-1, MP-2 and MP-11, a sudden fast decomposition occurred, resulting in deformation, opening of the reactor and then release of flammable gases inside the building and control room. The gases were then ignited and an explosion occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAUSES:Prior to start the production, the temperature sensor was blocked while testing the microprocessor. The connection was not re-established when the computer was used for process control in the production of MP-2. Process temperature was not otherwise supervised by the operators, although the temperature automatically was recorded. Due to the lack of temperature control, a sudden fast decomposition of MP-1, MP-2 and MP-11 occurred, resulting in deformation, opening of the reactor and then release of flammable gases inside the process building and control room. The reactor was equipped with a venting system and a relief pipe provided with a rupture disc but the relief capacity of the system was however insufficient compared to the amount of gases released during the fast decomposition of the substances. The gases were ignited and an explosion occurred. The electrical installations in the control room may have been the source of ignition. Investigations indicate that an explosion took place in the control room and in the opinion of Cheminova initiated the explosion in the process building.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:6 people inside the establishment were injured by the explosion (they were hospitalized but for observation only). The internal fire\nbrigade (20 people) extinguished the fire assisted by the local fire\nbrigade (12 people).

This seriously damaged the tank and caused the death of two staff of the external firm who were present to carry out that work. The work involved the transfer of flammable product (ethyl acetate) from the tank to two other tanks using a vacuum truck. The work was being carried out because it was necessary to use the first tank to store flammable product of the same type but belonging to another client.\nIn the week prior to the accident, the tank had already been emptied of its main contents of inflammable product down to a borderline volume of 14 m3, which is considered to be the \u2018unpumpable\u2019 amount of product that thus had to be removed with a vacuum truck.

        "Finish Date": "2013-08-02 20:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "At 10.15 a.m. on the morning of 25&nbsp;July 2013, a series of explosions occurred in the finished products storage area of a fireworks factory. The initial explosions - three explosions in short succession according to calls from members of the public to the fire service [VVF] - presumably occurred in the vicinity of sheds No&nbsp;4 and 5, which were used to store finished products (fireworks), classified as category&nbsp;IV and V under the National legislation regulating explosive factories and warehouses. Observations of the effects indicate that the sheds probably exploded en masse, i.e. involving all the material contents of the sheds simultaneously. The fire service's findings suggest that, at the time of the explosion, several factory employees - including the manager and two employees related to him, who were killed instantaneously - were loading products from the storage sheds onto vehicles parked nearby. Ignition presumably occurred during the handling of the explosives. It seems that the products being loaded were to be transferred onwards onto vans parked in the yard in front of the entrance gates for shipment to the venues where they would be used, since the vans had been partially loaded but still had to be fully loaded. In the days preceding the accident, the factory had been particularly busy preparing and shipping products for many planned fireworks displays; in particular, a fireworks display for a local festival was planned for the following day. At 10.55 a.m. there was a fourth explosion, in a delayed domino effect, in shed No&nbsp;8, which was used to store up to 9600&nbsp;kg of category IV and V explosive material. The shed, already damaged by the shock wave from the initial explosions, was probably struck by burning debris thrown out by ongoing minor secondary blasts, and it too probably exploded en masse together with all the contents. This last explosion caused the death of a fourth employee (the son of the manager), who was hit by section of the roof of shed No&nbsp;8, and caused serious injuries to a fire-fighter working at the scene, who later died from the injuries. In total, the event caused the death of 4&nbsp;factory employees, serious injuries to a fire-fighter, who died in hospital approximately three months later, and injuries to 3&nbsp;employees and 5&nbsp;fire-fighters, who were all hospitalised and subsequently recovered. The accident caused extensive material damage, with the factory's sheds destroyed almost completely, damage to civilian facilities adjacent to the factory perimeter and related to the factory, and damage to external civilian buildings within a radius of up to 1&nbsp;km. Debris of various sizes from the sheds which exploded was found within a radius of up to 1&nbsp;km. Lastly, the explosions caused environmental damage as they set off a series of large-scale forest fires in the surrounding natural and rural area within a radius of 500&nbsp;m which were later extinguished by the fire service and the State Forestry Corps, deploying two aircraft. The main local authorities (including the Prefecture, the Carabinieri, the police department, the judiciary [judicial inspection] and the local health authority) intervened at the scene. No action was apparently taken by the Regional Planning and Environment Office to measure soil contamination due to chemicals dispersed as a result of the explosions.",
        "Causes of the accident": "In tandem with the MARS inspection, the incident is currently being investigated by the local Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and the official expert [CTU] appointed by the Public Prosecutor is drawing up the official expert report. As part of the judicial investigation, the area of the factory was sealed off and the company documentation on the premises at the time of the event was seized. As a result, although MARS inspectors were able to enter the sealed area (subject to prior authorisation from the PM at the request of the fire service), they have not been able to access the company's documentation. Given the above circumstances, it is only possible to formulate hypotheses on the causes of the accident, based on the information collected and measurements taken after the event by the inspection committee in the course of its inspection and making use of the data provided by several of the public authorities involved in post-accident operations, chiefly the local fire service and the Commander of the Carabinieri. Additional hypotheses have been put forward on the basis of information drawn from the interview with the manager's representative, the appointed expert [CTP], it being impossible to consult either the manager or his employees/family members (who were killed by the explosion). Some surviving relatives are still in a state of shock and receiving psychiatric treatment. The hypothetical conclusions based on post-accident data collected by the fire service and the Carabinieri are set out below. In the process of securing the location after the accident, primed explosive products (already fitted with electric fuses but not connected to a power supply) were found in the factory yard in front of the factory entrance and in the tool shed used as a garage for vans. It was not possible to identify the kind of primers and, consequently, if they were allowed or not inside the plant according with the national regulations. In general, under the national regulations fireworks must never be pre-armed inside the establishment. Considering the material damage sustained by the internal structures, in particular by the sheds with load-bearing walls made from reinforced concrete, and the containment walls, with evidence of disintegration and crushing, the probability is that there was a sympathetic detonation of the explosive material or an instantaneous explosion involving the entire quantity of material due to mechanical stress: this can be compatible with the potential presence in the area of the explosions of quantities of explosive products already, it is assumed, unlawfully primed. It should be added that, according to the statement of the Commander of the Carabinieri, explosive material, including primed material, was also found in the area belonging to the manager's residence and, specifically, in the vans parked in the tool shed and, lastly, fireworks were found in the basement of the tool shed. Considering the above hypotheses, it is possible to suppose that the operating procedures deployed by the company were unsafe, as also supported by the conclusions of a previous SMS inspection conducted by local Authority in 2012, which pointed out the absence of adequate operative procedures and instructions for managing the explosives production in safe conditions, in each stage of process. This aspect goes beyond the lack of information and training provided to operators who, as experts in the field may be deemed to be well aware of the dangers of handling primed materials; it suggests, rather, an excessive level of \u2018confidence\u2019 gained over time and perhaps overfamiliarity with work involving materials that in fact entail a high level of intrinsic risk. To this may be added the probable situation of working under pressure, subject to constraints of time and space, in the days immediately preceding the event on account of the many orders for firework displays which the operators themselves were called upon to carry out by virtue of their acknowledged reputation in the sector. Furthermore, given the extent of the material damage sustained by external structures impacted by debris from the disintegration of the sheds and protective walls, and based on a damage assessment by applying the TNT equivalent method to the case in point, considering the maximum quantity authorised within a shed, it may be hypothesised that the quantity of explosive in the stores at the time of the event exceeded the quantity permitted by the competent authority. Applying the above method with a highly conservative approximation of the case leads to the conclusion that the structural damage due to the pressure wave compatible with that observed on the outside buildings damaged ought to lie within a radius of less than 107&nbsp;m; however, damage of this kind (lifting of the building's wooden roof, cornerstone movement, curtain wall damage, partition wall damage) were found at a radius of between 100&nbsp;m and 500&nbsp;m from the craters made by the explosions. Furthermore, on the subject of the quantity of explosives in stock, according to information reported by the Commander of the Carabinieri approximately 20&nbsp;days after the event (13&nbsp;August) some 0.2 tonnes of black powder were found stored in five drums in an abandoned hut outside the factory adjacent to the southern perimeter. There were no labels on the drums. This amount, together with the 0.43 tons found in shed No&nbsp;2 following the explosion, would exceed the authorised limit of 0.5 tonnes for black powder. Lastly, we should stress the domino effect of the initial explosions upon shed No&nbsp;8, first hit by the shock wave and then ignited, presumably by burning debris. In theory, compliance with National Regulations with regard to the distances between sheds should have prevented a domino effect of this kind but only if the authorised maximum quantities and types of explosives were also respected. These considerations again point to the root cause being the breach of safety requirements in terms of the quantity and type of explosive material authorised and/or stored and processed in the establishment. This is supported by the conclusions of the incident report drawn up by the local fire service, which managed the emergency response to the event. On the basis of information obtained from interviews with surviving relatives not currently in a psychological condition to have dealings with the inspection committee, the appointed expert [CTP] representing the manager reports that the operator was regularly asked to store (Authority request) quantities of explosive material entrusted to its legal custody after being confiscated by the police. This material,may be, in general, not well identified and consequently with an unknown (and potentially dangerous) behaviour, was stored in the sheds together with explosive products manufactured by the company. In particular, at the time of the accident, the appointed expert [CTP] reports that the stores held a quantity of confiscated explosive material roughly equivalent to 6 or 7&nbsp;tons, in storage sheds No&nbsp;4 and No&nbsp;5 (where the initial series of explosions was found to have occurred). So the appointed expert [CTP] declares that the origin of explosions is probably attributable to the chemical decomposition of explosive material delivered into the company's legal custody by the police, stored in sheds No&nbsp;4 and No&nbsp;5 together with the company's own finished products. He therefore highlights the critical significance of the storage of unidentified confiscated explosive material which, as it loses chemical stability over time, presents an increased risk of explosive decomposition.",
        "Consequences": "The accident caused extensive human, property and environmental damage: Human damages occurred within the establishment, comprising the instant death of 3&nbsp;members of staff (including the manager) hit by the first series of explosions, the instantaneous death of a fourth member of staff (the manager's son) who had returned to to the establishment to look for his missing father and was struck by debris ejected from the fourth explosion, serious injuries suffered by a fire-fighter hit by the fourth explosion who died in hospital three months later, and injuries sustained by 3&nbsp;employees and 5&nbsp;fire-fighters participating in the emergency response. Material damage occurred both inside and outside the factory premises, comprising, internally, the total destruction of almost all the sheds and damage to civilian structures related to the factory and, externally, damage to certain civilian structures (residences, church, cemetery, farm tourism structures) caused by the pressure wave up to a radius of 500&nbsp;m and by the ejection of debris up to a radius of 1&nbsp;km. Environmental damage occurred outside the factory premises, comprising the destruction of forested and agricultural areas up to a radius of approximately 500&nbsp;m from the establishment, extending to a total area of approximately 70&nbsp;hectares as a result of fires ignited by the explosions. In addition, again downstream of the explosions, chemical products (flammable and oxidising) used for mixes that had been kept in sheds No 6 and No 7 were dispersed over an area of outside land adjacent to the enclosure on the south and east sides. Immediately after the last explosion, a mushroom cloud of combustion gases approximately 50&nbsp;m high was observed.",
        "Emergency response": "Considering the dynamics of the accident, the effects, and the information provided by the firefighters teams involved in the emergency procedure, it is possible to say that the internal emergency plan was not really activated, and the external emergency was not adequately and quickly requested by the company. Firefighters were called first only by the citizens of surrounding towns, after seeing and hearing explosion effects. In fact, the local firefighters chief reported that it received one call from a survivor component of the company only after 8 calls of citizens. Moreover, after the first explosions, the missing evacuation of the surviving operators inside the plant led to increase the damages.",
        "Lesson Learned": "On the basis of information collected and the reconstruction of the hypothetical chain of events , even though the judicial investigation into the accident is still under way, it is possible to point out the following shortcomings in management: it is possible to suppose that the operating procedures deployed by the company were unsafe, as also supported by the conclusions of a previous SMS inspection conducted by local Authority in 2012, which pointed out the absence of adequate operative procedures and instructions for managing the explosives production in safe conditions, in each stage of process; beyond the lack of information and training provided to operators, who as experts in the field may be deemed to be well aware of the dangers of handling primed materials, an excessive level of \u2018confidence\u2019, gained over time and perhaps overfamiliarity with work, involving high level of intrinsic risk materials, came out; given the extent of the material damage sustained by external structures impacted by debris from the disintegration of the sheds and protective walls, and based on a damage assessment by applying the TNT equivalent method to the case in point, it may be hypothesized that the quantity of explosive in the stores at the time of the event exceeded the quantity permitted by the competent authorities. This leads to the hypothesis of a breach of safety requirements with regard to the maximum quantities of dangerous substances kept in store and processed; it should be stressed that the safety distances laid down in the National regulations are valid and upheld only if obligations stemming from them and from safety requirements and safety procedures are also systematically complied with; attention should be drawn to the company's deficient in-house management of the emergency, including its failure to call in the emergency services in good time and failure to detect situations requiring the immediate evacuation of the premises: the failure to evacuate staff from the premises after the initial explosions aggravated the damage caused; as for the damage caused by the ejection of debris, attention should be drawn to the lethal effect of the pieces produced by the break up of the roof of shed No&nbsp;8 which, thanks to their strong but thin metal structure (sandwich panels), when ejected at high speed following the shock wave acted like sharp blades, thus causing the death of one employee. Consequently, the technical issue of the construction features of the roofs on the sheds, also raised in discussions with a police bomb expert, should be noted: although this type of roof is adequate in terms of providing protection and a preferential vent for a shed containing explosive material, it may aggravate the effects of an explosion in the shed in which it is broken into fragments; with regard to the difficulty of emergency service and fire service action during the explosions, it is noted that the presence of a second access route to the works, on the opposite side to the first access route, would have facilitated the positioning of fire-fighting equipment and the management of the emergency response and would significantly have reduced the fire-fighting team's risk of exposure to the shock wave and material debris during the operation. In this connection, the effective coordination of the team, with the fire-fighting units positioned and arranged in such a way as to take advantage the protection offered by the variations in altitude of the terrain on which the sheds were located, and the team's use of PPE (safety helmets, etc.) undoubtedly prevented the situation becoming more costly in terms of damage suffered by the fire-fighters."

Following the failure of a rod that centrally controlled the fuel gas butterfly valves on the heating flues, mixed gas flowed uncontrolled into some of the heating flues. The mixed gas got into the heating flue exhaust system, where it exploded.Following the explosion, the entire coke oven battery automatically entered safe mode, i.e. the quick-closing valves on the fuel gas feed were closed immediately.\nThe explosion was accompanied by a loud bang and a visible emission of dust. There were no injuries. The on-site fire service and the local fire brigade attended the scene and secured the area. There was no danger to local residents.\nThe exact cause of the failure of the rod is not known at present.\n\u2013 Automatic safe mode;\u2013 Interruption of the fuel gas feed by closing the feed.",

        "Accident Description": "Police investigations as well as in-house investigations supported by the relevant professional body ruled out an electrical fault, access by third parties or atmospheric impacts as triggers.\nAn expert assessment has since also ruled out a causal link between the electrical installation and the fire.\nBased on the facts, the operator assumes that the spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose (NC) material cannot be ruled out as a chemically possible cause.This must have resulted in a fire in the storage chamber, which then transformed into a deflagration reaction.The deflagration reaction from the gunpowder blew off the roof of the warehouse bunker, designed to act as a decompression area.\nFragments from the building and the warehouse were scattered over a radius of up to around 50&nbsp;m. Individual projected items were discovered around 100&nbsp;m away in the industrial area.\nSafety functions:The impact remained within the legally defined hazard range and the pre-calculated protection and safety margin.\nAccording to in-house and police investigations, after the reaction the affected area posed no entry hazard. Apart from the area\u2019s temporary closure, no urgent security action was required.The following measures could not have impacted on the incident itself.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The complete destruction of the building and facilities meant that the investigation had to be conducted by process of elimination (see triggers/process).\nSpontaneous combustion of nitrocellulose (NC) material.",
        "Consequences": "A storage building was destroyed, another suffered damage to its roller shutters and sections of wall, and there were glass breakages in several farm buildings.\nThree instances of glass breakages were reported from a neighbouring locality.\nSoil contamination in the immediate vicinity. No lasting/long-term damage expected.Concrete bunker sole, walls and roof pierced. Earth covering of the building and ejected non-combusted stored goods deposited in the immediate vicinity.\nThree instances of glass breakages reported from a neighbouring locality.",
        "Emergency response": "\nFollowing the reaction, the entire vicinity was sealed off over a wide area and an investigation conducted while applying appropriate protective measures (armoured vehicle, protective clothing, drone flight). In consultation with the police, the danger zone was delimited and eventually all areas made safe to enter.\nThe plant\u2019s fire service and the regular fire service, in cooperation with the police, sealed off and secured the area and provided fire protection.\nThe plant\u2019s fire service extinguished wildfires in the immediate vicinity.\nOn the day of the accident, initially all operations were stopped completely. The early shift was stood down; the late shift resumed operations.\nThe affected area is situated on premises protected by a double fence and under electronic surveillance. No further precautionary action was required.\nThe area outside the operational area was initially secured by the police. Following the inspection, this area was deemed safe to enter and re-opened.\nIn consultation with the police, on the day of the accident the area surrounding the storage building was cleared of recoverable materials, particularly intact packaging, but also significant quantities of exposed propellant charges and other components. The material was secured for further investigations.\n\n\nA decision on reconstruction is pending.\nSheeting etc. was used to protect glass breakages. Repairs were carried out by specialist firms.\nGlass breakages reported by nearby residents will be reimbursed.\nDamage to buildings was assessed by construction engineers.\n\n\nEjected material was salvaged and collected.\nThe site was explored and assessed for soil contamination.\nAn evacuation plan was drawn up and adapted.\n\nLocal fire service:Support from the plant\u2019s fire service with securing the site.\nPolice:Protection against unauthorised access.Inspection and re-opening of the areas for investigators.Inspection and re-opening of public areas.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nCompany staff immediately checked the functioning and condition of electrical equipment in all storage buildings.\nNo defects were identified.\n\n\nAll storage buildings had their electrical equipment checked by an expert in electrical engineering, lightning protection and building code law. No defects were identified.\n\n\nAfter an initial tour of the accident site to assess the buildings, all other storage buildings are now undergoing structural surveys. An initial on-site response verified the structures and, in particular, function of the decompression areas. The report is pending.\n\n\nTechnical possibilities are being examined for enabling similar incidents to be detected in advance. As conventional fire detection technology cannot be used due to the material properties and dynamics of the process, permanent monitoring of the internal chamber is being tested. The use of thermography or thermal imaging cameras has had to be abandoned in the meantime. Plans for remote optical and electronic monitoring are currently being developed.\n\n\nAnalytical checks on the samples recovered after the incident and corresponding comparative samples revealed no signs of instability or other anomalies. However, the storage period is seen as an influencing factor. Plans for the analytical/chemical monitoring of stock are therefore being drawn up as a potential means of addressing the root cause. In addition, computerised processes have been introduced to facilitate stock control and disposal.\nIn this context, extensive re-evaluations have already been carried out and large quantities of stock transferred for disposal.\n\n\nThe key factor in the scenario considered here is the combining of nitrocellulose, a material capable of spontaneous combustion, with gunpowder, a thermal material in which a quasi-detonative reaction can be induced. In future, material capable of spontaneous combustion (e.g. nitrocellulose), particularly if it is not used in construction, will be separated from material in which thermal excitation can cause a very rapid deflagration or even a detonative reaction within the meaning of storage category 1.1 (mass detonation). In the case of materials used in construction, a decision should be taken on a case-by-case basis according to the revised storage category and the item\u2019s properties. Appropriate assessments and relocation on site have already been carried out.\n\nOn-site:\n\nPrimarily, the impact can be limited by adapting storage quantities to the local conditions. These are based on the legal requirements for protection and safety distances and will be complied with. There will be a periodic review as part of the updating of safety analysis and safety reporting in accordance with the St\u00f6rfallverordnung, the mechanism under German law for regulating incidents.\nGlass breakages on site premises will be further reduced by applying protective film to panes, preventing possible injuries to staff.\nThe construction of additional earth banks or protective walls was examined but does not seem appropriate in the current situation.\n\nOff-site:\n\nWhen the deflagration occurred in the storage building, smaller, relatively lightweight projection hazards (cardboard, sheeting, etc.) were thrown over the fence up to around 20&nbsp;m into the adjacent forest area. The trees between the warehouse and the fence had been thinned out due to parasite infestation. New planting took place.\nIn order to be able to further exclude risks to third parties, negotiations began on the purchase of the adjacent forest area to the south. A land-swap agreement is now in place. Formal implementation is pending. The area will be enclosed and the forest path running through it moved.\n"

The resulting fire in this area damaged a hydraulic line, which further intensified the fire. At the same time, the mould overflowed and the content of the tundish flowed onto the casting platform. This caused a second explosion, the cause of which is not known.\nThe hydraulic system automatically cut out because the minimum tank level had been reached.

However, it is likely that it came from a wet gunning mix, possibly water vapour from the heating process that had condensed in the pores of the repair compound.\nIt would however appear that the water had been stored in the pores of the repair compound which was found under the splash core.\nAs the trailing steel referred to above came into contact with the stored water, there was suddenly enough energy available for evaporation and the explosion occurred approximately 12 minutes after casting.",

Within 20 minutes the fire propagated to the 3 units belonging to the operator, via the roof and the existing openings in the walls. The partial collapse of a dividing wall made of breeze blocks allows the propagation of the fire to crop protection products and to animal foods stock belonging to a logistics company associated to the operator. The smoke affected 37 members of the fire brigade, 7 of whom were hospitalised under observation. The extinguishing water (1,500 m3), contaminated with fertilisers and herbicides, detergents, and soaps, collected in a non-hermetic storm basin, threatening to pollute some drinking water catchments.Requisitioning measures were taken to ensure quick drainage and storage of the contaminated water for later treatment. The fire was put under control about 2 hours after its start. The building was partly preserved due to the means deployed by the emergency response services.",
        "Causes of the accident": "On 1 August 2000, an initial fire occurred around 11:30 in the bales of cellulose watting stored in one of the cells, which is used by one of the tenants as a workshop for the production of paper for sanitary use, cloths and napkins. This fire is a consequence of works carried out with welding torches on the roof of the building.The accident may have been caused by human error, i.e. an error of the workers on the roof, or by an inadequate preparation of the works by the building's owners, or by both factors. The exact causes are unknown.",
        "Consequences": "The smoke affected 37 members of the fire brigade, 7 of whom were hospitalised under observation. Approximately 1,500 m# of the extinguishing water collected in a non-hermetic storm basin downstream from the site threatening to pollute the water table and some drinking water catchments of Marly-La-Ville.The earth of the reservoir has to be classified as polluted and the rainwater network is tainted. The stored products damaged by the fire were still being kept in the cells at the time of this report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding solutions for the treatment of the polluted waters constituted one major consequence of the accident. Besides the high costs of the operations, legal and administrative procedures had to be engaged, and the treatment of the polluted water had to be scheduled over a period of 11 months.On 4th August 2000 the Prefect of Val d'Oise requested the operators responsible for the products involved in the fire to dispose of the extinguishing water collected in the Marly-La-Ville storm basin within 24 hours. Faced with the refusal of the 2 operators, the Prefect issued a requisitioning order on 5th August 2000 under the terms of the Acts of July 22nd 1987 and July 11th 1938 concerning:- the requisitioning of pumping and transport equipment of a specialised company;- the requisitioning of facilities needed to store the extinguishing water until treatment, consisting in the leaching tank of the Asni&egrave;re-sur-Oise treatment plant (800 m#) and the aeration tank of a class 2 technical burial centre (700 m#);- the monitoring of the water table by setting up 2 piezometers downstream the nearby drinking water catchment station.The treatment cost of the polluted water is estimated between 1.07 and 1.2 M euros (1.070.000 and 1.200.000 euros)and is mainly due to the equipment immobilisation cost of the requisitioned companies.",
        "Emergency response": "Some employees used fire fighting hoses from the on-site fire-fighting equipment against the fire. Within 20 minutes the fire propagated to the 3 units belonging to the operator, via the roof and the existing openings in the walls. The partial collapse of a dividing wall made of breeze blocks allowed&nbsp; the propagation of the fire to crop protection products and to animal foods stock belonging to a logistics company associated to the operator.

The fire was put under control about 2 hours after its start. The building was partly preserved due to the means deployed by the emergency response services.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The rapid spread of the fire to a cell occupied by a third party shows that it is important to verify the applicability of construction regulations and adapt them to the specific conditions of the site. The presence of arsenic derivatives in amounts above the thresholds defined in the SEVESO Directive makes the monitoring of the inventory and its risk assessment mandatory.The pollution of the storm drain threatening the water table justifies the need for a hermetic extinguishing water retention pond. Each operator should construct a retention basin or each category of activity should at least have a retention pond at its disposal.In this specific case of a platform operated by different companies, responsibilities were difficult to determine and this caused a significant delay in implementing measures intended for an efficient emergency response.Law suits and administrative recourse have significantly complicated and slowed down the resolution of the pollution problem."

        "Accident Description": "In the morning hours, the worker was asked to fill up a poliethylene container (IBC type, capacity of 1 m3) with a nitric acid. The smaller quantities of acid were used to correct the reaction and the amount of carbonates in the chemical mixture. Essential quantities of nitric acid (as raw material) are being pumped to the reactors from the storage tanks. The worker loaded an empty container on a fork-lift truck and drove to the storage tanks located 200 m from the installation. After filling the container and screwing the cap, the tank started to bulge. The worker slightly unscrewed the cap which brought back the normal shape to the container. The worker repeated this activity twice while transporting the container. Then the container was put on a ground in the production hall/room (a place where potassium nitrate was produced). At 9:20 a.m. the container bursted causing release of the acid. The room started being filled with vapours and nitric oxides. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "The analysis showed that the container used was not designed for acids. The worker (by mistake and not obeying the instruction) took the wrong container. The properly labeled container was left inside the hall/room. The container which was used contained some residual quantities of hydrogen peroxide. During filling operation with nitric acid a reaction occurred resulting in formation of gases which caused the pressure increase inside the tank (bulging of the container's walls). The investigation revealed that: - the container ruptured/bursted along whole length one of its bottom edges (between side wall and bottom),\n- the side walls were dented towards inside,\n- the container frame (made of steel pipes) was dented towards outside.",
        "Consequences": "Seven workers felt bad so were taken to the hospital for examination. There were released home after 3 days of hospitalization. Nobody was burned by the acid.\nNo damage to the environment reported. The majority of the released acid flowed to the holding tank (installed in the ground). The material damage was estimated on several hundreds of Euro. The production was resumed at 10:00 p.m. and was preceded with the analysis of the concentration of N2O in the air.",
        "Emergency response": "The rescue actions performed by the external units included the following activities:- evacuation of 30 workers present in the room/hall and the the close vicinity. - localization of the leakage location,- neutralization and sorption of the acid,- performance of the measures of the acid's concentration,- establishment of the dangerous zone,- ventilation of the rooms,- protection of the place where accident occurred.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In order to prevent recurrence the following activities have been taken:- for the storage of acid, the containers designed for 60% concentration can only be used including their proper labeling and actual legal proofs,- transport of the containers with acid can only be carried out when supervised by the worker leading the shift. - the instructions and procedures connected with different operations like: loading, distribution, storage and internal transport have been updated,- training of the workers.The operator was obliged to update the Major Accident Prevention Policy and to get acquainted all of the workers with it. The operator fulfilled this obligation."

When changing the filter cartridge, the side of the filter in question is deactivated by means of a shift lever. In the belief that the lever was in the correct position, the side of the filter through which the oil flowed was accidentally opened for a maintenance procedure (sealing a leak in the filter housing).The turbine oil which immediately escaped in a wide stream soon ignited on the hot surface of the steam turbine, which was at a temperature of approximately 380&nbsp;\u00b0C. The resulting oil fire spread to the main cable routes running near the steam turbine.\nSafety measures:Emergency stop activated and on-site fire brigade alerted via fire detection system; professional fire brigade alerted via security centre.

No further action is needed outside the operating area.\n\nA chemical assessment of building and fire damage was immediately undertaken, including sample-taking and analysis and the defining of health and safety measures.\nCleaning by a specialist firm and supervision of cleaning by experts.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Fires in turbine oil systems, whether in steam or in gas turbine plants, frequently occur and often result in high levels of material damage. The combination of turbine oil, which is essential for the lubrication of the turbine bearings, and very hot surfaces in the immediate vicinity may result in a fire in the event of an \u2013 ultimately sometimes unavoidable \u2013 leak.The likelihood of a turbine oil fire such as this can be reduced by a combination of the following precautions and measures:The particular and rare combination of an ammonia-cooling plant with a steam turbine drive gives rise to fire hazards which are not covered by TRAS&nbsp;110 (Technische Regeln f\u00fcr Anlagensicherheit \u2013 technical rules for plant safety). Additional fire protection requirements therefore have to be met.\nIn the hazard analysis for \u2018external leakage\u2019, the possibility of the leaked turbine oil igniting on contact with the hot surfaces of the steam turbine must be considered and the following countermeasures laid down:\n\nTurbine oil leakage monitoring systemsThese consist, for example, of a continuous check of the level of oil in the oil container and monitoring of any rapid reduction of the level.In addition, collection trays in the area of the oil pumps and turbines, for example, might be fitted with leak monitoring (level detection switches).\nFire protection switchesFire protection switches should be installed in the central control room, in the area of the steam turbine and along the escape routes. When activated, these trigger the rapid shutdown of the turbine and switch off all auxiliary oil pumps once the turbine has stopped operating.\nConstructive fire prevention measuresThe turbine oil systems \u2013 in particular the main oil filter and the control oil filter which caused this incident \u2013 must, as far as possible, be located separately from the steam turbine.Steam pipes must be carefully insulated and cladded.It should be checked whether the building\u2019s retention of substances hazardous to water can be designed in such a way that if there is burning turbine oil, it does not result in under-burning of the steam turbine or plant components which carry ammonia.\nFine spray extinguishing systemAccording to the literature [HDI&nbsp;2016], stationary spray extinguishing systems have proved successful in the case of turbine oil fires in steam turbines. In such systems, the turbine, the oil container and the other oil-carrying parts are provided with a large number of fine spray nozzles which spray water when triggered by an automatic fire detection system (UV detection, heat and smoke detection and in some cases multi-criteria detectors).The advantages of these spray extinguishing systems are the comparatively small quantities of firefighting water and the uniform distribution over the plant to be protected.\n"

        "Accident Description": "An explosive fire took place in the melt shop of a factory in Tornio.&nbsp; A main valve of oxygen gas pipeline broke at Avesta Polarit's Tornio melt shop line number 2 on the 19th of September 2003. The accident caused an explosive fire, which was extinguished within half an hour. The accident took the lives of three peoples.&nbsp; No-one was injured. The melt shop was in an annual maintenance shutdown and control work was being done on valves on the oxygen distribution pipeline. Main pipeline runs from the exterior of the building to the melt shop. The back-pressure valves had been changed and the testing of the system was starting up. The accident investigation has been carried out by the national Accident Investigation Board and TUKES. Accident Case HistoryA fierce fire costing the lives of three workers took place at the Tornio (Finland) steelworks of AvestaPolarit Stainless Oy on September 19, 2003. The accident site was the melting shop of the steelworks. The melting shop line number 2 that had been built the previous year was in its first annual maintenance shutdown. During the shutdown back pressure valves were to be installed to pipelines conveying the so called raw oxygen and pure oxygen. Therefore they had been closed and made purged by air. Most of the work had already been completed, and the foreman of the factory and the foreman of the subcontractor started preparing thestart-up of the oxygen systems.The men entered the valve room on the third floor of the melting house, where they successfully opened the main shut valve of the raw oxygen line. Thereafter they started opening the main shut valve of the oxygen line. The valve was apparently stuck, because the bolt pin holding the hand wheel in the valve stem snapped. The men asked for pipe tongs, with the help of which they started turning the valve hand wheel stem. They managed to turn the stem about one turn, corresponding to a 9\u00b0 turn of the disc. At that moment an explosive fire broke out. It kept burning fiercely as the oxygen was leaking from the damaged piping. Both the foremen that had been opening the valve and a welder who had come to the scene by chance were killed.Judging by the burn marks the fire started from the oxygen line main shut valve; a butterfly valve with a nominal diameter of 300 mm. Gaseous oxygen compressed to a pressure of 35 bar was flowing in the pipes. There was a by-pass line beside the valve. Due to safety reasons this line was supposed to be used to equalize the pressure on both sides of the main shut valve before opening the latter. After the accident the by-pass valve was found to be in a closed position, although no specific information about the use of the by-pass line was found in the investigation. Whether or not the by-pass line was used will have affected the cause of the fire.",
        "Causes of the accident": "On the basis of the investigation the fire may have ignited in three different ways:1) The slide bearings of the valve disc stem may have been damaged, and two steel surfaces may have come into contact in the damaged area. When the valve was being opened, these two surfaces may have become hot by the friction and set fire to the plastic bearing material which ignites more easily than steel.2) The valve may have been opened without equalising the pressure. In this case the dust particles from pipeline in the fast oxygen flow of the valve gap would have struck valve parts, become hot, and ignited the valve to burn in the oxygen. 3) A foreign object may have got stuck in the valve and formed a friction pair that caused friction heating when the valve was being opened. The third option is possible even though the by-pass line had been used, but the first two necessitate the opening of the valve without equalising the pressure.",
        "Consequences": "Three workers died in the accident. One of the fatalities was the foreman of the factory, one the foreman of the subcontractor and third fatality was a subcontractors welder, who had come to the scene just before the accident. They were killed immediately.The fire was extinguished relatively quickly as the flow of oxygen was closed down and the fire brigade commenced fire-fighting activities. The success of fire damage limitation was due to fire containment compartments and non-flammable roof structures. Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "The factory's own fire-brigade, the municipal fire brigade of the city and municipal fire-brigade from a neighbouring city in Sweden. Official action taken - other official action: The company had to provide clarification in the three following phases for the Safety Technology Authority of Finland (TUKES):1) Clarification of the immediate actions which the company has taken to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future (1.10.2004). The clarification had to pay particular attention to the operational safety of oxygen valves and pipelines.2) In the second phase (31.1.2005) the establishment had to provide clarification for TUKES on how it has improved the contents and scope of instructions concerning the operation and maintenance of oxygen equipment and how the company will ensure functionality and compliance with the instructions. In this clarification the company had to describe the procedures by which the personnel's knowledge of risk and working methods would be improved. In addition, widespread competence and expertise in the case of oxygen system changes had to be described.3) When the safety report is next updated, the company should identify and present possible accident scenarios pertaining to the oxygen system. The extent and severity of the consequences should also be described as well as the protective measures and intervention required to limit these consequences.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: In order to prevent similar accidents the accident investigation group set up by the Safety Technology Authority (TUKES) made the following suggestions: 1.Skills, commitment and responsibility related to dangerous substances and safety should be emphasised and effectively developed.&nbsp; 2.Safety of valves used in oxygen systems should be confirmed as correct and in good working order. When making alterations or modifications, dependable equipment suppliers must be used. The company should define design and safety requirements for the oxygen systems and in addition, design instructions which should be observed in the design of oxygen systems. &nbsp;3.Clear and extensive written instructions for the use, control and maintenance of the pipelines must be made, and they have to be available to anyone needing them. Any deviations from normal operations should be reported and dealt with in detail.&nbsp; 4.When oxygen lines are put into operation, purity of the pipeline surfaces exposed to the oxygen atmosphere is an absolute prerequisite, which must be adhered to at all phases of construction and installation. The minimum amount of cleaning, inspection and testing procedures to be carried out on the oxygen systems shall be defined in writing.&nbsp; "

        "Causes of the accident": "Materials used for the acid polishing plant (low pressure polypropylene).The probable cause of the fire are the materials used for the acid\npolishing plant (low pressure polypropylene). This material liquefies\nwhen heated, releasing vapours which are highly flammable. When using\nwater to fight the fire, the polypropylene swims on the extinguishing\nwater like oil, propagating the fire.\nThis swimming caused the burning polypropylene to reach a cellar room,\nwhere it caused a propagation of the fire.\nThanks to the refrigeration of the acid tank and to a windowless\nfirewall between the acid storage site and the acid polishing unit, a\nsulphuric acid tank and a hydrofluoric acid tank were not damaged. A\nsilicic acid tank, also made of polypropylene, was deformed but no\nleaks occurred.\nThis event caused material damage for approx. 12500000 EURO. (twelve\nmillion five hundred thousand EURO). The acid polishing burned down\ncompletely.\nEnvironmental damages were caused by acid extinguishing water flowing\nfor a short time receiving stream Consequences: ca. 100 dead fishes\nCost: approx.. 5000 EURO (five thousand EURO).",

Welding sparks ignited flammable vapour escaping from an open-ended pipe about four feet away from the contractors' welding activity. The explosion killed 3 workers and seriously injured a fourth one.The accident has been investigated by the US Chemical Safety Board&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "Contract workers had to weld a pipe between two storage tanks. They removed the hatch at the base of one of the tanks, and entered to remove the crude oil residue. They flushed the tank with fresh water and allowed hydrocarbon vapor to evaporate for several days. On the day of the accident, one worker inserted a lit oxy-acetylene welding torch into the hatch and then into the open nozzle on the opposite side of the tank to verify that all flammable vapor had been removed before welding, which is clearly an unsafe practice. The workers laid a ladder on the tank roof, extending it across the 4 feet space between the two tanks. Almost immediately after the welding operation started, flammable hydrocarbon vapor venting from the open-ended pipe attached to the second tank ignited. The fire spread through the overflow connecting pipe from the second tank to a third one, which exploded. The lids of both tanks were blown off.Several unsafe work practices contributed to the fatalities and injuries in this case, including:- A gas detector was not used to test for flammable vapor.- Flashing tanks containing hydrocarbons with a lit oxy-acetylene torch to determine the presence of flammable vapour is unsafe and extremely dangerous.- The open pipe on the adjacent tank was not capped or otherwise isolated.- A makeshift work platform-a ladder placed between the tanks-was used.- All tanks were interconnected and some of the tanks contained flammable residue and crude oil.",
        "Consequences": "3 workers standing on top of the tanks were thrown by the force of the explosion, fell to the ground and died. A fourth worker was thrown off the ladder, but he was wearing a safety harness that prevented him from falling to the ground.",
        "Emergency response": "Volunteers from the local fire department and personnel from the county sheriff's office quickly responded to the incident site following an eyewitness' emergency call. Emergency medical technicians provided first aid to the victims. Two victims died at the scene, a third victime died while being transported to the hospital.",
        "Lesson Learned": "- The company did not use available guidelines for hot work safety.- Available training and guidance offered by trade associations and member organizations should be used in the oil and gas service industry.- The company should develop and implement written procedures to ensure safe work practices during hot work, tank cleaning and work at elevated locations. This would have assisted workers in identifying and eliminating hazards prior to beginning the welding operation."

Description of the situation prior to the accident:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.1.2006 - technology shutdown of HCN and cyanide production. At the time the AKH production was not in operation, DPG production was in normal operation as was the pumping of wastewater from the hydraulic barrier. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only wastewater from the DPG and hydraulic barrier was lead to the WWTP - detoxication sump. In order to clean the equipment on 8.1.2006 the cyanide production equipment remained shutdown. Once the WWTP (chemical) container was filled, the wastewater was pumped to the WWTP - detoxication sump for further treatment. Monitoring of the detoxication sump is done both by a floating gauge that signals that the sump is full and by visual inspection by service staff. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night shift 8/9.1.2006 - according to the staff working on the night shift no variation from the normal operation was noted after shutting down the HCN and cyanide production. During the night the temperature dropped from approx. 13\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C. Due to the fact that water leaking during shutdown of production is much more concentrated, pretreatment was performed on detoxication sump 3 which was unsuccessful. A responsible staff member was made aware of this by telephone at approx 11 o'clock pm. He decided to fill the sump and that treatment would be performed on the morning shift. In the second half of the shift no employees were working in the vicinity of the sumps neither were the sumps visually inspected. Employees left the plant at 6 o'clock am.2. Temporal course of the accident in the area of the WWTP - detoxication sump at LZD and subsequent action taken:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.1.2006 the detoxication sump WWTP was found to be completely full in the early hours; a responsible employee determined that there was no overflow from the sump. Responsible employee who filled the sump took these immediate measures:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conformity with the working instruction PI 1201-16-02; point 5.1 (deviation from the normal technological regime) a submerged pump was used to pump the content of sump 3 (full sump) to sump 2 to reduce its volume.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The equipment was checked to determine why there was no signal that the sump was full. It was determined that the floating signal gauge was frozen (due to the low temperatures during the night). The indicator of the gauge was freed manually and the gauge immediately began to operate with no problem.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concentration of the discharged water was checked and found not to exceed the limit values.After taking these measures he checked the other parts of the WWTP and chemical WWTP. On his return he realized that the pump hose was pulled out of the side of the sump. On first inspection no water was flowing from the hose and nothing indicated that any water had escaped from the sump. Therefore he did not evaluate the situation at this time as an accident and did not report anything to his superiors. This information only came to light in his statement dated 10.2.2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.1.2006 (in the early hours) - service staff at the Podebrady and Nymburk dams informed the water management control center of the Labe river catchment authorities of considerable fish fatalities near the hydraulic power station. The police, CIZP, and the local fishery unions in Podebrady and Nymburk were informed immediately. Analysis of the dead fish determined an accidental degradation of water quality caused by an unknown material, which was subsequently determined to be total cyanide.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.1.2006 (Friday) - CIZP performed an inspection at LZD in order to determine the possibility of a release of cyanide. After a local investigation they determined that the presence of cyanide in the Labe could have originated at LZD. The CIZP hypothesis stated that most probably an overflow of the detoxication sump occurred and water was released through the company's sewerage system to the Labe.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.1.2006 (Monday) - an internal committee was set up to determine:\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not the ecological accident was caused by contaminated water from LZD\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual cause of the accident\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The temporal course of the accident\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective remedial measures4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.1.2006 - technical equipment was inspected at the WWTP - detoxication sump to determine the possible cause of the accident. From the first information given by staff on the morning shift it was determined that during the change of shifts on 9.1. detoxication sump 3 was found to be completely full whereby they pumped part of the contents and that they subsequently found the signal gauge to be frozen and fixed this problem. There was no mention at this stage that the pump hose was found beside the sump. Based on this information the floating signal gauge was checked and was taken into consideration during the investigation of the occurrence and causes of the accident, and relevant remedial measures were taken i.e. increase in frequency of physical inspection in the area of discharge of wastewater from LZD.&nbsp; 5. 16.1.2006 - CIZP performed another inspection where further details of the accident came to light including the measures taken to avoid a repeat of the accident. 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.1.2006 - considering the local investigation performed together with CIZP and the information given by staff of the morning shift the Commission stated that on the 9.1.2006 there was most probably an accident at LZD involving a release of an undefined volume of discharge water to the Labe. 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.1-17.12006 - based on point 6 remediation of the surroundings of the WWTP - detoxication sump was performed including measures to limit release to the sewerage system. 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.1.2006 - LZD presented its statement at a press conference that based on internal investigation and the conclusion of CIZP an accident occurred on 9.1.2006 which led to the release of wastewater with an undefined content of cyanide to the Labe.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.1.2006 - LZD announced a major accident pursuant to Article 15 paragraph 2 of Act 353/1999 Coll. to the relevant state administration within the legal deadline (i.e. within 24 hours of determining an accident occurred).10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19.1.2006 - first negotiations between LZD and the local fishery unions on compensation for damages caused by the accident.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.1.2006 - a report was submitted to CIZP on remedial measures to be taken and their deadlines for elaboration. 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23.1.2006 - internal guidelines (organization regulations) were issued at LZD to improve controls and record keeping of the discharge of wastewater and to establish further measures to be taken to solve issues of wastewater discharge at LZD.13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;24.1.2006 - Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. was commissioned to elaborate an expert opinion on the situation and the possible causes of the malfunction of the floating signalization gauge.14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26.1.2006 - Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. submits his expert opinion to LZD.15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27.1.2006 - CIZP issued a report on the fulfillment of remedial measures set by CIZP.16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;27.1.2006 - CIZP issued with the expert opinion on the malfunction of the floating signalization gauge.17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27.1.2006 - meeting between LZD and the Labe River Catchment Authority at which the accident was reviewed and proposals for further steps to be taken and cooperation between the two bodies were made.18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31.1.2006 - LZD and the fisheries sign an agreement of financial compensation for losses caused by the accident.19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27.1.2006 - 16.2.2006 - based on the conclusions of Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. and the information on total cyanide contamination in the river (taken from Labe River Catchment Authority reports) it was determined that the malfunction of the gauge could not be the only cause of the accident. For this reason and based on further investigation, the internal Committee came to the conclusion that human error was to some extent involved in the accident.20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.2.2006 - internal investigation with staff members of energy production and in particular those who were preset on the night and morning shifts prior to and during the accident. This resulted in the opinions of individual employees on the course of the shifts prior to and during the accident. In particular Mr. Charamzy (WWTP - sump service staff member), Mr. Krutsky (WWTP - sump supervisor) and Mr. Soukup (head of energy production). 21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.2.2006 - on the basis of the results of the internal investigation the general manager was informed of the possible causes of the accident by an internal memo which stated that several human errors occurred during the accident, including:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor did not correctly evaluate the state of the detoxication sumps during the night shift or organize the activity of the service staff,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor acted carelessly during pumping of the detoxication sump,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor poorly evaluated the situation&nbsp; from the point of view of the possible release of toxic water and accident occurrence and did not inform his subordinates,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor did not divulge all of the facts important in determining the causes of the accident during the first internal investigation.22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21.2.2006 - LZD informed the public at a press conference that based on the internal investigation it was determined that other than the technical malfunction, human error was also to blame for the accident.3. Remedial measures taken after discovery of accident:The following measures were taken at LZD after the accident of 9.1.2006 (adopted in cooperation with CIZP):Immediate measures taken after determining the accident:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rainwater sewerage system was shut down in the area of the WWTP - detoxication sump and the sewerage system was temporarily insulated with a VAPO pneumatic filling. When the climatic conditions improve the outlet will be concreted. Concreting was performed in the second half of 2006.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signalization system was improved with doubling the amount of floating signalization gauges-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical checks of the working of the floating signalization gauges at the beginning of each shift change were initiated.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expert opinion on the analysis of the state of the signalization gauge in sump 3 was commissioned with emphasis on the possible technical malfunction on 9.1.2006.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequency of visual checks on filling of detoxication sumps increased to once per hour at least for each sump.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above-ground supply pipes were checked for integrity of joints.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pump hoses were changed and an overall inspection of pumps used in the WWTP - detoxication sump was performed.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequency of analyses of discharged wastewater from LZD outlets increased, specifically for presence of cyanide min. once every 2 hours on specific objects. -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system for control and recording of wastewater discharge from the detoxication sumps was changed. New internal guideline OP VR 13 - 06 - \"control of discharged wastewater from the detoxication sump WWTP\" was elaborated, which sets the scope and method of record keeping of wastewater discharge, in particular it sets the responsibility for responsible people to give signed permission for the discharge of the sumps.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Training and testing of all service staff of the detoxication sumps on their knowledge of internal technological guidelines related to their employment was performed.The following measures were not taken immediately or could not be taken immediately:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rapid construction of new chemical-biological WWTP with deadline to be in pilot operation 31.10.2006 at the latest.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluation of the current capacity of the WWTP - detoxication sumps-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issuing of internal memo to inform all employees of set limits for wastewater discharge from LZD for CN- tox and CN- total.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directive of the general manager issued at the managerial meeting 23.1.2006, \"During non-standard behavior of technology or disposal of waste of any type limit or completely stop production and together with relevant responsible person determine the situation\".In order to fulfill the long-term and short-term measures the following tasks were accepted in the minutes from operational meeting no. 4 dated 23.1.2006:- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verify production technology in areas where a release of hazardous compounds to the environment may occur and up-date or change documentation in order to reduce the volume o hazardous compounds and the risk of release &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deadline for fulfillment of task: 30.6.2006&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Completion: task is completed, responsible person ing.

These will be made known when complete by responsible members of the management without delay. The results of the administrative procedures will be made known to the employees in the local press. - During non-standard behavior of technology or disposal of waste of any type limit or completely stop production and together with relevant responsible person determine the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deadline for completing task:&nbsp; constantCompletion of task: task fulfilled constantly, the relevant employees are fully informed.4. Evaluation of the actions of LZD employees during the accident, verification of operative processes of employees and their compliance with the law and LZD internal guidelines:Description of the WWTP - detoxication sumpWastewater from the production of AKH and DPG are lead to the detoxication sump from the hydraulic barrier and wastewater with a high content of CN ions for rinsing of cyanide production equipment. Under normal operational conditions the following average daily volumes are lead to the WWTP - detoxication sumps:from DPG production &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 - 120 m3from AKH production and HCN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30 - 35&nbsp; m3from Hydraulic barrier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 - 15&nbsp; m3Wastewater from the production of HCN and NaCN are lead to the chemical WWTP, which treats water with high content of CN ions. Toxic water in the WWTP-detoxication sump usually has toxic levels ranging in the hundreds of mg CN-/l.The total capacity of the detoxication sumps under normal operational conditions is 250 m3 (40% of which is suspension). This volume guarantees sufficient wastewater containment for detoxication. In exceptional cases (malfunction of the striper, malfunction in the production of cyanide, shut down of HCN or cyanide production) the WWTP-detoxication sump is used for disposal of wastewater from the cyanide production or HCN. This wastewater is more toxic with values can range in the thousands of mg CN-/l. The volume of wastewater that can be lead to the detoxication-WWTP is given by the method of treatment and retention of the individual apparatus for the production of HCN and cyanide, and ranges in (max.) tens of m3.Description of the activities of service staff at the WWTP - detoxication sumpThe internal guidelines PI 1201-16-02 \"Detoxication sump\" and TR 1201-04-02&nbsp; \"Detoxication sump\" were issued for operation of the technology. Employees are made familiarly with theses internal guidelines which are constantly made available and are obliged to follow them. Wastewater discharge is recorded on the form \"summery of pumped sumps, volumes of wastewater and consumption of raw materials\". The detoxication process and results of analytical evaluation are written on the operational sheet \"Detoxication sump (pumping, treatment)\". Apart from during the main shift, analytical evaluation is performed at the weekends and during unmanned shifts by the water management laboratories at LZD. During the main shift analytical evaluation is performed during inter-operational controls. The results are recorded in the relevant laboratory logs and on the operation sheet \"Detoxication sump (pumping, treatment)\". Technological regulation in Chapter 7.1. Deviations from the normal technological regime includes the procedure during treatment and discharge of wastewater for possible very alkaline water, large volumes of cyanide ions and in the case that the wastewater can no be treated using the standard methods. In this case it is permitted to pump the wastewater over a longer period of time in order to reach the required limit concentrations. The values of contamination in the discharged wastewater from the LZD site in indicator CN ions (toxic and total) are set by a valid permit issued by the relevant water management authority, which is the environmental and agriculture department of the regional office of the central Bohemian region. The permit was issued 17.8.2004 and is valid to 31.12.2006.Values for wastewater discharged from the LZD site are as follows:- CNtox&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 mg/l- CNtotal&nbsp; 10 mg/l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All activities were performed by the service staff during the accident of the 9.1.2006 according to the above-mentioned technological documentation. The only error of the service staff was to not secure the pumping hose and to not pay adequate attention during pumping. On the other hand though, the WWTP - detoxication sump is not an area that is permanently manned i.e. staff members perform other duties in conformity with their work responsibilities, the WWTP - detoxication sump therefore is not constantly manned.Another error of service staff was to not inform superiors or investigators of the accident of the hose that was pulled out and lying on the edge of the sump.5. Conclusion:On the basis of the internal investigation of committee the following conclusions have been made:The accident of 9.1.2006 occurred due to several factors. The low temperatures had a negative effect on the formation of nontoxic forms of cyanide and on the floating signalization gauge.&nbsp; This however was not the main cause of the accident. The Commission states that the service staff of the WWTP - detoxication sump in essence acted in conformity with valid internal guidelines, even though the accident occurred, whose cause was the carelessness of service staff, and in particular:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; insufficient securing or no securing at all of pump hose during pumping wastewater from sump 3 to sump 2. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carelessness during pumping of wastewater from sump 3 to sump 2, and not discovering that the pump hose on the edge of the sump was extracted, which was most probably the cause of the release of toxic wastewater to the company's sewerage system and subsequently to the Labe.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not informing subordinates of the extracted pump hose on the edge of the sump, and subsequently not informing management during the investigation of the accident.Criminal responsibility of service staff flowing from the above mentioned errors is in the full competence of the authorities acting in legal procedures.After evaluating the adopted measures, both immediate and subsequent, the Commission states that the scope of these measures was and is adequate for the occurrence of an emergency situation and that all measures are duly fulfilled.Done in Kolin 31.3.2006Signatures of Committee Members:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ing.

        "Accident Description": "Hot oil at high temperature leaked from a corroded pipeline in an energy central and formed a hot oil gascloud which was ignited. The fire did not spread to the neighbouring plant that handled flammable liquids. The energy central was constructed as a separate fire cell. The fire was extinguished after 2 hours. The energy central suffered total damage.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Leakage caused by corrosion in an insulated hot-oil pipe operating at temperatures in the range of 300 degrees Celsius. Pipelines with hot-oil operating at these temperatures are not know to corrode. The corrosion did not occur in an elbow, but in a straight part of the pipeline.&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "The energy central was totally burnt out, and is expected to be out of operation until spring 2022. This also affects the alkyd emulsion producton. Two persons got minor injuries in connection with the emergency response.&nbsp;",
        "Emergency response": "The fire detection system detected the fire. Local fire brigade, police and ambulance were alerted and arrived 8 minutes later. Internal emergency personnel and crisis management team were activated. The fire was extinguished after 2 hours.\nAn automatic foam system in the energy central did not activate automatically because it had been bridged during installation of new fire detectors in the plant. Attempted manual activation of the system was unsuccessful because the wiring was destroyed in the fire. The water supply was challenged due to the need of cooling water for the emergency shut down of plants, the internal fire engine did not start due to a defect battery.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Many lessons learned, some of them are:\n\nUnclear responsibilities regarding installation of new fire detectors\nInsulated hot-oil pipes operating av 300 degrees Celsius can corrode even if that is believed not to be tha case. Routines for visual control under insulation are imortant.\nWiring for important emergency equipment must be better protected against fire&nbsp;\nMOC-processes must define clear responsibilities regarding:\n\nfor which activities a MOC-process is neccessary\nstart up after a modification.\n\n\n"

        "Accident Title": "Leak of phenol to the municipal sewer",
        "Start Date": "2008-01-05 00:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "2008-01-08 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "On Saturday January 5th 2008 a production operator discovered a fair-sized phenol leak in the phenol pump house next to the phenol storage tank. One of the gaskets on the flange connection on the outlet pipe of the tank had failed. The head of the operations department tried to stop the leak by tying a rubber belt around the flanges. In the meantime, an operator sprayed lots of water on the flange to avoid contact with phenol as much as possible.The phenol that had leaked was collected in the catchment pit of 20 m# underneath the pump house. Afterwards the spray water was added to it. This catchment pit had a high level alarm, but that was not functioning at the time of the leak. The malfunctioning was not known by the company at that time because the alarm wasn't inspected periodically. An attempt was made to close the only manual valve on the pipe, located between the inner and the outer tank shells. But the valve broke off during this manipulation. So the line couldn't be shut off. After the temporary repair of the flange connection, three trickles of phenol kept on spraying, which were also collected in the catchment tank. It wasn't allowed for the employees to enter the pump house for as long as the phenol was leaking.To clean up the catchment pit, the company disposes of a waste tank, which is big enough to contain all leaked and leaking phenol. When starting to pump the phenol from the catchment tank to the waste tank, it was discovered that the catchment pit did overflow. Part of the phenol/water mixture had flown over the rim of the open pit into the municipal sewer system. At the time, it was not yet known how much phenol had leaked to the sewer system.On Monday January 7th 2008 it was decided to start up the phenol based batch production to consume all phenol in the storage tank as the phenol tank had to be taken out of service in order to replace the gasket on the flange. On Tuesday January 8th, after a few batch productions, it was found out that the level indicator in the phenol storage tank got stuck since the last control of the level on Friday 4th (comparison of manual level measurement with level indicator). Only at that moment the company realised how much phenol had leaked out of the tank: about 25 tonnes! Most of it should have been collected in the catchment pit, so it was recuperated. But a part of the phenol, more than 5 tonnes, got in the municipal sewer. As far as is known, there was no external damage reported.A specialised company came on site to repair the (remaining) phenol leak with a temporary, but solid solution. Afterwards, when the flanges and valves were replaced, it was found out that the valve broke down because the gasket next to it had been reacting with phenol during many years, leading to a solid deformation preventing the valve to move.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Degradation of gasket.\nFailure to implement a successful inspection and maintenance programme.Summary of what went wrong: - The gasket of the flange was leaking. This wasn't noticed immediately. This gasket had been installed about 18 years ago, when the tank was built. This gasket wasn't (full) phenolproof. - The manual valve at the tank broke off as a result of the deformation of the adjacent gaskets. Since the day the phenol tank was taken into service, this valve had never been closed or inspected.- The automatic activation of the submerged pump by a level switch in the catchment tank didn't function. This level switch had never been tested in the past.- The level indicator in the phenol tank didn't function anymore. This malfunctioning can only be a recent fact because of the frequent control of the indicator. A few days before the incident the indicator was still working properly.",
        "Consequences": "25 ton of phenol in catchment pit\nof which 5 ton overflowed in the public sewer.Affected Area: installation&nbsp;",
        "Emergency response": "Only leak repair",
        "Lesson Learned": "Lessons learned:- Set up a risk based inspection system. During earlier visits Seveso inspectors diagnosed a insufficient inspection system. Although some work was already done to select a better system, by the time of the phenol leak, this new inspection system wasn't completely in place yet.- Replace the gaskets more frequently. The used gasket was a \"Vitton\" gasket. According to the supplier data, Vitton gaskets are phenol-resistant, but the facts prove that after many years the gaskets aren't phenolproof anymore.- Better design of the manual valve (outside of the cup tank instead of between the 2 shells).- Better working procedures (closing the manual valve after each run of phenol based production batches or at the end of the working week)"

        "Accident Description": "ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Direction&nbsp; of&nbsp; wind: West. Atmospheric Stability Class: D. Wind speed = 2m/sec (data given by the company).The accident occurred between 11:40 and 11:50 a.m. at the upper level of the building at the pesticide plant, in the water-bath used for pre-heating barrels of raw materials. The pre-heating at 40\u00f650oC of the contents of the barrels was carried out by means of hot water, which in turn was directly heated by steam supplied by a steam coil (the coil diameter was 5 cm whilst the diameter of the holes of the coil was 0.5 cm). According to the standard operating procedures, the operator had to be always present in the installation and to control the temperature of the raw material. The temperature control had to be carried out by checking the water temperature by means of a hand thermometer and by switching-off the steam valve. The heating of the water was allowed for a period of 2\u00f62.5 hours as maximum, since long operating experience had shown that this period of time was sufficient to reach a raw material temperature of about 40oC. The day of the accident dimethoate (14 barrels each containing 124 Kg of material) and parathion-methyl (6 barrels each containing 260 Kg of material) had to be heated. Despite of the standard operating instructions, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve of the line heating up the water of the bath. Thus, the heating time of the water of the bath and the barrels was extended for at least one hour. As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels containing dimethoate. As a result of the explosion (probably due to the friction between the caps and the bodies of the barrels), a fire of dimethoate occurred with subsequent emission of NOx, SOx and mercaptans. The fire was then followed by the detonation of the caps in other six barrels containing dimethoate. In order to avoid pollution of sea water by fire fighting extinguishing water (because its flow rate was too high and the pump which had to send it to the main waste water treatment plsnt was not adequate), the overflow was trapped in a pool made out of gypsum and limestone. It is under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the wastewater treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or if it was partly released to the sea. The plant halted working on 16 of January and started again to work on March of the same year, after the replacement of the water-bath by a new one.&nbsp;It is under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the waste water treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or if it was partly released to the sea.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nThe overheating of the water-bath caused the detonation of the caps in three barrels (each containing 125 kg of dimethoate) and afterwards a fire. The fire was then followed by the detonation of the caps of other six barrels containing dimethoate.\n\nCAUSES:\nWhen the Original Report was prepared, the accident was under juridical investigation. At that moment, the current analysis of causes was the following:\nAccording to the process specification and to the standard operating procedures, the pre-heating of the dimethoate was carried out in the water-bath at 40 - 50 degrees Celsius with a residence time of 2 - 2.5 hours. Despite of the standard operating instructions, the operator forgot to switch-off the valve of the steam heating up the water of the bath, thus extending residence / heating time for at least one hour. As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels.Further uninvestigation revealed that:Despite of the standard operating instructions for the pre-heating of dimethoate, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve (codes 5303 and 5401) heating up the water of the bath and the overpressure, due to the vapours produced in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels (code 5102). The plant design and process analysis were inadequate because the heating of the water bath was carried out directly with steam and not with hot water (codes 5307 and 5308).",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:According the dispersion model developped by the Laboratory of Physics of the Environment of a University, the combustion products of dimethoate reached (for SOx) a maximum concentration of 1.75 mg/mc at a distance of 100 metres from the water-bath (the maximum permissible concentration in the working environment is 5.32 mg/mc). Blood tests were carried out for the plant operators (dimethoate reduces the cholinesterase in the blood) but no effects were detected.MATERIAL LOSS:The cost of the material losses caused by the accident (damages to the water bath, the cables of the fan and loose of the contents of 20 barrels) has been estimated at 16,000 Euros.ECOLOGICAL HARM:When the Original Report was prepared. It was under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the wastewater treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or was partly released to the sea.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of:       Ecological component: marine or fresh water habitat - Affected Yes",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire was extinguished in 10 minutes by 10 people working in the company. As the fire was extinguished, three fire cars with 15 firemen from the Fire Brigade arrived and helped the personnel of the company. EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Local authority was immediately notified as well as environmental and other authorities. In order to avoid pollution of sea water by fire fighting extinguishing water, since its flow rate was too high and the pump which had to send it to the main waste water treatment plant was not adequate, the overflow was trapped in a pool made out of gypsum and limestone.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident the following measures were established:\n1- the heating system of the water-bath was replaced by a new one whereby steam is heating water in a closed circuit and hot water is used to heat the water in the water-bath via a heat-exchanger. Both systems are controlled against high temperature by special systems which do not allow the water temperature in the bath to exceed the required temperature;\n2- the barrels during  placing in the water-bath have to be protected so that they do not come into contact with heat-exchanger tubes;\n3- the water in the water-bath is recycled to obtain homogeneous degree of heating.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, a new system was installed to ensure that, in case of fire, the extinguishing water is collected and safely neutralized.Useful references: According to the dispersion model developped by the Laboratory of Physics of the Environment of the University of Thessalonikiand taking into account the amount involved in the accident and the meteorological data, the combustion products of dimethoate reached a maximum concentration (for SOx) of 1.75 mg/mc at a distance of 100 metres from the installation (the maximum permissible concentration of SOx in the working environment is about 5.32 mg/mc)."

        "Accident Description": "A serious&nbsp; hydrocarbon release took place at 9.45 am when an oven on the steam-cracking line of a chemical site was started-up after maintenance work (decoking); 6 t of a gaseous mix containing 5% benzene and 3% butadiene were released into the atmosphere for 30 min. The onsite contingency plan was activated.The odours were perceived several kilometres from the platform.&nbsp; Several dozen local residents and employees of the company felt unwell or experienced eye irritation; the personnel of a neighbouring company (200 people) were confined&nbsp; in a shelter. About fifty employees of the installation were given urinary tests fordetecting biological signs of exposure to benzene.Oily fallout mixed with rain was also observed in a nearby town, along with irisation due to traces of hydrocarbons on vehicles. The operator will pay the cost of cleaning any equipment affected (170 vehicles and 30 homes), representing a cost of 100,000 to 500,000 euros. The operating losses have been estimated at 0.5 to 2 million euros (9 days shut-down). &nbsp;The transition stage between decoking and starting-up the oven requires 2 valves to be operated: closing one of them to permit the release of decoking gases into the atmosphere after going through a cyclone, and opening the other valve to send cracking gases to the oil quenching column downstream. At the time of the accident, a mechanical problem prevented closure of the first valve, which was not detected by the computer or the personnel. Under these conditions, the valve between the oven and the quenching column was open, leading to the emission of 6 t of cracked gas from the oil quenching sector into the atmosphere. The gas emission via the 41 m high flare lasted 25 min until the valve between the oven and the quenching column was closed manually (automatic closure impossible).The operator's fault analysis revealed a failure of the coupling between the electric motor and the shaft of the decoking valve. In addition, the limit switch design (electric type) based on detection of the number of rotations of the motor organ rather than on the physical position of the valve shaft, made it impossible to detect the fact that the valve was not closed.The operator's fault analysis revealed a failure of the coupling between the electric motor and the shaft of the decoking valve. In addition, the limit switch design (electric type) based on detection of the number of rotations of the motor organ rather than on the physical position of the valve shaft, made it impossible to detect the fact that the valve was not closed.Several improvements were made before the oven was brought back into service: a new valve was installed (design changed), another device to detect the physical position of the shaft of the valves was added and the limit switches were integrated into the existing safety sequence, an accident report was prepared and the personnel were reminded of the instructions for inverting these valves and the points requiring vigilance. Lastly, experts examined the valve between the oven and the quenching column that could not be electrically operated during the accident. The competent authorities and elected officials in France and Germany were advised.This accident was notified under point 2 of Appendix 6 of the Seveso II directive due to its useful technical lessons.This accident is characterized on the European accident gravity scale:- at level 3 for hazardous materials released (2 t of extremely flammable substances released representing 4% of the Seveso threshold),- at level 2 for human and social consequences (8 employees slightly injured),- at level 3 for economic consequences (0.5 to 2 million euros operating losses and 0.25 million EUR offsite material damage)",
        "Causes of the accident": "The operator's fault analysis revealed a failure of the coupling between the electric motor and the shaft of the decoking valve. In addition, the limit switch design (electric type) based on detection of the number of rotations of the motor organ rather than on the physical position of the valve shaft, made it impossible to detect the fact that the valve was not closed.The transition stage between decoking and restarting the oven requires 2 valves to be operated: closing one of them to permit the release of decoking gases into the atmosphere after going through a cyclone, and opening the other valve to send cracking gases to the oil quenching column downstream. At the time of the accident, a mechanical problem prevented closure of the first valve, which was not detected by the automatic control system or the personnel.",
        "Consequences": "Odours were perceived several kilometres from the platform.&nbsp; Several dozen local residents and employees of the company felt unwell or experienced eye irritation; the personnel of a neighbouring company (200 people) were confined&nbsp; in a shelter. About fifty employees of the installation were given urinary tests for detecting biological signs of exposure to benzene.Oily fallout mixed with rain was also observed in a nearby town, along with irisation due to traces of hydrocarbons on vehicles. The operator will pay the cost of cleaning any equipment affected (170 vehicles and 30 homes), representing a cost of 100,000 to 500,000 euros. The operating losses have been estimated at 0.5 to 2 million EUR (9 days shut-down). ",
        "Emergency response": "The internal contingency plan was activated. The gas emission via the 41 m high flare lasted 25 min until the valve between the oven and the quenching column was closed manually (automatic closure impossible).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Several improvements were made before the oven was brought back into service: a new valve was installed (design changed), another device to detect the physical position of the shaft of the valves was added and the limit switches were integrated into the existing safety sequence, an accident report was prepared and the personnel were reminded of the instructions for inverting these valves and the points requiring vigilance. Lastly, experts examined the valve between the oven and the quenching device that could not be electrically operated during the accident."

        "Finish Date": "1986-03-15 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Hydrogen peroxide was used in a pharmaceutical industry to deodorize an aqueous chemical effluent containing various strong smelling sulphur compounds. The stainless steel treatment vessel was connected to a cast iron holding receiver by both top and bottom connections. The liquid was transferred by the bottom connection and any foam generated during the treatment vented back to the receiver using the top connection. When the treatment method was first adopted, foam had escaped out of the open man lid in the treatment vessel. The man lid was therefore sealed. The foam then passed up the vent system and contaminated the scrubber system. Hence the modification to vent the foam into the receiver. The treatment method for the effluent was provided by the firm's parent company which was specialized in hydrogen peroxide chemistry. The method used was first to add hydrogen peroxide (35%) and then caustic soda solution (25%) to bring the pH up to approximately 9. On some occasions foaming occurred. Management did not fully investigate these incidents; some of the operators were aware of a pressure rise in the treatment vessel if the caustic solution was added too quickly. On a cold Saturday morning in March an explosion occurred within the plant. The lid of the stainless steel vessel was blown off whilst the cast iron receiver was blown to pieces. A process operator nearby at the time was killed. A fire, producing an acidic smoke, then very rapidly spread through the entire building.Research followed the accident showed that the foaming was caused by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, catalyzed by the sulphur compounds in the effluent. The decomposition reaction is also pH-dependent. At about pH=7.5, a rapid exothermic decomposition takes place. The heat produced is capable of vaporizing the various aliphatic alcohols also present in the effluent, producing a potential explosive mixture. This mixture would have filled the head space in the treatment vessel and then spilled into the empty receiver. The source ignition was not fully identified though static or spontaneous ignition could be involved. The bursting discs failed in relief vent lines but from the Original Report it is not fully clear if was a component malfunction or a wrong design. After the accident occurred, the factory had to be demolished.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENTS AND CONSEQUENCES:An ignition in vessel caused an explosion followed by a serious fire. Ignition was caused by either (a) static discharge in relief vent line or (b) auto ignition of alcohols vapours-hydrogen peroxide in vessel-receiver.&nbsp;&nbsp; CAUSES:The management did not fully investigate the formation of foaming. Researches following the accident showed that the foaming was caused by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. This decomposition was catalysed by sulphur compounds in the effluent and was also pH dependent. At about 7.5 pH a rapid exothermic decomposition takes place. This reaction was not identified during the process analysis of the\ndeodorization of aqueous organic chemical effluent. The management did not fully investigate the formation of foaming.  The heat produced is capable of vaporizing the various aliphatic alcohols also present in the effluent. This produced a potentially explosive mixture. This mixture would have filled the head space in the treatment vessel and then spilled into the empty receiver. When the Original Report was prepared, the ignition source was not fully identified though static or spontaneous ignition could be involved. The bursting discs failed in relief the vent lines.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:1 person (a process operator nearby the deodorization unit) within the establishment was killed by the explosion.MATERIAL LOSS:The effects of the explosion were contained within the building. The building, containing a multipurpose plant (with reactors, receivers, filters, tanks and assorted services) was engulfed by the fire following the explosion. No data are available about the cost of the damage.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:Local residents were warned to close the doors and the windows because of the acidic smoke produced by the fire.The explosion effects were contained within the building. Though local residents were warned to close doors and windows because of acidic smoke produced by the fire, in the Original Report there is no evidence of significant effects outside the establishment.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Evacuation of site personnel. Fire fighting operations were carried out and cooling water was sprayed onto nearby storage tanks.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Closure of nearby main road. Local residents were warned to close doors and windows because of acidic smoke produced by the fire.No emergency measured are still required, neither on-site nor off-site.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- the unit to be demolished;\n2- process producing the chemical effluent containing strong-smelling sulphur compounds transferred to another factory;\n3- a new process for effluent treatment not using hydrogen peroxide to be introduced."

Considering the fact that the pump had been substituted 2 weeks before, it is assumed, that the threaded joint had not been tightened correctly.",
        "Consequences": "Material damage onsite: - Soil contamination with rinsing liquid containing chrome trioxyde in the courtyard of the company in correspondence to the discharge point of the building. - Contamination in the ground floor - Broken pump,. Material damage offsite: - Contaminated sewage sludge - Disposal of the contaminate sludge as hazardous waste ",
        "Emergency response": "Safety functions: safety measures were started by the company's personnel after detection of the leakage.The manual sewage system slide valves have to be closed by the personnel or the emergency response services in case of an emergency. The slide valves are designed to retain extinguishing water and not to retain&nbsp; leaked products in accordance to the requirements of the fire department. In any case the sliding valves could not have retained the leakage of the rinsing liquid containing chrome trioxide into the sewage system, due to the fact that until now failures of the plant could only be detected through the regular inspections rounds, because there was no direct emergency communication system between the plant with the SPS control system of the continuously manned central galvanisation line. When the leakage was detected the chrome trioxide containing rinsing liquid had already leaked into the sewage system.Emergency response measure: Protective measures: - By the personnel:-&nbsp; the safety manger of the company and the fire brigade were alerted following the procedures foreseen by the emergency response plan- interruption of the spillage flow from the building in the courtyard by strewing chemical binders - sealing of the gullies- reduction of the chrome trioxyde with sodium bisulphite;Material damage repaired:- Excavation of contaminated soil in the courtyard&nbsp;- repair of the damaged plantEnvironmental remediation:- Excavation of contaminated soil in the courtyard- Protective measures by external emergency response services:- Information of the sewage treatment plant concerned- Reduction of the chrome trioxyde with sodium bisulphite in the rain water retention pond, used as puffer storage.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:- Installation of a pressure control device on the pressure side of the circulation pump - Installation of a leak detection probe in the collection tub-Installation of a second automatic valve in the fresh water feeding system. The existing valve and the newly installed valve will shut off automatically when the pressure control system and/or the leak control probe trigger.- Protection of the pump with a Spray guard- Patrolling during first shift with event recording- Installation of a second pump, used uniquely for dosing the rinsing liquid to be integrated into the chrome baths, in addition to the existing circulation pump.

        "Accident Description": "At the time of the serious accident, the concerned phosgene production unit was out of service, under vacuum, and contained no phosgene. In the meantime, phosgene production was in progress in other similar units. The concerned unit was connected to the ongoing phosgene production through a pipeline. That pipeline connection was blocked with a paddle blind, that had been placed between the flanges under the remote-operated pneumatic ball valve.\nBy management's decision, the paddle blind had to be removed. The task was carried out by a system operator and a trainee system operator (later became victim), supervised by the shift supervisor.&nbsp;\nBefore the work, they checked that the unit was under vacuum, and no phosgene was present. After loosening the bolts connecting the flanges, the paddle blind could only be partially removed, it was stuck between the flanges.&nbsp;\nWhile he tried to remove the stuck paddle blind without a proper tool, the trainee system operator unintentionally displaced a test screw on the&nbsp;remote-operated pneumatic valve and opened it partially.&nbsp;This resulted in a phosgene release.\nThe trainee system operator used an air-purifying respirator instead of the required compressed air breathing apparatus. The toxic gas immediately got through the filter of the air-purifying respirator, causing the trainee system operator to inhale, also contaminate his workwear.&nbsp;\nThey immediately rushed to the control room, where the shift supervisor instructed the system operators to shut down the technology.&nbsp;\nAfterward, the shift supervisor checked the status of this pneumatic ball valve on the PLC screen.&nbsp; It displayed failure while receiving a closing command.\nThe trainee system operator, apart from coughing, appeared to be in a good condition. Also, he verified that he is not feeling unwell.\nAt the establishment, there was a 7/24 emergency service (local firefighter brigade and first aid service). In the control room, the system operators and the shift supervisor questioned the trainee system operator if he needed first aid, but he did not request it, so they did not notify the emergency service.\nBy the end of the shift (at 23:00) and on his way home, the trainee system operator was feeling better. Soon after arriving home, however, his condition deteriorated significantly. The shift supervisor pick him up and took him to the hospital. After a medical examination, he was admitted to the intensive care unit, where he died in the early hours of the morning.\n&nbsp;",

This could have caused the accidental movement that opened the valve.\nFurther, indirect causes of the release:&nbsp;\n\nresponsibility for ordering and carrying out maintenance tasks was not clearly defined,\nthe victim, as a trainee, did not have the necessary education to carry out the task,\nsystem operators were performing a maintenance task on their own for which they were not explicitly authorised to perform, nor had they received the necessary training,\nthe deputation rules were not properly defined so there was no accountable manager onsite on the day of the accident .\n\nCauses leading to injury and subsequent death:\n\nnot using the personal respiratory protective equipment prescribed in the working procedures and work order form: instead of the prescribed compressed air breathing apparatus the use of purifying respirator protection offered less protection,\nthe shift supervisor, as the victim\u2019s direct leader, did not follow the prescriptions for the use of appropriate protective equipment and did not call the victim to account to follow either,\nfailure to provide first aid by neglecting to notify the emergency service, as prescribed by the internal rules in the event of an injury,\nfailure to notify the relevant management (including the head of the EHS division) in time, contrary to the internal regulations (blocking the possibility of medical treatment on the instructions of a senior manager),\nfailure to implement immediate decontamination of the workwear.\n\nFurther causes:\n\ntraining deficiency: documents do not show that the victim received all the required lessons (only basic recruits' training is documented),\ninadequate training topics: training for recruits do not sufficiently cover plant-specific risks and how to prevent them,\nno procedure for the replacement of used filter cartridges for purifying respirator protection: inadequate document management,\ninadequate first aid: no oxygen-assisted breathing device was used to support the ethanol inhalation,\nresponsibilities, competencies, and deputising rules were not clearly defined.\n&nbsp;\n\n",
        "Consequences": "\n1 person deceased\nno other injuries\n0.4 kg phosgene was released, so the concentration of the substance was only localised and there were no other consequences\n",
        "Emergency response": "There was no intervention by the establishment's local fire brigade or other emergency services.&nbsp;\nThe fact of accidental opening of the valve was not discovered on the spot (happened at 21:02) and was therefore not blocked. The workers left the working area in a hurry.&nbsp;\nAs an immediate measure, the&nbsp;shift supervisor instructed the system operators to shut down the technology&nbsp;(closing the chlorine and carbon-monoxide valves, and setting the blowdown to 100%).&nbsp;\nThe&nbsp;shift supervisor&nbsp;and the other system operator went back to the working area where they completed the paddle blind removal (they already had a crowbar, so they succeeded).&nbsp;\nThey realised that the remote-operated pneumatic valve was partially opened. Afterward, the shift supervisor checked the status of this pneumatic ball valve on the PLC screen. It displayed failure while receiving a closing command.\nThe valve was then closed remotely. The closed stage was displayed at 21:15 on the screen.&nbsp;\nThe installed gas detection system detected phosgene presence from 21:00 to 21:05.\nAfter the accident, neither the shift supervisor nor the system operators notified the emergency service, which would have been mandatory by the regulations. They neither notified the relevant managers - except one person, the plant engineer (who has been called at 21:55). The plant engineer, who was at home, also did not notify other managers or the emergency service. The relevant managers were not informed of the accident until the next morning, at the beginning of the shift.&nbsp;\nThe trainee system operator, apart from coughing, appeared to be in a good condition. Also, he verified that he is not feeling unwell. In the control room, the system operators and the shift supervisor questioned the trainee system operator if he needed first aid, but he did not request it, so they did not notify the emergency service.\nAs a basic treatment,&nbsp;the trainee system operator&nbsp;was continuously inhaling ethanol, but the available oxygen respiratory support device was not used. Professional medical treatment started too late, and hours later the contamination.\n&nbsp;",
        "Lesson Learned": "After investigating the causes, the operator took the following measures:\n\na trainee worker should not work in the presence of a toxic gas until becomes confident in carrying out tasks in a safe condition,\nout-of-turn training for workers,\nout-of-turn inspection of the relevant valve and process unit,\nreview of the occupational risk assessment,\nreview and modification of various training courses,\nreview of internal written procedures and instructions:\n\nresponsibilities and competencies,&nbsp;\noperating procedures,&nbsp;\nmaintenance procedures,\ndeputising procedures,&nbsp;\npersonal protective equipment allocation,\nfirst aid rules.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n"

        "Accident Description": "At around 6:00 on a Sunday, a fire broke out on 70 m\u00b3 of products used in acid surface treatment of materials in a 1,500 m\u00b2 warehouse at an aerospace manufacturing site near to an airport. The warehouse houses surface treatment lines and paint booths. The activation of the smoke detectors alerted the fire brigade. A large number of chemicals were present at the plant, increasing the risk of the fire spreading and generating thick smoke which complicated the work of the emergency services. The fire brigade set up two roof-mounted hoses, then two additional hoses and a foam hose. The fire was brought under control at 10:25.\nThe part of the workshop housing the surface treatment lines and tanks was destroyed. The damage to property is estimated at EUR 11 million. Thirty-five people have been furloughed and the shutdown of the workshop responsible for a key stage of the process could put at risk the entire activity of the site, which employs 10,000 people. 650 m\u00b3 of firefighting water was recovered in the basin provided for that purpose. In the evening, when the basin was full, the operator decided to discharge 200 m\u00b3 of contaminated water exceeding the zinc emission limit value in order to maintain retention capacity in the event of a failure of the secondary containment for tanks of surface treatment products that presented a much greater environmental hazard. The retention basin was treated by the decontamination station on site. The secondary containment and other polluted areas were pumped out by a specialist company. The operator carried out measurements of hydrocyanic acid every 30 minutes in order to be able to ask the fire brigade to close the area in the event of an anomaly. Piezometric monitoring of groundwater quality was established on site, as well as off-site sampling to assess the impact of the incident (soil and surface samples).\nThe fire was caused by an electrical fault, either in an electrical control cabinet located near to the treatment chain or directly on one of the treatment lines. That fire then spread to the rest of the installation via the plexiglas anti-splash panels, acid vapour exhaust ducts and bath tanks. It developed primarily by convection, facilitated by the draught caused by the acid vapour exhaust system and the significant fuel potential around it. The absence of smoke detectors in the area of the surface treatment chains, the limited heat and smoke venting in the room and the design of the ceiling were factors contributing to the development of the fire before the alarm was raised.",

        "Emergency response": "Two tugs maintained thrust against the barges in order to limit the strain on the bridge piers and thus prevent their fracture. Train traffic on the bridge was interrupted and the electricity was cut off. Navigation on the Rh\u00f4ne was halted. The natural gas pipeline supplying La Voulte and anchored to the deck of the bridge was secured. On 23 January, about 700 persons were evacuated in a radius of 500 m and a diversion was set up on the route of the RN 86 during the operations to clear the barge of containers with the aid of 3 crawler mounted cranes placed on the river bank. On 24 January, the barge of benzene was pumped out into a tanker barge; as this operation presented a smaller risk, the safety perimeter was reduced to 200 m. On 27 January, during work to restore the banks, a 50 kg German bomb dating from the Second World War was discovered on the line of traction of the bulldozers, less than 200 m from the barges involved in the accident.",

Other emergency actions and measures were taken in order to isolate, depressure and cool the equipment, according to emergency shut-down procedures of the plant. The fire was confronted by the emergency group of hellenic petroleum, equipped with the 4 firefighting vehicles of the company. Determinant to the firefighting attempt was the intervention of the fire brigade that took action immediately. The incident got under control in 30 minutes, it was restricted to a limited area at around 6:00 am and all the small fires around were extinguished except a small one which continued up to 12:00 am.

Two employees were exposed to the gas, resulting in the death of one of them.\nThe chain of events leading to the accident started when an attempt was made to remove a precipitate adhered to a reactor vessel using mixed acid waste containing hydrogen fluoride and nitric acid. The reaction between the precipitate and mixed acid waste generated toxic gases that spread from the reactor vessel to the process facility through an open sampling connection. The employees were exposed to gas when they attempted to stop the dangerous reaction.",
        "Causes of the accident": "During the investigation, significant deficiencies were discovered in the assessment of and preparation for risks. It has been investigated that the following factors had a particular impact on the accident:\n\nThe hazards of mixed acid waste were not sufficiently understood in the company, and conflicting information about them was available.\nRisks associated with the process had not been assessed sufficiently. The significance of risk control measures was not sufficiently understood, and they were not followed at the time of the accident.\nNo instructions or closely defined procedure were available for the removal of the precipitate.\nThe root causes of previous incidents taken place in the process had not been identified sufficiently.\nThe process did not include any measurements, alarms or other automatic protection measures that would have alerted employees of hazards or reduced the risk of human error.\nThe impact of the technical modifications made or the need to change working instructions had not been assessed.\nThe employees\u2019 training, competence and protective equipment were insufficient to act in a serious (major) gas leak.\n",

The hazardous properties and classifications of waste must be compared to the waste items permitted for handling and storage in the production plant\u2019s licences and to the classifications of hazardous chemicals.\nOperators that handle and store hazardous chemicals must address the volumes of chemicals generated by identified dangerous reactions or other incidents when defining the scope of operations in permit applications (ratio calculation).\nTukes (CA) must ensure that the volumes of chemicals generated as a result of any loss of process control and the impact of any accident have been assessed and presented in the permit applications of production plants.

The two operators were blown back by the force of the explosion. They were covered with a wet burnt powder. Two other operators, who were opening the drums 2 metres away, were also blown back and covered with wet powder. Subsequently, all four operators were drenched under emergency showers. They suffered superficial burns to the hands and face and spent one night in a local hospital. They suffered no side-effects.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nInvestigations showed that the incident was initiated by the ignition of solvent vapours, which resulted in a dust explosion of the dry powder. The solvent mixture in the reactor did not ignite. Tests carried out on the polyethylene liners inside the fibre drums showed they were earthed to the reactor at the time of the explosion but they were of the non-conducting type. The most probable cause of the ignition was an electrostatic discharge from the polyethylene bags during the reactor charging. The underlying causes were inadequate process analysis and design plant, together with a lack of safety culture, that allowed to operate with the risk of a dust explosion.\n",

The ambient temperature caused solidification of the lost inventory within the bund with no immediate risk to people or environment.Wind speed: 1.00, Wind direction: North West, Wind stability: A, Temperature: 5.00Discussion about the Occurrence:The plant had two phenol stock tanks; a larger storage tank (40 tonnes capacity) and a smaller process feed stock tank (18 tonnes capacity). The larger stock tank received road tanker deliveries and phenol needed for the process was transferred to the smaller tank in 12 tonne lots. Process phenol was then continuously circulated between the manufacturing plant and the smaller tank. The level in each tank was measured by load cells informing high weight alarms on the control panel. Shortly after a tanker delivery, the smaller (18 tonne) tank was topped up and the transfer system was set by an operator to circulate phenol for the process. However, the circulation was incorrectly set. This resulted in the closure of the smaller tank outlet and the pumping of phenol from the larger storage tank to the plant and then back into the smaller tank, which gradually overflowed into the bund. As the top-up had just been done, the panel operators had acknowledged a high weight alarm and did not spot the over-filling until the tank overflowed into the bund around it.The operator wrongly positioned valving which set the system up to take phenol from the larger storage tank, circulate it to the manufacturing plant and back into the smaller tank. The outlet of the latter had been closed hence it gradually filled up and passed out of the overflow into the bund.Had the pump mode been correctly selected for transferring to the manufacturing plant, the limt switch on the&nbsp; larger storage tank outlet valve would have been enabled and would have prevented the transfer pump operating, but&nbsp; the pump mode was incorrectly set, by-passing this interlock.Since level measurement relied on load cells, the panel operators' understanding of plant status was flawed. Just prior to the incident phenol had been transferred from the larger storage tank to the smaller (from which the manufacturing plant was supplied). The high weight alarm had been used to judge when sufficient phenol had been transferred and the alarm had been acknowledged. Not enough phenol had been used up by the manufacturing process for the weight in the smaller tank to drop and hence for the alarm to reset. Thus as the smaller tank was filling up the panel operators did not notice it.The investigation found that the mix of automated and manual systems for controlling the pump mode, switching and valve settings was vulnerable to human error.The establishment is a COMAH Lower-Tier site, which is wholly contained within a COMAH Top-Tier site.",
        "Causes of the accident": "As shown in section 3, it was important to ensure that the pump mode switch was correctly selected and that valving was set to the correct position.\n\nShortly after a tanker delivery, the smaller (18 tonne) tank was topped up and the transfer system was set by an operator to circulate phenol for the process. However, the circulation was incorrectly set.

The COMAH Lower-Tier operator engages the staff of its\nhost COMAH Top-Tier operator to run the plant to the host's operating\nenvironmental and safety management procedures. The host site's\nemergency procedures were applied to the incident and dealt with it\nwithout problem. This operator's MAPP addresses the issues around the\nincident, but the operating procedures were not sufficiently explicit,\nas there was no system for avoiding human error and the hardware safety\nsystems were easy to defeat. No actual environmental impact.\n",
        "Consequences": "The ambient temperature was such that the phenol solidified in the bund with no adverse consequences for the environment or human safety.The greatest risk was to those engaged in physically removing the solidified phenol from the bund. A detailed risk assessment and method statement&nbsp; was needed to ensure that&nbsp; they were protected against the chemical risk during clear up and when removing their personal protective equipment. The risk of spreading any contamination had to be taken into account, as did the physical effects of working strenuously in full chemical protection suitsMaterial Loss:\nThe losses comprised&nbsp; lost material, costs for disposal of waste\nphenol, cost of contractors to assist clean up and&nbsp; sundry items of\nequipment for clean up. \nAffected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",

Special precautions were taken to avoid personal contamination when removing the protective equipment.The material removed was drummed to await safe disposal in accordance with waste disposal legislation.Official action taken - legal action: An Improvement Notice was issued: the investigation found that the operator had reviewed safety systems and had identified the shortcomings, but had not completed improvements to the phenol storage facility that would have prevented this accident. The safety system review found other shortcomings elsewhere on the plant so the Notice required a detailed prioritised action plan to be developed building on the review and setting timescales for upgrades to all of the relevant plant safety systems.\t\tOfficial action taken - other official action: Further inspection visits will be paid to ensure compliance with the action plan required by the Improvement Notice.\nDiscussion about response: The operator was responsive and concerned. However, this was the second incident within a year that had involved the mix of manual and automatic systems, indirect measurement of plant condition giving operators a false impression of plant status, and the lack of a system requiring operators to confirm that they have taken correct action. The operator had acknowledged these shortcomings and was addressing them when this incident occurred. However, there was still the lack of a site-wide strategy for improvements. An Improvement Notice was issued requiring a detailed prioritised action plan to be developed building on the safety system review and setting timescales for upgrades to all of the relevant plant safety systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improvements to the phenol storage will include soft-wired alarms linked to the load cells to inform panel operators and to trip out the transfer pump at tank Hi-level.

        "Accident Description": "\nShortly after 6pm, on 2 June 2011, an atmospheric storage tank within the amine regeneration unit at the Refinery exploded. A fireball split the tank open and killed four workers. One survivor sustained severe burns and suffered life-changing injuries.\nThe force of the explosion ejected the five-tonne steel tank roof over 55 metres through the air. After narrowly missing a multi-fuel pipe track, the roof crashed onto a pressurised storage sphere containing extremely flammable butane. Good fortune prevented the airborne roof from puncturing the butane storage vessel, which would have led to an uncontrolled release of liquified petroleum gas (LPG).\nThe explosion was caused by the unintended ignition of a flammable atmosphere within the tank (17T302), during what should have been a routine cleaning operation conducted in preparation for maintenance.\nThe investigation revealed a longstanding and widespread failure to understand and control risks posed by the flammable atmosphere inside the tank. The explosion and the resulting fatalities were therefore avoidable. The incident was not merely the consequence of errors by individual employees, but because of the failure of safety management systems to ensure a safe place and safe systems of work.\n\n&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "\n&nbsp;Lack of knowledge regarding light hydrocarbons in tank 17T302\nThe Refinery possessed information relating to the contamination of the ARU running tank with light hydrocarbon. However, key Chevron personnel, some of them senior, were not aware of this fact or the magnitude of contamination. For example, the procedure entitled \u2018Action to take on LPG getting in to the ARU/SRU Flare Drum\u2019, designed to prevent LPG entering the running tank, was not fit for purpose and routinely ignored.\nInadequate risk review\nFollowing the decision in 1998 to operate the ARU as a closed system, there were a number of events that should have triggered a review of the unit risk assessment, in particular the need for repeated removal of excess light hydrocarbon material that had accumulated within the running tank. At no time did this repeated accumulation of material trigger an investigation into the cause, including sampling and analysis of the excess hydrocarbon material removed.\nThe application of site-wide procedures, for example for hazardous area classification (HAC), should have, but did not, identify the risk of a flammable atmosphere within the running tank.No safe system of work\nThe work carried out was not based upon a formal procedure or work instruction, which itself should have been developed based upon a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, industry guidance (for example the Energy Institute\u2019s Model Code of Safe Practice, Part 16: Tank Cleaning Safety Code) and DSEAR regulatory requirements.\nSignificantly, the risks posed by two potential ignition sources (electrostatic spark and self-ignition of pyrophoric material) were not fully appreciated or controlled.&nbsp;\n",
        "Consequences": "\nExplosion incident\nAn explosion occurred within tank 17T302 at 18:19 hrs. After the initial point of ignition, the overpressure created by the expanding combustion gases within the vessel ripped the tank shell away from the floor and subsequently ejected the roof. A fireball jetted from the base of the vessel, which fire-engulfed the immediate area to the south, including the vacuum tanker vehicle.\nThe explosive force projected the 5-tonne tank roof approximately 55m (see Figure 12) in a north-easterly direction to its first point of impact with the ground, narrowly missing a multi-fuel pipe track by 1m, before somersaulting and colliding with a butane storage sphere, causing structural damage to the vessel legs and supports (see Figure 13).\nFour Contractors were killed and one&nbsp;was severely burned, sustaining life-changing injuries.\nThe fire was brought under control using on-site firefighting staff and equipment. It was extinguished within approximately 23 minutes. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue service attended, deploying 10 pumps. A police helicopter used thermal imaging cameras to search for additional casualties. The COMAH on-site emergency plan proved largely effective in this case, as the fire was contained and did not spread to neighbouring vessels.\n\n&nbsp;",
        "Emergency response": "The fire was brought under control using on-site firefighting staff and equipment. It was extinguished within approximately 23 minutes. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue service attended, deploying 10 pumps. A police helicopter used thermal imaging cameras to search for additional casualties. The COMAH on-site emergency plan proved largely effective in this case, as the fire was contained and did not spread to neighbouring vessels.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nHSE believes that the deaths were preventable. The fact that the tank contained flammable material emerged several times, but the Operator did not take the opportunity to train staff and update their systems. Any change of plant operation should be critically risk assessed, adequately controlled and relevant systems updated accordingly, to ensure the significance of a newly generated hazard is not lost over time. This is particularly important where hazardous waste streams are recycled back into the process.\nOther opportunities to prevent the explosion were also missed. Two days before the incident, a gas test indicated a potentially explosive atmosphere within the tank, but this information was either not shared or acted upon by those planning or carrying out the job. Companies should reflect upon this failure and review their own systems to ensure that they provide training and arrangements for the recording and communication of important safety-critical information.\nThis incident clearly demonstrates that safety management systems are only effective when robustly audited, monitored and enforced. Safety arrangements that have been allowed to degrade over time become weak and ineffective. Whilst providing an illusion of safety and risk control, as seen in this case, ineffective systems do not remain strong enough to prevent real harm occurring. This prosecution serves as a reminder to those with a responsibility for employees and contractors to actively monitor their safety management system arrangements and ensure they are effective in keeping workers safe.\nBroader lessons\nThe law requires that companies should possess clear and accurate information regarding hazardous material stored within tanks. Furthermore, all employees and contractors involved in planning and maintenance activities on tanks should know and understand the dangers presented by the materials inside. This should include rigorous analysis (including sampling when appropriate) of the hazards of all constituents remaining within the tank prior to starting removal work. Section 2.5 of the Energy Institute\u2019s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Guidance on Tank Cleaning contains detailed information regarding pre-cleaning checks and inspections.\nA risk assessment and the establishment of clear work instructions for any tank cleaning operation should be conducted by trained and competent staff.\nTo organise the work as safely as possible, the planning and preparation work should be based on knowledge of the hazardous tank contents, combined with a good understanding of and adherence to the published HSE guidance and specific tank cleaning standards, for example the Energy Institute\u2019s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Tank Cleaning Safety Code.\nHSE believe there are some clear lessons to be learned for all businesses in relation to safety management systems. Our recommendations are set out below.\n1.&nbsp; Process safety performance indicators\nEffective management of major hazards requires a proactive approach to risk management. Information to confirm that critical systems are operating as intended is essential. Carefully chosen process safety performance indicators can monitor the status of key systems, providing assurance that major hazard risks are under control or an early warning, should controls deteriorate. HSE publication HSG254 Developing process safety indicators: A step-by-step guide for chemical and major hazard industries contains practical information.\n2. Process modification and the management of change\nProcess modifications, in this case converting the ARU from an open to a closed system, should not be undertaken without having carried out a safety, engineering and technical review. Risk assessment should then identify what hazards have been created by the change that may affect plant or personnel safety, and what action can be implemented to reduce or eliminate the risk.\nChanges may affect other parts of the plant which may be remote from the source of the change. Therefore, all parts of the plant should be considered in undertaking hazard identification and risk assessments. Additional hazards that may be introduced which need to be considered include fire, explosion and loss of containment. Further guidance can be found within HSE publication L111 The Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 2015: Guidance on Regulations.\n3. Safety-critical communications\nA communications protocol should be developed and embedded within the workplace for the transmission of safety-critical information. In this case the %LEL reading that was taken from the top of the tank on 31 May 2011. For effective communication, information to be shared should be conveyed through more than one medium, for example oral and written, combined with clarification and confirmation offered by the recipient. Clearly this relies upon employers ensuring that those involved in a task understand what constitutes safety-critical information. HSE publication HSG48 Reducing error and influencing behaviour contains relevant guidance.\n4. Competence management systems\nHazard identification, risk assessments and risk controls are all essential elements in ensuring that effective workplace precautions are implemented. Systems need to be in place to ensure that those carrying out these tasks are trained and competent, and that their work is monitored by competent managers.\nEmployers should ensure that an effective competence management system is in place, so that staff are adequately trained and competent to undertake the tasks for which they are responsible. This should include arrangements for limiting staff engagement in complex safety-critical activities, when deputising for senior colleagues. The Office of Rail and Road publication Developing and maintaining staff competence provides useful guidance.\n5.&nbsp; Management of contractors\nThe law requires that companies should possess clear and accurate information regarding hazardous material stored within tanks. Furthermore, all employees and contractors involved in planning and maintenance activities on tanks should know and understand the dangers presented by the materials inside. This should include rigorous analysis (including sampling when appropriate) of the hazards of all constituents remaining within the tank prior to starting removal work. Section 2.5 of the Energy Institute\u2019s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Guidance on Tank Cleaning contains detailed information regarding pre-cleaning checks and inspections.\nCompanies engaged in the use of contractors should assume the role of an \u2018intelligent customer\u2019, rather than relying solely upon the contractor\u2019s knowledge and experience. An intelligent customer will establish the regulatory and industry standards to which the contractor is expected to conform. The company will use this information to supervise the contractor\u2019s performance and verify the adequacy of work carried out on its behalf. The Office of Nuclear Regulation guide Licensee Core Safety and Intelligent Customer Capabilities provides useful information.\n6.&nbsp; Contractor competence\nContracting companies should understand HSE legislation, guidance and industrial standards relevant to their work activities. Technical requirements associated with topic-specific guidance, such as tank cleaning, should form a critical part of safety management systems. This is particularly important in relation to risk assessment, established systems of work, the procurement of work equipment, training and competence assessment.\n"

A likely cause is considered to have been a fault in a plug socket, which spread to the adjacent pump and plastic installations.\nHowever, this could not be conclusively determined by the operator, as the insurer\u2019s loss adjuster was only mandated to assess the consequential losses and the measures to repair the fire damage. There was no safety check of the electrical system by an expert within the meaning of Section 29b of the Federal Immission Control Act, nor was a fire expert engaged.\nDuring the fire, an electroplating bath containing 1,900 litres of sulfamate nickel leaked its contents. Electrical equipment and large parts of the air extraction system and the surrounding electrical installations were destroyed. The fire was contained and extinguished by the fire brigade. The leaked electrolyte and the fire-fighting water was retained in the collecting area in the basement. The contaminated water was subsequently pumped across to IBCs. These are to be disposed of properly in the coming days.\nSafety measure:A newly-installed fire alarm system was in maintenance mode at the time. Although it did detect the fire, it did not report it.\nAbout an hour later a member of staff on the late shift noticed the fire and called the fire brigade.",

        "Lesson Learned": "Additional checks on the electrical equipment in the room by a specialised firm. The equipment is to be reconstructed in accordance with a reconstruction plan drawn up by a specialised firm. This involves replacing the baths, which were hitherto excessively large, by smaller ones and relocating them where appropriate.The new fire alarm system has in the meantime been armed and, in the medium term, is also to be connected to the fire brigade.\n\nThe internal emergency plan is to be revised and updated to ensure that the operator\u2019s reporting requirements are fulfilled.&nbsp;\nThe electrical equipment in the whole plant is to be checked promptly by a suitably qualified employee. In addition, thermographic measurements are also to be taken.The implementation of the checks is to be documented.\nAll electrical and mechanical components that are liable to overheat in the event of a malfunction are to be checked regularly at intervals of no more than two months by means of thermographic measurements. The results are to be documented. This interval may be adjusted in response to the actual frequency of faults being detected.These checks are to be carried out systematically. The management system is to be updated accordingly. Operating procedures are to be drawn up or existing ones amended.\nAcross the whole site, any contaminated firefighting water in the event of an incident is to be contained safely using state of the art safety equipment. For this purpose, the operator is to check whether the firefighting water containment capacity available in the individual hall sections is sufficient. Where necessary, steps are to be taken to increase the firefighting water containment capacity.\n\nIn this context, attention should be paid to the following:\n\nMeasures to contain firefighting water are to be carried out in accordance with good engineering practice in safety matters.\nAll indoor pipes, such as rainwater pipes and other openings to the sewers, are to be protected up to the necessary damming level for firefighting water retention by fireproof bunding or protective tubes made from chemical-resistant, non-flammable materials so that in the event of a fire, firefighting water cannot flow unchecked into pipes or openings.\n\n\nThe pumps used are tools within the meaning of the Industrial Safety Ordinance, as the pump is an integral part of an electroplating system and is used to pump substances around that system.These tools are subject to damage from the atmosphere prevalent in the electroplating system and the substances to be pumped. To be used, they need to be operated, maintained, dismantled and monitored.The employer must assess the risk arising from the use of tools and take the appropriate safety measures accordingly. This also means taking into account the hazards arising from the use of the tool within the working environment. The manufacturer\u2019s instructions on testing cycles, among other things, give rise to the following measures for testing tools:\n\n\nThe risk assessment pursuant to the Industrial Safety Ordinance should be revised and documented with regard to the issues raised above.\nMeasures arising from this are to be implemented.\n"

        "Causes of the accident": "As an operator was mixing and heating a flammable mixture of heptane and mineral spirits, he observed a dense fog accumulating on the floor below the tank. He notified a senior operator and both shut down the operation. They evacuated and warned other workers to do the same. After 10 minutes the cloud ignited and there was an explosion.Among the causes that led to the accident, the following can be cited:- The investigation after the accident revealed that the tank temperature controller had not been installed or maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications, which could have caused it to fail.- The mixing tank was not equipped with a temperature display or high temperature alarm, and there was no backup shutoff device. The procedure for this mixture required the operator to verify the temperature by climbing the stairs to the upper level to measure it using a hand-held infrared thermometer. If after checking the temperature, the mixture overheated, the operator would not know until the vapours overflowed from the tank.- The ventilation in the mixing area, consisting of local exhaust and area ventilation systems, was incapable of controlling vapours released from the tank, since it was not designed to capture and remove a high volume of vapours released from an open tank, and because&nbsp; two exhaust fan drive belts were broken before the incident. Regarding the area ventilation systems, they were located at a significant distance from the tank, so they were incapable of removing the vapours.- The mixing room was designed to avoid ignition sources, but the adjacent area where the cloud migrated and most likely ignited was not.Therefore, if the design for the process had included proper safety controls (i.e. local exhaust ventilation, high temperature alarm, and a backup steam shutoff) the vapours would not have overflowed the tank and migrated into the adjacent areas where multiple ignition sources existed.",
        "Consequences": "One contracted delivery driver was killed and one employee was injured.\n\nThe fire and pressure from the initial ignition produced moderate damage to the structure and interrupted operations for nearly one month.",
        "Emergency response": "The worker in charge of the operation notified the situation to a senior operator as soon as he noticed the vapour cloud. They shut down the operation and advised workers in adjoining areas to leave. They warned the contracted driver to evacuate, but apparently he was talking on his cellular phone and did not hear them.The local Fire Department battled a fire confined to a bagged resin storage area for about 3-4 hours. Injured workers were taken to hospital, one of them died after several days, the other one stayed in hospital for 3 days.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The company suspended the flammable liquid mixing operation indefinitely.- A design professional should manage the design and construction of a facility that uses flammable liquids.- An experienced code reviewer knowledgeable in flammable and combustible liquid safety should thoroughly review facility design plans.- Facilities handling flammable and combustible liquids should implement an Emergency Action Plan and practice evacuation drills at least annually, but more frequently if necessary to keep employees prepared.&nbsp; "

        "Accident Description": "On the 24th of April 2017, at 2.43 am, a trip occurred in&nbsp;an ammonia plant due to an&nbsp;external power supply fluctuation. The dip lasted 0,4 seconds. This fluctuation caused automatic&nbsp;shutdown of the plant, a normal shut-down operation was&nbsp;performed, and flammable content&nbsp;flared off. After having stabilized the process, the production shift were preparing the plant&nbsp;for&nbsp;restart. All seemed to be normal, restart procedures are followed,&nbsp;but at&nbsp;03:15 an explosion occurs, followed by an intense oil&nbsp;fire in the compressor hall. Two operators are present, and evacuate without&nbsp;physical injuries.&nbsp;Internal and external fireservices are on site shortly&nbsp;after, and 45 minutes later the fire is extinguished, and they can see that the main syngas oiltank&nbsp;(lubricant oil) has \u00abtorn\u00bb and that the fire can be localized to&nbsp;this tank.&nbsp;\nImmediate consequence on people&nbsp;was limited to psychological impact (one&nbsp;employee in a long sick leave). In terms of environment there was a limited oil&nbsp;release to the fjord that&nbsp;was rapidly taken care of. Extensive damages have been observed in the electrical/instrumentation systems and in the compressor hall.&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "The initial power fluctuation did not cause the accident, but&nbsp;initiated the shut down.\nThe direct cause is the generation of an explosive and highly sensitive atmosphere in&nbsp;the vapour phase of the main oil tank, because&nbsp;Oxygen enriched air came into the nitrogen purging system from&nbsp;the Air Separation Unit.\nThe main root cause:&nbsp;an uncontrolled Management Of Change on the air&nbsp;separation unit trip system that allowed enriched air to be sent in the nitrogen grid. The nitrogen grid was supposed to be a safety barrier in the syngas compressor oil tank explosion scenario.\u2013 a low suction pressure trip had been removed some years back (2011), but was still mentioned in both P&amp;ID and standard operating&nbsp;procedure.&nbsp;\nContributing factors:\u2013 Lack of Process Hazard Analysis that generated inadequate standard operating&nbsp;procedure and inadequate training.\u2013 Lack of proper alarm management program and poor human machine&nbsp;interface\n&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "Immediate consequence on people are limited to psychological impact (one&nbsp;employee in a long sick leave). In terms of environment there&nbsp;was a limited oil&nbsp;release to the fjord that&nbsp;was rapidly cleaned. For the asset part,&nbsp;extensive damages have been observed in the electrical/instrumentation systems.&nbsp;Large fire damages on building, no damages caused by overpressure. The oil tank is to be reconstructed. Main compressor train was effectively protected&nbsp;by the water mist system. The cost estimate is around 165 MNOK, and the&nbsp;reconstruction period was 4 months. Reputational impact&nbsp;was limited.\n&nbsp;",
        "Emergency response": "Emergency response was adequate both from the operating shift who rapidly&nbsp;stopped the process and activated the mitigation systems and from the emergency&nbsp;response team who safely and promptly extinguished the fire in the compressor&nbsp;building.&nbsp;\nThe on site water mist system worked. Due to an open door, foam leaked out from the building.\n&nbsp;",
        "Lesson Learned": "An uncontrolled MOC and a lack of process hazard analysis in connection with a change, generated&nbsp;inadequate standard operating procedures and inadequate training. a lack of a propaer alarm management program and a poor human machine interface."

        "Accident Description": "During general \u2018shut-down\u2019 of the Refinery, several maintenance works were taking place. A contracting company was working on the replacement of a 6\u2019\u2019 gate valve on a piping network at the Unit U-3300 (catalytic reforming of naphtha\u2019s). The gate valve was placed at the battery limit of the reformer unit which connects U-3300 with a storage tank. After the removal of the existing valve, reformate naphtha started to flow from the one end of the open pipe. The amount of release was approximately 30 m3. A loss of containment (LOC) of reformate (gasoline component) during the replacement ignited a large-scale fire. The accidental release and subsequent fire of naphtha resulted in 4 fatalities and 2 Injuries.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Inadequate implementation of the work permit procedure and incomplete equipment isolation.\nThe gate valve -that was on the outer limit of the unit- was not accompanied by a second valve, drainage and check valve.",
        "Consequences": "4 fatalities, 2&nbsp; injuries, localized&nbsp; equipment damage.",
        "Emergency response": "After combined actions by the refinery fire brigade, which was immediately activated, and by operations personnel, who isolated the open pipe, the fire was extinguished in 20 minutes.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Although investigation of the accident is still in progress, it seems that the strict application of the existing work permit procedure could prevent lack of communication between the two different departments involved in the area of the accident (the reformate unit and the tranfer unit) and ensure complete equipment isolation before maintenance works."

        "Emergency response": "The neutralization of sulfuric acid with lime, that was located on the site (approximately 1700 kg), as well as urgent measures until arrival of the company AEKS to prevent / reduce the spread of acid in the soil. Acid and contaminated soil was removed from the porous substrate in a temporary landfill. For the soil remediation the Elaborate of remediation of pollution due to leakage of sulfuric acid in Terminal \u017ditnjak was created, and submitted to the Competent Ministry. After a disposal of neutralized soil at a temporary landfill, a series of tests of physical and chemical properties of waste (through an accredited laboratory) were conducted. The soil was treated with lime and the neutralizer DE-01, with occasional tumbling inside the landfill to a satisfactory result, which is with the permission of the Ministry of Environmental and Nature Protection, transported and disposed of at landfill Jaku\u0161evac (the Zagreb Holding Company), in the amount of 113 360 kg, a key number 19 02 03, and the accompanying documents.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In the area of Terminal \u017ditnjak is not possible to repeat the kind of events that includes sulfuric acid, because the tank was emptied. As an additional measure, it was done the cadastre of pipelines in Terminal, separated and clearly identified pipelines used by the JANAF, and in the process of relocation are all pipelines that are used by other companies. Additional education is implemented for outside contractors."

        "Accident Description": "Mixture of non-compatible chemicals during transfer from the iso bulk container of the supplier to the tank of the operator.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Explosion happened in a storage area where a change in the storage and loading of epichlorohydrin (EPI) has been realised in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe operator decided to change the storage of EPI by replacing the 210 l storing units with 60 m3 tank (C2). With this new tank also new loading station was set up for loading of EPI into C2.\nEPI, like all chemicals that are stored in the storage area, are delivered to the site by ISO containers.\nThe operator was aware of the hazard arising from the fact that two incompatible substances were stored in the storage area: EPI and DETA (diethylenetriamine). When planning the change in storing and loading EPI, the operator aimed at realising the change that would inherently prevent mixing of incompatible substances. &nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe initial idea was to install loading devices which would support inherently safe loading of EPI by using specific coupling on the EPI station loading hose to be compatible only with a connector on the delivery hose of ISO container delivering EPI.\nIn the course of the change realisation it became evident that this idea was not a viable solution since the supplier of chemicals with ISO containers could not ensure ISO containers with specific connector for EPI deliveries only. This was due to the fact that all ISO containers \u2013 regardless the chemical they contain \u2013 are equipped with EURO connector.\nFinally for the delivery of EPI the operator did install specific coupling (Camlock type D) in the EPI loading station which was different from couplings at loading stations of other chemicals (EURO coupling). Camlock coupling could be connected to ISO container with EURO connector only with the use of an adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe operator has due to change in the storage and loading of EPI modified the safety report, including HAZOP study. In this study a hazard of mixing incompatible substances has been recognised. This hazard has however not been recognised as possible cause of a major accident scenario. The HAZOP group recognised installation of specific coupling in combination with the identification of in-coming chemical as sufficient measure to prevent mixing of incompatible chemicals which could lead to an explosion.\nOn the day of the accident the immediate cause of the explosion were multiple human errors: the driver of ISO container with DETA parked the vehicle in front of the EPI loading station,&nbsp; the un-loading operator overlooked the hazardous substance label on the vehicle which clearly indicated that DETA was in the container, the un-loading operator also overlooked the indication in transport documentation that DETA has been delivered and finally he started loading DETA into wrong tank before having received the results of substance identification from the laboratory to which the sample of in-coming chemical has been sent. &nbsp;",

        "Lesson Learned": "1. Design engineers must ensure that they have reliable input data for design of safety-relevant process/devices in Seveso plants.\n2. The operator must ensure effective management of changes in the plant - not only that something is evaluated, but also by checking whether the planned change ensures safe operation;\n3. The management is responsible for ensuring that the HAZOP is based on Good Engineering Practice, and that the HAZOP is revised also for the purpose that insufficient measures are identified;\n4. The management must ensure that all errors which arise from the development/design phase while they are waiting for the wrong combination of conditions to cause an accident, are identified;\n5. The management must provide that communication channels important for safety operations are properly established and thus maintains them;\n6. The management must ensure that there are procedures at the workplace with clear steps in the work process with clear instructions which safety measures the workers must take to ensure that the operation will be carried out safely;\n7. The operator must include all safety-relevant workplace in the Safety Report and create a matrix from which the required training content and work instructions are determined for all workplaces.\n8. The management must ensure that the employees are familiar with the work instructions and ensure that the participants and training content are traceable.\n9. The management must provide appropriate, hihg-quality, concrete and sufficiently frequent training on explosion protection for all employees who work or may be present in an area at risk of explosion. The content of training must also include the measures from ATEX documentation and work procedures.\n10. For all positions the operator must check the introduction program for \u00bbnew employee\u00ab and create the specified program also for the filed of Occupational Health and Safety at work, or integrate the field into existing programs in such a way that the introduction will be carrried out in accordance with the Act of Health and Safety at work.\n11. The operator must establish the training procedure in such a way that for the introduction of \u00bbnew workers\u00ab, it\u00b4s clear that they are being introduced by a competent person in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety at work and Explosion Protection Act. The operator must provide that records of both theory and practical knowledge test are kept as evidence of competence. For all positions (jobs) the operator must provide records/tests that checked the worker exactly according to specified instructions."

        "Accident Description": "On 20&nbsp;December 2012, there was a fire in a residue incinerator.Due to inversion of the colour coding of the rising pipe and pressure pipe nozzles on a tank container, mass flow into the plant was 15 to 20-times higher than during normal combustion operations.\nEmergency shutdown of the plant was implemented by on-site staff; in addition, various parts of the plant were automatically switched off and locked.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Inadequate (unclear) labelling of the rising pipe (product) and pressure pipe nozzles by the waste supplier.",
        "Consequences": "Damage to the plant, in particular the electrostatic precipitator (flue gas cleaning).Contamination of vehicles in the vicinity of the plant due to deposited soot particles.",
        "Emergency response": "- Analysis of air and swipe samples.- Informing the local community.\nCleaning and repair of the plant.Air measurements and swipe samples.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Trapo customers were contacted by the operator to ensure clear allocation of the agreed colour coding to the Trapo connectors (nitrogen/rising pipe connector - blue/red).\nThe management of the residue incinerator informed staff about the incident and its causes.\nThe operating instructions for emptying the Trapos have been supplemented so that clearance from the shift leader is now required before N2&nbsp;\u2018back flushing\u2019 is carried out if a riser/connecting arm is believed to be obstructed. The process should additionally be supervised by staff on the process control system (in particular monitoring weight decrease).\nThe operator will schedule a meeting soon with the waste supplier to come up with a retrofittable technical solution (e.g. differing connector sizes) to prevent Trapo connectors from being confused again in the future.\nThe residue incinerator is looking into a metrological solution that will allow relevant quantities of liquid entering the pressure relief system to be reliably detected, an alarm raised and the plant locked."

        "Accident Description": "An explosion occurred at 3.35 p.m. at a pyrotechnics storage facility classified \u2018Seveso upper-tier\u2019. The site manager was using a forklift truck to transfer explosive materials between the loading/unloading bay and one of the warehouses. He was killed on the spot. A second worker nearby was also killed.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The classified installations inspectorate identified several significant shortcomings:\nA forklift was used instead of the dedicated in-house vehicle for transferring products between the loading/unloading bay and the warehouses\u2019 delivery area;\nThe pallet on which the cartons were placed was not film-wrapped.\nThe route followed by the forklift was on a slope. A package appears to have fallen and been run over by the wheels of the forklift. There was then a friction/hotspot effect on the pyrotechnic substance that had spilled on the floor. This is based on the fact that the fork became detached from the forklift and the vehicle\u2019s wheels were torn off and blown outwards around 20&nbsp;m on each side. This configuration indicates that the initial load affected was probably under the forklift and that the explosion spread to the main load on the pallet.\nSeveral other theories such as the pyrotechnic substance being unstable, pyrotechnic material leaking following a quality fault in a maroon, etc. have been discounted. Indeed, maroons from the same batch have been examined by experts without any anomaly in terms of stability or conformity being revealed. The products, which were manufactured by a Portuguese company, had been delivered the previous day to another site managed by the operator and then transferred that morning, for storage, to the site where the accident occurred. The operator had been working with that manufacturer for around 10 years. However, this was the first time it had ordered 75 mm maroons of this type.",
        "Consequences": "The body of the site manager was found beside the forklift. That of the second worker was found further down from the site of the explosion, having probably been moved when a 120&nbsp;m3 water tank burst.\nThe 2 people who died were the only people present on site when the accident occurred. The site manager, who died in the accident, had worked there for 18 years. The second victim was a temporary worker who had been employed for the season.\nA crater 1&nbsp;m wide and 0.3&nbsp;m deep was formed. The forklift was completely burned out and had been shifted back 5&nbsp;m from the crater. Metal and plastic debris from the forklift was scattered across a radius of 30&nbsp;m. The roofs of 2 warehouses 50 m away were damaged, presumably by the blast. There was no damage off site.",
        "Emergency response": "Two of the company\u2019s workers who had left the site a few minutes before the events turned around after hearing the explosion and observed the release of a plume of white smoke (mushroom). They raised the alarm. The internal emergency plan was launched. Firemen put out the fire on the forklift.",
        "Lesson Learned": "After the accident, the operator:\nDecided to completely stop buying maroons and products in hazard division 1.1;\nReminded staff of the categorical ban on using a forklift to transfer products between the loading/unloading bay and the warehouses\u2019 delivery area;\nReiterated the need to transport products in closed packages, and for packages to be film-wrapped when on pallets;\nPut in place security meetings twice a week in busy periods;\nPut in place checks (scheduled and unscheduled) to ensure that instructions, safety rules and operating procedures are followed properly. These checks will be carried out by managerial personnel not involved in production;\nCommissioned an audit of how operations are organised;\nUpdated the establishment\u2019s hazards study, particularly as regards analysis of the risks linked to handling and internal transport of pyrotechnics."

        "Accident Description": "A fire occurred in a corner of the waste station at a lower tier COMAH site used for the treatment and storage of chemical waste. The fire rapidly spread to the rest of the transfer station, resulting in the violent rupture of numerous 205 litre drums and small aerosols. There were no on-site casualties. Some off-site ill-health symptoms have been reported, but there is currently no conclusive evidence of long-term impairment of the health of any members of the public.The incident was compounded by serious flooding in the area causing the site to be cut-off four days after the incident, and accessible only by boat. The majority of the site itself was flooded to varying depths.The incident is reportable as it meets the following criteria:a) COMAH schedule 7, Part 1, para 1(a) - a fire involving a quantity of at least 5% of the qualifying quantity (for top-tier application of very toxics), andb) COMAH schedule 7, Part 1, para 1(b)(v) - evacuation of persons/time being greater then 500 hours. On the day, 60 people were evacuated for 12 hours. Further evacuations occurred the next week due to concern about possible on-going side effects.Type of accident - Remarks: A fire occurred at approximately 02.00 on Monday 30 October 2000 in a waste storage area at Cleansing Service Group Ltd (CSG), Upper Parting Works, Sandhurst, Gloucester. The site is a licensed waste treatment facility and transfer station for a wide range of hazardous waste chemical substances and is notified as a Control of Major Accident Hazard Regulations 1999 (COMAH) Lower Tier site. The fire originated in compound 1 of the waste transfer station in the southwest of the site which was unoccupied at the time, rapidly spreading to other areas of the site.\n\nThe incident occurred at a time of severe storms with gale force winds and very heavy rain. Wind speeds peaked at 50 - 60 mph. These extreme weather conditions continued to cause problems throughout the day.\n\nThe Fire Service accessed the site via the fields to the south, due to the very strong prevailing wind from the south. Throughout the day, water and foam were applied to the fire which was concentrated at the south end of the site. The fire was eventually fully extinguished by 18.00 on the 30 October, having burned for approximately 16 hours, although a number of drums involved in the fire continued to smoulder. The fire was restricted to the waste transfer area and did not affect the bulk tank storage on site. Most of the firewater was retained on site, by site containment measures, but some contaminated water escaped and had to be pumped back.&nbsp;Meteorological conditions - Remarks: Details above from Met Office via Gloucester Fire Service.\nSevere weather warning issued by the Met Office at 04:07 Monday 30th October 2000 (affecting Gloucestershire): severe south westerly gales with damaging gusts to around 80mph and outbreaks of heavy rain will gradually clear eastwards during the morning. The strong winds are significant as this is the possible cause of drum falling and initiating the incident. Also significant in spread and severity of fire.Precipitation: rain; Wind speed: 216.00; Wind direction: SSW; Wind stability: D; Temperature: 12.00\nChronology of incident:- On Monday 30 October 2000 at approximately 02.00, a fire occurred in compound 1 of the waste transfer station in the southwest of the site (unoccupied at the time).- First call to the emergency services was logged at 02.19 and the Fire Service arrived on the scene within 6 minutes.- Agency staff attended immediately. HSE and other parties, including Gloucestershire Health Authority (GHA), also attended during the incident.- The Fire Service was unable to approach the site for some hours because of the intensity of the fire and small aerosol cans exploding.- The incident occurred at a time of severe storms with gale force winds and very heavy rain. Wind speeds peaked at 50 - 60 mph. These extreme weather conditions continued to cause problems throughout the day.- The Fire Service set-up a forward command post in the car park of the Globe public house, located on Sandhurst Lane approximately 1km south of the site. At approximately 10.40, this site was evacuated due to the expected flooding of Sandhurst Lane. The command post was re-established at the southern end of the lane, approximately 2 km from the site.- The Fire Service accessed the site via the fields to the south, due to the very strong prevailing wind from the south. Throughout the day, water and foam were applied to the fire which was concentrated at the south end of the site.- The fire was eventually fully extinguished by 18.00 on the 30 October, having burned for approximately 16 hours, although a number of drums involved in the fire continued to smoulder.- The fire was restricted to the waste transfer area and did not affect the bulk tank storage on site. Most of the firewater was retained on site, by site containment measures, but some contaminated water escaped and had to be pumped back.- The Fire Service remained in attendance overnight. They relinquished control of the site early the next morning, the 31 October, allowing access on to the site for HSE and the Agency to begin investigation of the incident.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Main failings identified by the investigation:1) Failure to have an adequate system for the reception of waste onto the site in that containers of waste were not categorised according to a suitable hazard classification system. The classification according to hazard forms an essential part of a safe system for allocating appropriate storage locations.2) Failure to have an adequate system for the safe storage of different classes of hazardous materials. This system would have included, in addition to the hazard classification discussed above, the following elements which the site failed to implement:\u00b7a) an up to date plan of the storage areas showing appropriate locations for the different hazard categories. This would include suitable segregation/separation distances between the different hazard categories marked on the plan and would be derived from the risk assessmentb) an adequate segregation and separation policy as part of clear, easy to follow procedures to ensure that the findings of the risk assessment were implemented. These procedures should be linked to the procedures for pre-booking waste to be delivered to the site to ensure that designated storage areas, as marked on the site plan, are not exceededc) adequate instruction and supervision arrangements to ensure that the procedures and arrangements shown on the storage plan are implemented in practiced) adequate arrangements for ensuring that laboratory smalls are separated into drums according to hazard category and that these drums are then stored appropriately according to that hazard (ie not all drums of lab smalls stored in the same place irrespective of hazard)e) adequate arrangements for the exclusion of all ignition sources from areas where flammable liquids are stored, including the installation of suitable electrical equipment which will not introduce an ignition risk.3) Failure to carry out a suitable risk assessment into the hazards and risks associated with the storage of dangerous substances in containers. The failings included:\u00b7a) no consideration of specific substances or generic categories of hazardb) inadequate consideration of storage arrangementsc) inadequate consideration of control measures to prevent any incident except for reliance on employees' intervention to prevent escalation of any incidentd) no consideration or comparison of applicable guidancee) no specific consideration of laboratory smallsf) segregation was not considered as a safeguard or preventive measure for the prevention of fireg) assessment focuses on the personal safety of individual employees and does not adequately consider the risks of accidents that may cause harm to groups of persons or to persons outside the site boundary, or the risks to the environment.",
        "Consequences": "The Site Operator has estimated that the cost of the incident has been approx 5 million euros, of which 1.4 million are insured and 3.6 million uninsured. This includes both direct costs from the incident (site restoration, loss of business etc) and other costs as a result of findings from the investigation (including the disposal of radioactive materials found on the site and the investigation of unauthorised disposal of waste at the site).In addition to the costs above there are the fines and costs from the Court cases described below and the charges made under COMAH by HSE (of approximately 120,000 euros). This gives a figure of approximately 7 million euros. Also as a direct consequence of the incident the site never returned to operation and has now permanently closed.There were no on-site injuries or ill-health. Nine people were taken to hospital for examination on the day of the incident (believed to be 4 fire service personnel, one policeman, and four local residents) but none were detained in hospital. Subsequently numerous reports of illnesses to local residents have been reported. Direct linking of these reports to the incident&nbsp; is unclear and is being investigated by the local health authority. None of the 17,500 tests carried out on over 500 environmental samples indicated any significant levels of contaminants off-site, although contaminated firewater run-offs is believed to have killed several hundred worms. The Environment Agency is continuing its' investigation into the long-term environmental effects. Environmental MonitoringA plume of smoke from the fire was driven by the high prevailing wind in a north, north-easterly direction over the village of Sandhurst.&nbsp; No samples from the plume were obtained. Modelling work on the contents and the fate of the plume was commissioned as part of the legal investigation. The findings of this work are to be used with the human health study.&nbsp; The Environment Agency and contractors undertook sampling of soil, water and air in and around the site.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was targeted as much as possible to identify whether residents and their properties had been exposed to significant levels of harmful substances from the fire and the subsequent flooding events. Evidence of contamination on site and where firefighting run off water had collected was found.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no evidence, from the media tested, to indicate that there had been widespread contamination off site at levels hazardous to health or the environment.&nbsp; Results of property monitoring were provided to residents and all results are available from the Environment Agency.Soil samples obtained in June 2001 showed no selenium or arsenic above the detection limit and contamination was restricted to elevated levels of phytotoxic metals (Lead Nickel and Copper) within the fire fighting wash water zone immediately adjacent to the site.&nbsp; All other results were at background levels.A macro invertebrate survey of the Horn's ditch (which is adjacent to the site) in July 2001 revealed biological quality had marginally improved from a previous survey undertaken in 1996.The Horn's ditch was also electro-fished in July 2001 and found roach and eels to be present. There is no historic data available for this stretch; however the results are what would be expected for such a watercourse.A survey of teasels (a form of thistle) was undertaken in the locality. This indicated an atmospheric discharge of selenium did take place during the incident in an area close to the CSG site.Subsequent sampling of nearby pylons and new growth teasels, both proved negative for selenium.In summary, the results of these surveys do not indicate any significant long term contamination and discussions will be undertaken with FSA, Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs and NFU to decide if further monitoring is appropriate.A precautionary pollution warning was issued to Severn Trent and Bristol Water but there was never considered to be a risk to drinking water abstraction as the Severn Trent abstraction is upstream of the incident. The flooding was preventing abstraction from the river Severn from taking place at the time of the incident and hence Bristol Water was also unaffected.Community Disruption:The fire resulted in the Police evacuating approximately 60 local people at the time, who were allowed to return to their homes that evening, the 30 October. The evacuation itself was hampered by the fumes from the fire. 13 people sought medical advice (mostly emergency service personnel but including some local residents) although none required admission to hospital.There was significant off-site concern, with the formation of a local pressure group, campaigning primarily to stop the site re-opening; this was successful as the site did close down following the incident.Media interest was also significant, in both local press (print &amp; TV) and national (print &amp; TV).There was much interest from the Local Member of Parliament with questions raised in Parliament and consequent interest by Ministers (a number of reports were prepared for the Deputy Prime Minister - details see C4c below).",
        "Emergency response": "The Fire service attended to deal with the fire, supported by the Police and Ambulance services. On the day, 60 people were evacuated for 12 hours. Further evacuations occurred the next week due to concern about possible ongoing off-site effects, compounded by serious flooding in the area. Emergency action and site restoration was co-ordinated by Gold Control (Police, Fire, County Council, Health etc).Official action taken - legal action: COMAH Prohibition NoticeThe measures taken for the prevention and mitigation of major accidents are seriously deficient in that site has not implemented the necessary measures for the safe storage, separation and segregation of flammable substances, incompatible chemicals, laboratory smalls and other packaged dangerous substancesOutcome: Notice complied with by site submitting revised COMAH notification (that they are no longer a COMAH site).Health and safety at Work etc Act 1974 Improvement NoticesHealth &amp; Safety at Work etc Act 1974 Section 2 (1) adequate arrangements for ensuring, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the health of your employees is protected from contact and/or proximity to radioactive materialsOutcome: Notice complied with.Health &amp; Safety at Work etc Act 1974 Section 2 (1), do not have suitable and sufficient arrangements for ensuring, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safe storage, separation and segregation of flammable substances, incompatible chemicals, laboratory smalls and other packaged dangerous substances.Outcome: Notice withdrawn when site closed.Management of Health &amp; Safety at Work Regulations 1999 Regulations 5, 8, 9 &amp; 13, did not establish and where necessary give effect to appropriate procedures to be followed in the event of serious and imminent danger to persons at work in your undertaking.Outcome: Notice withdrawn when site closed.Charges brought by HSE1.

        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: The Environment Agency National Action PlanIn the April 2001 report, the Agency detailed its National Action Plan for ensuring that the lessons learned from CSG Sandhurst are implemented across England and Wales. The plan covers seven key issues requiring review, these being:\u00b7Issue 1: Licensing arrangements at CSG Sandhurst\u00b7Issue 2: Licensing arrangements for chemical waste treatment and transfer facilitiesIssue 3: Emergency response arrangementsIssue 4: The balance of maintaining customer confidence in the licensing process and taking enforcement actionIssue 5: Officer awareness of Agency policy, procedures and practice on inspection and prosecutionIssue 6: Environmental policies and proceduresIssue 7: Health and Safety policy issuesSpecific actions are identified under each of the above issues, (21 in total), along with a manager responsible for taking the action forward and a target date for completion. HSE ActionsHSE paper has been presented to the Hazardous Installations Directorate (HID) (Land Division) Management Board on the lessons identified during the investigation of the CSG incident. The report identified issues in four key areas that have been acted upon, these being:\u00b7a) emergency response - substantial changes have been made to the Directorates emergency response arrangements.b) working with the Agency - HID have progressed common operating instructions and procedures when working with the Agency as the Competent Authority and specific arrangements have been made to work more closely where COMAH does not apply.c) prior regulation of the site - HID have reviewed the arrangements made for carrying out \"prior role\" enquiries and are about to produce additional guidance for staff.d) chemical waste treatment industry - a new joint inspection initiative involving the HSE and the Environment Agency was conducted in 2002 (see below).Joint Inspection InitiativeA joint HSE and Agency inspection/enforcement initiative was undertaken because of concerns that arose not only from this incident, but incidents at other such sites. The inspection initiative was necessary both to ensure that health, safety and environment provisions are complied with and to demonstrate better standards of control within the industry. The joint inspection initiative included:a) a seminar with representatives of the chemical waste treatment and storage industry.b) conducting inspections at waste treatment and transfer establishments.c) providing feedback to the chemical waste treatment and storage industry. The inspection initiative was formally launched at a seminar, held jointly by HSE and the Agency, on 14 May 2002 in Birmingham. The seminar was attended by about 50 representatives of the industry, including representatives from both large national companies and from small/medium enterprises. Senior HSE and Agency staff introduced the seminar, outlining issues of concern and the purpose and implementation of the inspection initiative.The seminar encouraged an open discussion with the industry that recognised the need to take action to ensure compliance and to improve the public perception of its activities. One of the outcomes was that the Agency, HSE and the industry will develop better communications and if necessary produce an industry code of practice to set standards for health and safety controls that are specific to this business. A report of the findings of the joint enforcement and inspection programme was published in February 2004.Useful References:\"Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP into the major fire on 30 October 2000 at Cleansing Service Group Ltd, Upper Parting Works, Sandhurst Lane, Sandhurst, Gloucester GL2 9NQ\"(http://www.hse.gov.uk/hid/sandhurst/csg1rept.htm)Progress Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP (April 2001)(http://www.hse.gov.uk/hid/sandhurst/sandhurst2.htm)Progress Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP (July 2002)(http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/csg_update_report_july_02.pdf)Final Report for Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Department for Works and Pensions (September 2003) (http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/csg_sep_03._609513.pdf)HSL Work following the fire at CSG Ltd., Upper Parting Works, 30th October 2000, FR/01/08HSL Report on potential mechanism for fire propagation at CSGHazardous Waste Storage and Treatment Facilities 2002/2003.

        "Accident Description": "During the cleaning of a storage tank, an explosion occurred. The roof of the storage tank flew away and landed about 100 metres further.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Human error: even though the employees knew in general that the cleaning of the tank could be dangerous, they did not check if there were special dangers involved in the cleaning of this specific tank. It was a routine job. Even though they could have known that the concentration of the MTBE was above the upper explosion limit (UEL), they opened the manhole while the vacuum pump was working. Because of the open manhole the concentration of the MTBE decreased. The concentration was lower than the UEL. Most probably the vacuum pump has caused the ignition and the explosion.At the preparing of the cleaning job with a high pressure water rotary jet (400 bar), there has been no specific safety analysis carried out. The high pressure rotary jetting is known to accumulate electrostatic electricity. In an atmosphere of combustible mixture it caused an explosion. There were no such risk/danger mentioned on the safety work permit. The cleaners were because of that not informed/instructed about the risks.",
        "Consequences": "1 person died immediately (immediate fatality).Persons - Remarks:2 painters near the place were the roof landed and 3 cleaning operators were at risk. If the roof had landed somewhere else more people could have been at risk.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",

On-site systems: unknown at this momentEmergency measures - Remarks: The operators have been re-instructed about the safety permit procedure at the issue of safety analyses. The specific procedure about high pressure rotary jet cleaning has been reviewed in co-operation with SIR, Stichting Industriele Reiniging (industrial cleaning institution).Official action taken - legal action: An official report was made by the labour inspectorate.Official action taken - other official action: Review of the procedure about high pressure rotary jet cleaning was required.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: All cleaning activities at the site where\nstopped. From now on for all tank cleaning can only be done after\nthorough checks for possible explosion dangers.Measures to prevent recurrence: Safety analyses need more attention particularly in the case of procedures like high pressure rotary jet cleaning."

        "Accident Description": "On 20 April 2019 during the night shift, rinse water accumulated in the collecting basin and was transferred into the underground sewer, where the technical service found a pool measuring approximately 1 m\u00b2.The fluid leaked from a gap in the tiles of the sewer wall.\nThe technical service immediately passed on this information to the on-site fire brigade. The fluid leakage stopped when the rinse water transfer sequence was terminated.\nThe technical service informed the electroplating foreman after Easter Weekend (23 April 2019). As an immediate measure, staff members were informed that accumulation of fluids in the acid receptacle was no longer permitted.\nOn 12 June 2019, there was leakage once again when a hydrochloric acid pipeline that runs through the acid receptacle began to leak.It was determined that the acid was leaking from another spot in the acid receptacle. A gap in the faulty joint measuring approximately 0.5 cm was discovered therein. The joint was sealed with special adhesive on 13 June 2019.\nSafety measure:A notification was received from the sump in the underground sewer, and as a result, staff members from the technical service carried out a visual inspection during a patrol of the underground sewer, and the transfer of rinse water was stopped.",
        "Causes of the accident": "On 20 April 2019, leaks from a joint in the acid receptacle or a crack in the wall of the receptacle were suspected. The specific location of the leak however was not discovered until 12 June 2019 with the leakage of hydrochloric acid. There was a piece of a joint that had broken away.\nThe cause of this was likely ageing, i.e. material fatigue.\nOpinion:The collecting basin, which dates from 1966, appears to be ageing to such an extent that, due to deterioration and fatigue, its containment capabilities must be called into question altogether. This however cannot be verified (as the majority of the collecting basin is below ground and inaccessible).\nThe flaw in the joint or the wall only became apparent during a patrol of the underground sewer, the only area that is accessible.",
        "Consequences": "The leakage of these substances incurred costs related to the following measures:soil testing, waste disposal, emergency containers, rerouting of pipework (for changing the method of operation), remediation, and surveillance cameras.

Costs: EUR 5,000",
        "Emergency response": "During the event:Organisational measures implemented (terminating the transfer of rinse water from the acid receptacle and specifying that the collecting basin must no longer be used for the accumulation of fluids).\nAfter the event:\n\nGauges installed;\nAdditional container (with a volume of 30 m\u00b3) acquired and installed for emergencies (collection of dangerous fluids during a fire or malfunction, etc.);\nLeaking joint sealed;\nOn-site meeting with experts on the AwSV and the expert body on water management (district authority) organised;\nVisual inspections of the underground sewer wall carried out once daily to check for any new leakage of fluids.\n\nSince 9 May 2019, site contamination experts have been present on-site. Test boring of the buildings and soil matter conducted at various points in the walls and under the acid receptacle. Weekly inspections of the groundwater carried out by the operator\u2019s laboratory.\nRemedial measures only possible if the overall condition of the collecting basin can be clarified by the experts.\nRemedial measures under the acid receptacle are difficult, and chromium contamination is present, according to the first laboratory analyses of the affected area; remediation is possible only if the acid receptacle is rebuilt.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nImmediate restoration of the functionality of the acid receptacle;\nDescription of how to approach a possible malfunctioning of the acid receptacle in the safety report;\nAdjustment of the acid receptacle\u2019s method of operation (more direct transfer of rinse water in pipes to the underground sewer, accumulation of fluids in the acid receptacle no longer necessary).\n\nFunctionality of the acid receptacle is sufficient."

        "Accident Description": "At around 2.15 p.m. on 21 December 2020, during a stage in the process for incinerating some materials, explosive material ignited and exploded in the area of room 80 (static furnace and associated equipment). Specifically this occurred in the area under the canopy close to the static furnace, from which the products to be destroyed are fed into the furnace via a modelled sheet metal slide.\nAt the time, nautical signalling flares and other materials contaminated with explosives were being incinerated in furnace 80.\n\nFragments of composite propellant\nSignalling flares\nBlocks and planks of wood contaminated with trinitrotoluene (TNT)\n\nThe excess pressure produced by the explosion, which is believed to have occurred around 2 metres from the left-hand side of the furnace, caused the deaths of the three workers present:\n\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;The foreman, an expert in handling explosives;\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;A worker, an expert in handling explosives and the static furnace;\u2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;A worker, an expert in handling explosives.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident occurred shortly before the end of a shift, scheduled for 3.00 p.m., during the incineration of explosive materials. To date, the company has not been able to identify sufficiently precisely what might have caused the ignition of the material and the resulting explosion.\nBased on the initial analyses carried out, and following the observations made by the inspection panel established by the Regional Technical Committee (CTR) to conduct an extraordinary inspection following the accident, the company decided to take action in relation to the following potential problem areas that it had identified:\n\nprocedural arrangements, particularly the operating procedure for moving and incinerating materials;\ntraining for staff members and supervision by those in leadership roles;\nthe recording and traceability of materials leaving a work area and entering room 80, where the static furnace is located;\nintroducing CCTV monitoring, including so as to be able to objectively reconstruct the lead-up to accidents and near misses;\nmore careful management of access to the plant.\n",

        "Emergency response": "Following the explosion and the noise it made, the Safety Officer (RSPP), who was in room 40 at the time, raised the alarm and the internal emergency plan was triggered. At the same time, the Safety Officer and the internal emergency response teams began checking the situation in the surrounding areas to establish whether there were any secondary fires or injuries.\nA report of the accident was received in the control room of the fire brigade headquarters in Chieti at around 2:40 p.m. from the Carabinieri station in Vasto, which reported an explosion at a firework factory in the vicinity, without giving any further details.\nIn order to obtain more detailed information on the event, staff at the fire brigade control room immediately contacted the firm, learning that the accident had involved three workers who had unfortunately already died as a result of an explosion in room 80 at the plant. As a result, the control room immediately dispatched two crews to the accident site, from the fire stations in Vasto and Ortona respectively. The Local Command Unit and duty officer from the fire brigade headquarters in Chieti were also sent. Later on in the technical relief operation, the fire brigade control room asked for a drone team, and the national fire brigade operations centre in Rome dispatched one from Bari. The control room also asked for a team from the specialised earth-moving unit, and the Abruzzo regional fire brigade directorate dispatched one from L\u2019Aquila.\nThe next day, at around 10:15 a.m., explosive ordnance disposal experts and fire fighters accessed the affected area to carry out a detailed examination of the site where the explosion occurred, before clearing the area with the remote support of an ambulance from the 118 emergency medical service.\nThe clearance work started at 10:40 a.m. and was completed at around 2:00 p.m., with aerial video support from the fire brigade drone. During the clearance work aimed at minimising the risk of further explosions, the disposal experts recovered all of the active explosive products still present (flares, nautical smoke signals, etc.) and moved them away from the area beneath the canopy where the explosion occurred.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Further work to raise awareness among those in leadership roles about supervising operations and among workers about carefully performing the tasks assigned to them. More than once, people interviewed stated that the reasons for the foreman being present in the area of the accident were not clear. Equally important, there should be awareness raising among staff so as to ensure that their years of experience do not cause them to perform operations or handle materials in an over-confident manner.Review of the procedures for moving materials, so as to be able to identify in real time all of the materials that move from the work rooms to the incineration room.Review of the operating procedures so as to ensure that the instructions in them are consistent. Examples here are procedure P.80.03 Annex 4 \u2018Incineration of THUNDERFLASH pyrotechnics\u2019 and procedure P.40.320 \u2018Extraction of gunpowder from THUNDERFLASH ELECTRIC D54\u2019, in which it is not clear whether or not water is compatible with the gunpowder extracted. Given that water is known to react with mixtures containing aluminium powders, the inspection panel believes that the practice of soaking the Thunderflash powder immediately before it is fed into the furnace was adopted without clear assessments and laboratory tests that took account of the characteristics of the product, the operations and the associated risks.Importance of managing the restart of activities following the accident and long-term closure of the plant through a training plan and programme (information-provision, training and drills) that takes account of the workers\u2019 long period of inactivity and the resulting review of the operating procedures, as well as appropriate inspection and maintenance of the equipment that has been out of use for a long time.\n&nbsp;"

The sparks, generated by a scraper, probably reached the paper rolling machine forming smouldering nests in a base-paper roll which was being processed. The roll was then transferred&nbsp; into the fully automatic operated storage installation, the so-called Jumbo roll storage. The storage installation contained approximately 1800 tons of base-paper rolls for the production of paper towels.Later on smoke was noticed by workers of the processing department; the search in the processing department and the storage installation allowed to identify a smouldering paper roll.

        "Accident Description": "On 1 September 2018, at approximately 5:11, a large amount of flammable liquid (light cracked petrol (LCP), boiling range 20-140 \u00b0C) was released spontaneously at a refinery site.The cause of the release was a crack in the container wall.\nAt the time the event occurred, the installation was operating normally.The reactor\u2019s internal pressure was approximately 24 bar, the internal temperature ranged from approximately 130 \u00b0C to approximately 148 \u00b0C and the flow rate of the feedstock LCP was approximately 32 t/h (immediately before the event, at approximately 5:05, the flow rate was increased from 30.8 t/h to 32 t/h). All in all, the reactor\u2019s operating parameters immediately prior to the event do not show any anomalies, in particular any increase in pressure or temperature.\nAs the reactor is designed to have a pressure of 38 bar at 300 \u00b0C, the above-mentioned operating parameters at the time of the event do not indicate that the reactor was overloaded.\nDue to the release temperature (130-148 \u00b0C, which is partially above the boiling point of components of the feedstock LCP), a large cloud of explosive vapours immediately formed. The solvent vapours were mixed with air by the horizontal air coolers in the area of release and blown upwards. The rising explosive vapour cloud was ignited at height, presumably on the uninsulated hot surface of one of the installation\u2019s columns (outside of the hazardous area).An explosion occurred, causing the significant quantity of flammable liquid present on the ground to ignite into a large fire. Although the release of the petrol vapours was detected by the gas sensors in the processing plant, the vapour cloud explosion occurred immediately afterwards (rapid sequence of events).\nAs a result of the explosion and resulting fire, in a neighbouring installation (an ether installation) another reactor also ruptured and the product (mainly butylene) was consumed by fire (or by a smaller explosion).&nbsp;This installation is still closed off by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, so the cause has not yet been confirmed.&nbsp;\nPresumably, the first explosion shifted/deformed an air cooler in the ether installation in such a way that pipes connected to it were deformed (a pipe with a safety valve or a flare line, as the case may be), the pressure safeguards were no longer sufficient and the reactor \u2018burst\u2019 due to excess pressure or heat as a result of the intense fire surrounding it.\nThe on-site fire brigade and other emergency and rescue services that were called to the scene fought the large fire resulting from the explosion and the release of a large amount of flammable liquid and prevented the fire from spreading to other refinery installations and storage tanks. The above-mentioned second (\u2018smaller\u2019) explosion occurred shortly after the emergency services arrived on site.\nAs a result of the explosion and resulting fire, multiple installations were destroyed or seriously damaged and rendered unusable. Buildings on the refinery site (including a control room and a fire station) were also destroyed or seriously damaged. Damage to approximately 100&nbsp;buildings in the surrounding area was also reported. Due to the large amount of smoke produced, approximately 1800&nbsp;people were evacuated from the refinery\u2019s surroundings.\nIn total, approximately 30&nbsp;people were on site at the time of the event.\nEighteen people were injured, six of whom had to be hospitalised. Several people were given psychological care.\nThe emergency services took immediate and effective action to prevent the fire from spreading.\nThe on-site fire brigade, which was first on the scene, immediately called on other emergency services from the surrounding area. Up to 600 emergency and rescue personnel were on site.\nNo additional emergency measures in response to the event were required. After the event, the accumulated firewater was assessed in accordance with VdS&nbsp;2557 and in line with the requirements of TRwS&nbsp;779.\nSafety measure:\n\nGas detection system was triggered. An explosion then occurred, resulting in a fire. Emergency shutdown of the plant was triggered. Firefighting efforts by fire services.\nRestoration of on-site fire brigade\u2019s operational readiness.\nProcess plants close to border with other systems isolated (exception: flare system in operation).\nResidual contents of the damaged installations were released to the flare system or emptied into the slop system.\nStatic testing of buildings was carried out.\nSafety systems worked effectively with regard to the incident.\n\nThe release of the product from the reactor in this magnitude is a \u2018Major incident despite preventative measures\u2019, for which no further safety measures are expected.

        "Start Date": "1987-03-13 15:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "1987-03-13 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The ambient temperature was near freezing and this allowed significant liquid to condense out in the flare pipelines. Wind conditions were slight and the vapours from the spilling liquid were not dispersed. In early 1986 it was noted that the flare gas recovery system was operating at reduced efficiency. Gas which should have been recovered was being routed instead to flare. Investigation revealed that a 750 mm valve was passing gas when in closed position. A decision was taken to have the valve removed to carry out repairs to it. It was appreciated that there would require to be careful planning to prevent the possibility of leave refinery units being inadvertently isolated from the flare system. One of the flares would have to be taken out of service and therefore the potential flaring demand of the refinery would need to be matched to the remaining two flares. At a number of meetings of operational and maintenance staff, an agreed flare alignment procedure was drawn up outlining flare system conditions necessary for removal of the valve. The earliest time to carry out the work was to be in early 1987 when 2 of the refinery units and flare No 1 were planned to be out of service for routine maintenance. The detailed work methods and safety requirements concerned with the actual removal of the valve were not considered at the meeting. No difficulties were foreseen and the works were organized and arranged by operations department technicians. Few days prior the accident, the valves to isolate live parts of the flare system from the section under maintenance were closed. Immediately prior to work commencing, the BP technician checked the status of isolation valves and he also identify conditions in the isolated section by opening a small valve on the liquid drain line at a distant flare knockout drum. Finding no indication of gas or liquid coming from the valve he assumed that the flare line was isolated, depressurised and free of liquid. Near the work station were located 2 water monitors to disperse residual gas if it should flow out when the valve was removed. Two refinery fire-fighters were present to operate the monitors and to oversee the use of the breathing apparatuses being used by the workers as protection against potentially toxic residual gases in the flare line. Also in the work area there was a crane to lift the heavy valve and a diesel engine compressor to supply air for the breathing apparatuses. Being everything in order, the BP technician issued the permit to the contractor and work commenced. Two fitters and a rigger prepared to remove a flange ring spacer to insert a blank spade in its taken by a crane. Suddenly it pulled upwards and torrents of liquid gushed out to cascade down over the scaffold. Gases from the spilled liquid spread over the ground igniting on the engine of the air spread to cover the pool of liquid and envelop the scaffold and the men in a raging inferno.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:When a ring spacer was pulled free during the removal of a gate valve, torrents of petroleum spirits gushed out to cascade down to the ground below. The liquid was ignited by a nearby air compressor engine (used to supply air for the breathing apparatuses of the maintenance crew) and a pool fire occurred. The scaffold platform and the people on it were enveloped in flames.CAUSES:It soon became apparent that in the flare pipework scale had formed over the years. This scale had flaked off from internal surfaces to accumulate at the bottom of the flare pipelines where it turned into a thick viscous-sludge in the presence of vented and condensed hydrocarbon liquids. The sludge had found its way into the guides of flare line wedge gate valves which where thus prevented from closing fully. Sludge had also passed down liquid drain lines at the knock-out drums to cause them to block. Therefore the normal drainage built into the flare system no longer operated and as a result substantial quantities of liquid accumulated. The flare line isolation valves had no means of indicating their fully closed position. It was assumed that exerting considerable force on the handles of valves was sufficient indication. Many of the suppose closed valves were found to be jammed and were still allowing free passages of gas. The pipe to the valve used to test line conditions was also blocked with sludge. Therefore presence of liquids and gases in the line was not identified when the valve was open. Furthermore, the technician judged that residual flammable gases in the flare pipe presented no significant fire hazard. Therefore the system was not purged with inert nitrogen nor steam. In addition, the flare drainage was not verified as being clear of blockages nor the valves as being clear obstruction by the use of injected steam. Work methods have not been planned to take sufficient account of the risk of residual liquid being present in the flare.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:When the liquid was ignited, the scaffold platform and the people on it were engulfed in flames. Two people were killed and two others people were injured by fire.MATERIAL LOSS:The fire was readily confined to the work area and, therefore, damage was suffered only in its proximity (to pipelines, to electrical cables/equipments, to the crane and to the breathing air compressor). The cost of the material damages has been estimated in about 0.28 MECU.Disruption of community life: The usual response on receipt of an emergency call for a fire at the refinery was to commence off-site procedures. However, they were stood down within a short time as it became apparent that there would be no major hazard nor off-site risks (in the Original Report there is no evidence of significant effects outside the work area).Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The refinery fire brigade was called and quickly arrived on the scene to assist the two stand-by firefighters already fighting the fire. A few minutes later, units of the local fire brigade arrived. The fire was readily confined to the work area. To ensure that recovery of the bodies could be carried out in safety, all operating refinery units which could have continued in feeding into the flare system, were shut-down. Nitrogen gas purging of the flare lines was commenced.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The usual response on receipt of an emergency call for a fire at the refinery, was to commence off-site procedures. However, they were stood down within a short time as it became apparent that there would be no major hazard nor off-site risks.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:&nbsp; After the accident, the following measures were established:1- any work on the refinery flare system has now to be authorised at senior management level. There is no formal requirement for the planning of work to take into account all potential risks. Work methods and safety precautions must be detailed in writing and agreed by representatives from a number of refinery departments who in turn will closely monitor work as it progresses;2- each valve should have an indication of its position and at the base of critical isolation valves have been added orifices to which steam can be injected to dissolve blockages;3- verify the performance of flare drainage;4- purge lines with inert nitrogen gas to clear residual flammable gases and to prevent air from reaching any pyrophoric scale inside the pipes;5- move flanges apart gradually with bolts still in position until the contents of the line can be positively identified;6- use trays under the flanges as they are moved apart to collect liquids in a safe way;7- avoid diesel-engine operated compressors nearby; at locations to which the refinery air system does not extend, mobile air storage tanks should be provided for breathing apparatuses.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- alternative escape routes from scaffold platforms or any work area must always be available;\n2- staff on the work must be equipped with flash-fire suits;\n3- remove personnel away when the final lift is carried out;\n4- drench the valve removal area and scaffold platforms with ground-level fire monitors as the lift is carried out;\n5- provide a refinery fire tender on stand-by at the scene."

As the repair work on the nozzle section could not be completed on the same day, the nozzle section on the tank was partially or fully sealed with a perforated sealing plate (rain protection). The tank, both filled as well as emptied, was in normal operation for several days with the temporarily perforated and weighted sealing plate over the nozzle section.

Both product intake and removal and temperature variations can create sufficient pressure differentials to jeopardise tank integrity in the absence of ventilation.Changes in workflows, particularly revised implementation or extended duration, mean that particular attention should be paid to communication between contractors and the responsible plant management. Plant management should be aware of the state of the plant and ensure that it is safe.If workloads are heavy, security-related tasks must be performed. This calls for prioritisation to take place with line managers. Achieving this requirement calls for a culture that allows staff to address such situations and managers who possess the awareness to promptly identify the threat of overload.The human factor in safety must not be overlooked."

        "Finish Date": "2019-04-03 17:20:00",
        "Accident Description": "Only maize silage is used as a substrate in the biogas production plant concerned. No slurry or other co-substrates are used. Experience suggests that no critical H2S concentrations are to be expected in such a biogas production plant.Nevertheless, a dangerous release of hydrogen sulfide occurred.\nThe causes of the hydrogen sulfide formation are related to the trial operation of a digestate thickening plant operated at the operator\u2019s premises by an equipment supplier in trial mode. The plant had not yet been handed over to the operator. As part of this trial operation, the equipment supplier tried to achieve the agreed process parameters. As this did not work, the operator did not continue the procedure. The plant was shut down by the supplier and subsequently dismantled. The substances produced during the trial and introduced into the existing digestate storage facility remained behind.\nAn expert concluded that microbial processes could be a possible cause of the hydrogen sulfide formation. From the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Office for the Environment, Land Surveys and Nature Protection\u2019s point of view, hydrogen sulfide could also have been formed as a result of a pH reduction by the sulfuric-acid process chemistry combined with the accumulation of sulfur-containing components in the digestate storage facility.\nThe supplier of the plant could no longer be involved in the investigation of the event. Operational data on the trial operation, in particular on the composition and quantities of substances produced in the digestate storage containers, were no longer available. There was no longer any technical communication with the plant supplier.\nLean gas, which is used to produce heat in a catalytic afterburner, is stored in the gas storage tank of the digestate storage tank concerned. It is connected to gas analysis apparatus. This showed no noticeable H2S values before the event. The operator had no indication of possible dangers from the stored digestate. Consequently, a hazard analysis, which would have revealed increased hydrogen sulfide formation, was not carried out.\nIt was planned to spread the digestate on the agricultural land in the surrounding area during the upcoming season. The event occurred at the filling plant.\nDuring the filling of liquid digestate at a filling station, hydrogen sulfide escaped in dangerous concentrations, the driver of the collection wagon lost control, became unconscious and fell from the slurry container.\nThe driver needs to hold the switch at the top of the container down for the pump to run (dead man\u2019s switch). He was supposed to stand at the top to prevent the container from overflowing.\nThe accident occurred during a normal filling process. The plant was operational.\nSafety measures:Filling process interrupted by dead man\u2019s switch \u2013 no further filling planned.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The event is linked to a digestate thickening process. The process equipment in question was no longer in operation at the time of the event. It had been dismantled during the commissioning or testing phase. The processed liquid digestate from this process equipment was stored in the digestate storage facility concerned. There was no documentation of the substances, data and quantities introduced in the course of commissioning.\nThe significant H2S formation was observed only on digestate that had undergone a separate thickening process. That part of the digestate flow which was not subjected to the thickening process did not show excessive H2S formation. The cause of the H2S formation should therefore be sought in the thickening process.\nIn the thickening process, the fermented substrate (digestate) is separated in a separator into solid and liquid phases. The solid phase is excluded from the further process and sold as solid fertiliser. In the liquid phase (filtrate), a vacuum distillation system separates the filtrate into thick sludge and ammonia-rich water vapour.To recover the evaporated ammonia, the steam is condensed and sulfuric acid added to the condensate. A diluted ammonium sulfate solution is produced. In a subsequent reverse osmosis, the ammonium sulfate is further concentrated and the filtered water is evaporated.\nIn the digestate storage facility, only thick sludge from vacuum evaporation was collected. According to expert opinion, the boiling of digestate under vacuum may burst the cell membranes of all the micro-organisms still present in the liquid digestate. As a result, new biological substance is made available in the fermented material. At the same time, the increase in temperature sanitises the material and stops fermentation.If the nitrogen sludge obtained in vacuum evaporation is then transferred to a non-sterile digestate store, the thick sludge is metabolised there by the active anaerobic biotic community still present in the substrate store. This means that biological gas formation activity recurs in the digestate store in material that should already to a large extent have been completely rotted.As the substrate store is only stirred extensively, intensive release of gas by the shearing and cavitation forces occurs during pumping only when filling the container.As the digestive thickening equipment has already been dismantled and, due to a lack of documentation, it is no longer possible to clearly understand which substances and what procedural steps can be decisive in causing the significant formation of hydrogen sulfide, it is not possible to come to a conclusive explanation of the causes.\nThe out-of-spec formation of hydrogen sulfide is undoubtedly the cause of the personal injury that occurred. The root-cause analysis for the large-scale formation of H2S does not lead to a clear conclusion. The description set out under \u2018Causes\u2019 is based on the views of the expert consulted. Other considerations, such as the possibility of a temporary drop in the pH value in the digestate stored, could not be pursued due to insufficiently documented operational data on digestate evaporation.",
        "Consequences": "Two injured persons.",
        "Emergency response": "After the event, the filling station was closed by the supervisory authority. Around 200 m\u00b3 of the substrate in question were still stored there. Ways of disposing of it safely were examined.Oxygen (through an air separation plant, 95% purity) was introduced into the pressure chamber of the filling station to continue biological desulfurization. The existing gas was burned off using a special flare. During combustion, the remaining substrate was stirred.The flare was operated until H2S could no longer be measured in the crude gas.\nA risk analysis was carried out by an external engineering firm for the filling and unloading of the filling station and an operating instruction was drawn up. A safety distance was set during the filling process, which was monitored metrologically. Filling was carried out with at least two persons. Despite safety precautions, a further accident occurred with one injured person (short-term loss of consciousness) during the third filling process. In the cab of the towing vehicle, H2S gas was drawn into the foot well and entered the driver\u2019s cab through the cab ventilation system, which was running.Escape was not possible as the windows of the driver\u2019s cab were closed. In terms of metrology, only the filling area was initially monitored. When the door was opened, the gas flowed towards the driver and led to a short period of unconsciousness. The other person supervising immediately alerted rescuers.Before it was spread, the remaining substrate was first examined from the point of view of soil compatibility. The analysis showed that from the point of view of soil chemistry, there was no obstacle to it being applied to fields. In agreement with the Agricultural Office, the application was carried out by means of injection technology in remote fields.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The relevant substrate thickening process is no longer used at the site. A different process from another manufacturer is used.Accessible platforms with railings were installed at the filling stations. This avoids the need to climb on the tanker. In addition, a mirror has been installed on the outlet pipe so that the fill level of the tank can be ascertained from the ground.Each tanker must register and then de-register after a specified period of time.Otherwise, an alarm will be triggered in the control room. The alarm is directed to the mobile phone of the members of staff on duty.The entire filling area is under video surveillance.\nFindings from the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Office for the Environment:\n\nRisks from hydrogen sulfide formation can also arise under certain conditions in biogas plants using only renewable raw materials and where additional processing facilities, such as digestate thickening plants, are operated.\nThe operator is responsible for safety throughout the operational area.&nbsp;They must ensure that extensions and additions to the plant originally operated are checked for safety and that dangerous interactions are avoided. To this end, a systematic hazard analysis should be used.\nThe systematic hazard analysis must also cover trial operation.&nbsp;Defects and deviations from biological and chemical process parameters must be taken into account.\nThe safety management system must cover changes to the installation and the activities of third parties (e.g. suppliers / plant manufacturers). This includes requirements to document trial operation and regular review and assessment of the documentation.\n"

On July 28, 154 kg of crude 1-methyl-2-formyl 1-nitroimidazole were loaded in the reactor and heated with heating medium at 100 degrees Celsius, with the intention of dropping the hot liquid into 20 litres glass distillation bowls. These bowls would then be used in the pilot plant distillation unit. Distillation of the crude product at 100 degrees Celsius under vacuum had shown by laboratory trials to yield pure product. When the solid lumps of crude product were almost dissolved, the reactor's agitator was turned on. Shorlty afterwards the mixture began to boil up. A yellow fume began to emerge from the closed man-hole. The pilot plant operator exit quickly and within seconds 2 successive explosions were heard. Process plant on both the first floor and ground floor pilot plant was severely damaged. The roof of the pilot plant was blown off. The internal walls between the pilot plant and laboratory and the process area were blown down. External walls were severely damaged and two window frames were blown out. Glass windows were shattered up to 30 m away. Missiles from the pilot plant were projected up to 60 m away. The head of the process reactor was projected through the roof and landed about 30 m away while the bottom portion was projected from the first floor area down to the ground floor area and embedded in the floor. One person working in the adjacent main production area received shoulder injuries resulting from a fall. Another person suffered a slight cut and shock. Although there was no damage off-site the sound of the explosion was heard some distance away. In a town 2 km away windows were shaken and the noise caused considerable public concern.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nThe explosion occurred during the heating of 1-methyl- 2-formyl-1-nitroimidazole at 100 degrees Celsius in a closed reactor under vacuum. The explosion was caused by the decomposition of the product due to the heating. As the liquid level in the reactor was below the temperature probe, its exact temperature was unknown. It was thought that it was below 100 degrees Celsius of the heating medium in the reactor's jacket. The company was concerned about the potential explosive properties of the compound due to the presence of a nitro- group and recognised the need for explosivity tests. At the time of the explosion they had not done these tests. The material was an intermediate and no health and safety information was available. The substance was still at pilot plant trials stage and the company intended to compile the relevant data if the process developped to full production scale.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:2 people were slightly injured by the explosion: one person working in\nthe adjacent main production area received shoulder injuries resulting\nfrom a fall; another person suffered a slight cut and shock.MATERIAL LOSS:Extensive damage to plant and internal/external walls. Around the pilot plant also roof damage and some glass damage to windows of the main building and to cars in the company car park. The cost of the damage has been estimated at about 0.65M Euros.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The smoke from the fire and the explosion drifted slowly (calm day) towards a nearby town. It slowly dispersed over a number of hours. No smoke monitoring was carried out but the public was concerned. The manufacturer allayed the public's fears by stating on national radio and TV that the smoke was not toxic.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The extents of the effects are shown on a map attached to the Original Report. Only industrial population in the adjacent area. No significant overpressure were observed off-site. Glass breakage was confined to a 30 m radius within the site. The windows of houses in the town 2 km away shook (blast effects compared to 2.5 kg TNT equivalent approximately).Disruption of community life: No significant overpressure were observed off-site but the windows of the houses in the town 2 km away shook. The smoke from the fire and the explosion drifted slowly (calm day) towards the nearby town and dispersed over a number of hours. No smoke monitoring was carried out but the public was concerned. The manufactures allayed the public's fears by stating on national radio and TV that the smoke was not toxic. The policemen evacuated two nearby factory units.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the explosion occurred all personnel went to the assembly area in accordance with the site's emergency plan. The company fire crew equipped with breathing apparatuses, put out small fires. They were aided by the local fire emergency services. Three units of the local fire brigade arrived on the scene and found\nthat the fire was under control. Approximately 5 fire brigade personnel\naided the company fire crew in the pilot plant area. One fire brigade\ncrew remained on-site for two hours until the \"all-clear\" was given.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Approximately 3-5 policemen closed off the access road to the factory. Three units of the local fire brigade arrived on the scene and found that the fire was under control. Approximately 5 fire brigade personnel aided the company fire crew in the pilot plant area. One fire brigade crew remained on-site for two hours until the \"all clear\" was given. The policemen evacuated two nearby factory units. Total number of people evacuated was approximately 300. The smoke from the fire and the explosion drifted slowly (calm day) towards the nearby town of Shannon. It slowly dispersed over a number of hours. No smoke monitoring was carried out but the public was concerned. The manufacturer allayed the public's fears by stating on national radio and TV that the smoke was not toxic.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: The company has discontinued research and development work for the foreseeable future and have to concentrate their activities on existing processes. The hazard evaluation of these processes is being reviewed prior to recommencement of each in turn. If the company reintroduces research and development work on new processes it will be done only after that a satisfactory programme is put in place to ensure an adequate hazard evaluation at each stage."

Consequent to&nbsp; this event an employee was fatally injured. At the time of the occurrence the dosage system was undergoing technical modifications with the goal of increasing the dosage range of formaldehyde. The modification consisted in adding two ball valves to the two existing control valves in order to increase the technical safety of the system. To perform the modification disassembling of the two existing control valves and of partial pipe sections was necessary.An employee was given the job of preparing the disassembling operation by disconnecting the pneumatic and the electric connections from the valve bodies and installing the connections for the pneumatic and electric control of the new ball valves.These operations were prepared correctly and partially performed. At the time of the occurrence one of the control valves still had to be&nbsp; installed and consequently the pneumatic and electrical control systems were not connected.The point in which the valve was to be installed was not sealed.Approximately 30 litres of a 93% phenol-water solution at 508 C were released by an operational error of the employee, who activated via a function switch the opening and closing of a pneumatic ball valve in the phenol dosage section.

        "Causes of the accident": "Chemical reaction08/09/98 at 17:30 a hydrogen peroxide container burst.At 16:30 hrs an abnormal condition in a hydrogen peroxide tank, containing approximately 85 m= (60% of its capacity), was noticed due to a change of the crystalisation parameters displayed by the remote monitoring system, and the release of the overflow protection alarm.An inspection showed a decomposition reaction of the hydrogen peroxide. A clearly detectable foam layer had formed and had released the overflow protection alarm.About 30 l of phosphoric acid added immediately for stabilisation, had no apparent effect. Next, a valve was closed between the first tank and an adjacent tank connected to it, and the first tank's contents was drained into a secondary containment basin. At the same time, the drained hydrogen peroxide was diluted with water, and the vapours were abated. In addition, the tank was externally cooled with water.Because of the risks for the emergency response team, the drainage had to be stopped. In spite of the measures taken, the temperature was still rising.Around 17:30, a fountain-like jet of hydrogen peroxide erupted from an open manhole. While the emergency response team started to withdraw the tank burst, the remaining hydrogen peroxide was dispersed over a large surface. 10 members of the fire brigade suffered skin burns. Most of the hydrogen peroxide was deposited within a distance of 30 m, and was then diluted and washed away with water (transitory storage in the emergency retention basin). A minor quantity of hydrogen peroxide came down beyond the perimeter of the plant as a droplet cloud, in the neighbourhood of the plant. As a preventive measure, the population was alerted.Cause: Probably the hydrogen peroxide was contaminated by alkaline process solution, which initiated the decomposition reaction. As a possible pathway, a ventilation pipe of a ring line\u00a0 was identified as possible inlet point. This ventilation pipe leads to a decanter, used for a safe drainage of hydrogen peroxide in case of release. If the drain line of the decanter gets obstructed, the filling level in the decanter can rise significantly submerging the ventilation pipe with process solution. Considerable quantities of the process solution can therefore flow back into the tank without being detected.",
        "Consequences": "10 members of the fire department's emergency response team were injured by the released hydrogen peroxide.\nThe material damage totals ca. 1.000.000 - DM 500.000 EURO.\n",

Some of the material was automatically pumped over to the effluent plant before the leak was discovered. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "IMMEDIATE CAUSES: 1. Loss of corroded carbon steel drain plug from transfer pump casing. Plug should have been stainless steel.2. Duration of release (and hence quantity) extended to over 2 hours because of inappropriate response (no action) to 2 alarms on DCS system which were accepted by the operator with no follow up response).\nUNDERLYING CAUSES:1. Maintenance error - fitting of incompatible drain plug at some point in the past. Maintenance records show that the plug has not been removed from the pump since 2000, but service history is not available prior to this date due to a change in the site's maintenance management software.2. On 6th August 2012 (the day before the incident) the pump was inspected by the Senior Process Technician and an Engineer who suspected a small leak from the pumps seal (no visible leak but a smell of formaldehyde). A new pump seal was ordered for replacement at the next opportunity. The pump was left in service pending this repair.3. This COMAH Major Accident scenario (LOC from transfer pipe work or pumps) was not identified in the Safety Report. Effective preventive and mitigation measures for this particular scenario had not been assessed nor implemented.",

        "Emergency response": "The emergency response and clean up operation functioned well apart from the fact that it was not initiated until 2 hours after the leak started.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The root cause of this incident lies in the predictive section of the safety report. A flawed hazard screening methodology excluded this and similar scenarios (LOC from pipe work and pumps) from the representative set, so no specific prevention and control measures had been assessed or implemented."

The operator noticed a light smoke in a combustion chamber and after verification of the correct lighting of the burners, initiated the alarm for low percentage of oxygen in the smoke of the combustion.&nbsp;&nbsp; At a second inspection he also discovered a small hole in a tube of the serpentine. It was then decided to shut down the plant in a controlled way following the procedures described in the operating manual for losses of small scale, which required the shut-down of the burner in the near chamber (the involved chamber was kept running in order to burn the product escaping from the hole) and reducing the income flow to the minimum value.The situation in the combustion chamber worsened when two other tubes began to leak and the flame propagated externally up to a few meters outside the chamber.&nbsp; The plant was then rapidly shut-down and the emergency ended quickly with the burn-out of the flame in the internal of the chamber due to the consumption of the fuel, the use of a vapour jet, and the extinguishment of the external flame with the use of foam by the emergency intervention forces internal to the refinery.&nbsp; The incomplete combustion caused the release of a dense cloud composed by the combustion products from the chimney to about 500m in the west direction towards the first houses of the village of Rocca Priora.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident originated from the rupture of a tube, located about 3/4 of the height in the first pass in the combustion chamber (side \"Ancona\"), and later involved other two tubes, one in the same chamber and another down in the convection chamber. In a first internal report of the company two hypothesis were put forward: either partial obstruction of the tube passage due to an anomalous detaching of the coke, which \nnormally forms a layer inside the tube, or a defect of the material of the tube at the point of the rupture. From the successive analysis of temperature of the tube passages and the product flows, the technical note supports as the most plausible hypothesis the material defect of the tube which was the origin of the first loss, and which would not have been evident during the normal operation of the plant.\nThe hypotheses put forward on the accident causes (material defect or less probable, anomalous detachment of coke with partial obstruction of the tube) permit the following considerations. The ruptured tube was in the zone of maximum opening of the flame that is under greater thermal stress: this reinforces the hypothesis of the existence of a tube defect in this zone. As far as the possible coke detachment is concerned, the scientific literature says that in the visbreaking processes of the refineries there are undesired phenomena of asphaltenes precipitation due to incompatibility between the supply load and the derived products. These agglomeration phenomena are facilitated by the increase of the severity of the visbreaking process. It is important for this to better evaluate the chemical and physico-chemical characterisation of the fuel arriving in the refinery before processing it.",
        "Consequences": " RELATED TO PERSONS:\nThe personnel present at the plant were a head of shift, 2 workers and 4 operators, of which none were injured as results from the internal report.\n   RELATED TO MATERIAL:\nThe oven has been damaged in its interior due to the high temperature reached in the combustion chamber (about 1000 degrees Celsius and thus much higher than the design temperature of 495 degrees Celsius). About 100 tubes had to be replaced and it was necessary to revise the external control devices.\nAffected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of:       Ecological component: residential area (covered by toxic cloud) - Affected 3",
        "Emergency response": "Inside the establishmentInitial controlled shut down controlled by the emergency intervention team. Successive rapid shut down and the following operations:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - fuels interception at the limit of the battery,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - interception of feed line at the limit of the battery and deviation of the residue to another line,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - vacuum 3 to storage,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - opening of the vapour screen with Soaker inlet,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - opening water screen between the oven and the plant near the catalytic desulphurisation plant,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - circulation interruption of overheated oil, and feed of the accumulation to flare&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - control of columns pressure by motorised drainage valve to flare.Extinguishing of external fire by foam, extinguishing of internal fire (by the consumption of the fuel, closing of the incoming air and the action of suffocating vapour) and cooling of the external structure of the oven with the support of the Ancona fire brigade.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: The company in its technical note suggests:- in order to guarantee a complete monitoring of the temperature profile across the tube metal in the various zones of the oven to install a number of the skin points (thermocouples) along the oven,- verification with the licensing society of the process of the operating conditions and of the emergency procedures adopted in order to verify their efficiency,- re-design of the dimensions of the combustion system to fit the actual operating capacity of the oven."

        "Finish Date": "2000-10-23 13:25:00",
        "Accident Description": "During the shut-down of the titanium oxide (TiO2) installation an inspection of the level measurement device of the titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) evaporator was carried out. On disconnecting the signal wiring of the level measurement device the proces computer responded to this signal as empty and opened the control valve to fill the evaporator. The evaporator wasn't isolated prior to the start of the work (ineffective work permit system), so the evaporator started to fill with TiCl4, without anyone noticing. Meanwhile the work continued and the level measurement device was removed. The workers observed excess vapors to continue their work and went to the control room to check the vacuum system. At this moment the evaporator overflowed releasing TiCl4 on the second and first level of the reactor building (open floor around the evaporator). TiCl4 produces HCl ant TiO2 on contact with water (including air humidity), so rapidly a thick toxic white cloud formed inside the reactor building. Two contractors that were working on the first floor didn't manage to locate an emergency ladder near their workplace and tried to evacuate to the stairs they used to enter the building. Both were new to the installation and due to the vicinity of the release to the stairs, they were trapped in an unknown installation with almost zero visibility (thick white cloud). Both were found dead by search parties afterwards.\nSome of the emergency responders (company and community) were treated for minor chemical burns.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Defective work permit system - the installation was not isolated prior to the work.\nDefective information system for contractor workers - victims didn't recieve safety information about the installation ( they didn't use the safe evacuation route).\n\nNo interlock system to prevent overflow of evaporator.\nThe high level alarm was silenced by the panel operator without action.",
        "Consequences": "2 deaths\nSeveral injured, including 2 firefighters\n\nRoads surrounding the facility were closed and neighbouring inhabitants were sheltered in place.\nNeighbouring plant was evacuated.",
        "Emergency response": "On-site emergency team started the search for the leak and the missing victims.\nExternal firefighting service assisted in fighting the toxic cloud (16 persons).\nSeveral police units blocked roads and alerted neighbouring inhabitants.Legal action: yes, still in progress",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Work permit system has to be used strictly, adequate training and supervision necessary.\nA difference between no signal and zero signal should be made in the process computer.\nPrompt alert of external emergency services is necessary.\nContractors cannot be trusted to inform their personnel about the on-site safety information, a strict control system is necessary.\nMany employees evacuate to the control room, which adds to the work load of panel operators.\nA management crisis team is necessary to ensure communications with external emergency services.\n"

        "Finish Date": "2000-02-21 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident occurred in a foundry. Six persons were injured by the explosion of the furnace.The establishment is not classified as a Seveso plant, but the accident has certain characteristics (conditions of furnace explosion, effects...) which may be of interest and which may provide information that is relevant to other installations of the same type.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The main factual data relative to the circumstances are as follows :&nbsp;- The level of the metal bath was abnormally high. The furnace-operator had to raise the level of the dam and slightly incline the furnace spout.&nbsp;- Solid products came to the surface of the metal bath when oxygen was being blown in.&nbsp;- The furnace-man noted unmelted parts in the bottom of the furnace (by testing with a metal rod) a few minutes before the accident.&nbsp;- There were no unmelted elements attached to the sides of the furnace.&nbsp;- The average thickness of the arch bricks was measured at 180mm. The new brick is 250mm thick.&nbsp;- A few bricks of the arch's outer row were found on the periphery of the arch's metal ring.&nbsp;- A sample of metal ejected by the furnace door was analysed :.&nbsp;- The examination of the off-gas recorder on the stack outlet highlights the rapid increase of CO content at the time of the accident.&nbsp;- No water leak was reported in the cooling systems and the refractory material of the hearth was in very good condition.&nbsp;- While the load remaining in the furnace was melting after the accident, melting difficulties and rapid temperature increases to 1,700\u00b0 C followed by abrupt drops to 1,550\u00b0 C were noted. The temperature rise/drop phenomenon was noted 2 to 3 times. This phenomenon is interpreted by the dissolution of unmelted products in the bottom of the furnace and their rise to the top.Based on testimony by the personnel, reconstruction of the previous casting operation through to just after the accident, and post-accident investigations, some hypotheses relative to the phenomenon observed were presented. After analysis, some of them were finally rejected (Water leak inside the furnace, presence of a hollow body, collapse of the arch, collapse of unmelted elements attached to the side of the furnace, water present in the slag tank).On the other hand, the following causes have been retained :&nbsp;- The nickeled sand in the bottom of the furnace did not melt completely; the intense mixing of the metal by the injection of gaseous oxygen helped the nickeled sand rise to the surface. The nickel oxide was deoxidised by passing through the metal; the oxygen thus released combined with the carbon present in the bath and produced large quantities of CO and CO2 very rapidly. This hypothesis is substantiated by the recording of the gas analysers; a calculation shows that this reaction produces 73 m3 of CO in a few seconds.&nbsp;- The unmelted nickel sand in the bottom of the furnace contained a certain quantity of water and gas, held under pressure by a layer of pasty metal. The blast would have been due to the release of these during the fusion operation was an aggravating factor in the number of people injured. gases; a calculation shows that this phenomenon generates 8 m3 of steam.&nbsp;- The analysis of the causes concludes that the loading method (nickeled sand in the bottom of the furnace) was the origin of the accident.The presence of personnel not necessarily required around the furnace aggravated the consequences of the accident in term of human victims.",
        "Consequences": "6 persons were hospitalised; 2 of them, with severe burns, were taken to a specialised hospital in Lyon, while 3 were able to leave the hospital on the same evening. Another person suffered minor injuries. All of these persons were hit by molten metal or by very hot dust, or were touched by flames.",
        "Emergency response": "At the time of the accident, the operators alerted the emergency services and cut the electricity supply and the oxygen feed.An \"urgent\" prefect's decree was promulgated on 28 February 2000, requiring an identification of the causes and consequences as well as the implementation of the preventive measures before any resumption of the operation of furnace No. 2.The inspectorate requires the preparation of an expert's assessment by a specialised organisation which is independent of the company, on the following three topics:- The probable causes of the accident,- An overview of accidents in this sector of industrial activities, and the reasons why the identified causes are considered as likely;- The types of batches or castings which the application for a start-up will refer to. That application will be evaluated on the basis of risks and of the planned compensation measures.The operator presents a report on 24 March 2000. The expert's report is presented on 27 March 2000. The prefect's decree of 7 April 2000 authorises the operator to resume the operation of furnace No. 2 for the fusion of 3 groups of substances, according to the operational modes validated by the expert. The decree prescribes also the preparation of a modelling-study of the phenomena which led to the accident, as well as the updating of an update of the safety report (last version: September 1996).The modelisation study was conducted by the Laboratoire de Thermodynamique et de Physico-Chimie M\u00e9tallurgique at the Institut National Polytechnique of Grenoble, France. Based on small-scale tests (200g of sand, 1kg of cast iron), the study confirmed the scenario of a sudden release of gas due to the deoxidation of the nickel oxide contained in the sand.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The main lessons to learn from this accident may be summarised as follows:&nbsp;- The unexpected and uncontrolled reaction in the furnace is the origin of the accident.&nbsp;- The presence of people near the furnace at the time of the accident increased the human toll.&nbsp;-&nbsp; Adequate operating procedures are sufficient to prevent the occurrence of this kind of accidents.As a result, the operator had to take measures:&nbsp;- Modification of the area surrounding the furnace: protective panels for observation purposes and certain operations, the creation of circulation zones, regulated access near the furnace,&nbsp;- Revision of all the operating procedures, safety instructions (individual protective equipment ..),&nbsp;- Recruitment of a safety engineer for the site.The accident proved that basic precautions are required around a metallurgical furnace; in this instance, the routine, the poor understanding of the risks by the management and the operators allowed individuals to get into a dangerous situation."

The on-stream repair consisted in (see the drawing attached to the Original Report):\n- fabrication of a special bracket in two parts adapted to the dimensions of the flange of the valve;\n- injection of filling material in the bracket around the flange (the material had to be injected at a pressure higher than the operating pressure inside the pipe).\nDuring the repair some stud bolts broke causing the escape of a jet of a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen at 250 bars. The escaping mixture exploded, killing 2 workers.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nInvestigation revealed that two causes have probably contributed to the accident:\n1- the flange stud-bolts of the valve have been replaced by others made of a material not equivalent to the one originally specified;\n2- the maintenance company performing the repair have not taken into account the overpressure on the stud-bolts due to the injection of the filling material in the bracket.",

The charge was formed only by a solid part (thioridazine hydrochloride a \"neuroleptic\") with any heating of the reactor and without a previous charge of solvent (methanol and acetone) which was supposed to be added successively. The explosion occurred in correspondence with the feedbox causing the injury (wounding) of the operator which was pouring the thioridazine hydrochloride from a sack in the feedbox . Also other workers were affected by the accident, a second worker which was holding the sack and three (3) other workers which were performing other operations linked with the reaction process a few meters away from the explosion point. The room affected by the explosion was closed by windows which broke due to the explosion.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Some of the possible causes can be:- residues from a former process due to an incomplete cleaning of the vessel;- ignition of the explosion due to the presence of electrostatic charges;- wrong (incorrect) application of the loading (charging procedures) of the reactor by the operators.",
        "Consequences": "5 operators were involved (affected) by the accident: the operator in charge with the loading operation, equipped with a facial mask and anti-dust gloves&nbsp; has been burnt in different parts,&nbsp; most seriously on an arm; the operator in charge with lifting the drum (sack) suffered from skin irritation (reddening) and blackening of the face; the other three operators have suffered from superficial burns on their heads and part of their hair was burned.The device (reactor) was slightly damaged and it is planned to use it again after appropriate modifications.The reactor is made of a pressure vessel in stainless steel type 316 with a capacity of 3600 litres with a cylindrical shell (coat) with two convex bottoms having a vertical axis and a heating coil (serpentine).The explosion has also caused the rupture of some nearby windows.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "Emergency response operation by the internal fire fighting service onsite and request of an ambulance through the 118 telephone service, which has also alerted the fire brigades.

        "Causes of the accident": "The input substances (sodium hydroxide (NaOH), metal surface treatment agent, sodium cyanide (NaCN)) were added to the basin in the above order while small amounts of residual rinsing water were still present in the basin.The work instructions in force were therefore not adhered to.This led to an exothermic reaction (heat of dilution) of the NaOH with the residual rinsing water.Because of the layering of the substances added, sufficient heat removal was not possible. An isolated heat island below the NaCN led to the ignition/decomposition of the metal surface treatment agent.Planned simultaneous addition of more de-mineralised water to fill the basin (which, through heat removal, would have prevented a reaction between the NaOH and the residual rinsing water up to ignition point) was not possible because of a defective solenoid valve.\nOperating staff deviated from the predefined work instructions in order to make it more feasible to add solids to the basin filled with de-mineralised water and to prevent the vat contents from splashing because of the partially clumped NaCN.",
        "Consequences": "Production facilities:Total loss of production facilities in the fire area.\nBuilding:Total loss of building technology in the fire area.Severe impact on the remaining production facilities and the building, including building technology, due to extremely corrosive smoke.Damage to production facilities and infrastructure due to smoke and heat.",

        "Lesson Learned": "The workability of all procedures for filling treatment vats in which multiple input substances are used has been checked. Any detected shortcomings in their safe and workable implementation have been eliminated via technical or organisational measures. These include upgrading manual valves for the supply of de-mineralised water, provision of equipment to improve ergonomics and handling of work equipment and substances, and introducing checklists for operating staff in order to safeguard procedures.All corresponding processes then underwent clearance.\nA standard for the technical design of basin-filling devices has been defined and implemented.Staff in the production and planning departments have been trained.The measures taken by the operator to secure vat contents and the processes and rules implemented at the company have been verified by external experts approved under Section&nbsp;29b of the Federal Immission Control Act (BImSchG).The potential minor improvements identified have been implemented / are being implemented.\nSubstances were not dispensed in the order provided for in the existing written work instructions. The result was an exothermic reaction. This shows how important it is to regularly and exhaustively communicate and supervise adherence to work instructions.\nThe use of a CO2 fire extinguisher (foam extinguishers were available as well) caused a reaction with the NaCN, generating toxic HCN (hydrogen cyanide).This shows that it is necessary to better prepare staff for handling operational malfunctions."

This estimated 10 m3 release corresponds to 130 kg of hydrazine hydrate, 70 kg of aminotriazole and 5.6 t of aminoguanidine formiate.The workshop was secured. To limit the consequences of this kind of release, the operator partially confined the pollution inside the plant's lagoons while lowering the rate of release into the natural environment (300 m3/hr instead of 800) and feeding clean water (900 m3/hr) into the Petite Baise to dilute the pollutant. Bleach (sodium hypochloride) was used to neutralize the hydrazine hydrate in the drainage pipes. The releases from the lagoons fell below the pollution threshold again after about ten days.The accident occurred during start-up after a routine operation to steam-clean lines and batch production equipment in order to remove the accumulated crystals of finished products. The accident was caused by leaving the connecting valves between the line connected to the steam system and the drainage system open when restarting. The steam injection system using pipes with bleeders dates from 2004 and replaced the previous system which used flexible hoses deemed hazardous for operators. This modification was not subjected to strict change management at the time, as required by the safety management system.In addition, a design fault in the steam-cleaning system, failing to separate the production circuit from the unpolluted water system, is also to blame.To avoid this type of accident recurring, the steam injection lines have been modified and the operators have been trained on best practices.This accident should be notified because the 130 kg of hydrazine hydrate released into the environment corresponds to 6.5% of the Seveso threshold for the substance (T+). This accident is characterized on the European accident gravity scale:- at level 3 for hazardous materials released (130 kg&nbsp; of hydrazine hydrate released into the environment corresponds to 6.5% of the Seveso threshold for the substance),- at level 1 for the environmental consequences (pollution of surface water)",

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The accident occurred during the production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) in a reactor heated with steam at a temperature of 165-175\u00b0C. The reaction was carried out without ad adequate addition of ammonia and therefore the normal small hydrogen chloride production could not be compensated. Hence, the excess of hydrogen chloride destabilized the suspension of PVC-latex which coagulated. The coagulation of the latex caused the mixer failure but there was no indication of it. Consequently, a local overheating resulted and a decomposition on PVC occurred because the steam temperature (165-175\u00b0C) was higher that the PVC decomposition temperature (144\u00b0C). Being the PVC decomposition exothermic, the heat caused an expansion of coagulated latex clogged all the pipings including the inlet to the bursting disc and to the safety valve. The uncompensated hydrogen chloride started to react with the material&nbsp; of the reactor (the Duplex stainless steel was not resistant against hydrogen chloride at high temperatures). Though the steam supply had been stopped and the external cooling started (activated by the release of hot gases from the reactor), the vessel burst because the wall thickness was reduced from 9.8 mm to 2 mm. Activation of the sprinkler system enhanced reactor cooling and diluted the hydrogen chloride vapours.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:Due to a human error, PVC-latex with insufficient ammonia was used, resulting in the coagulation of the suspension. It caused the agitator failure (there were no indication of its failure) and therefore a not detected local overheating occurred.

The concentration of hydrogen chloride in air was measured outside the establishment but no gas was detected at a distance of approximately 1,000 metres from the plant because the release of the gases from the reactor activated the sprinkler system, resulting in cooling of the vessel and dilution of the hot mixture that reduced the emission rate of hydrogen chloride into the environment.Material loss - Remarks: The cost of the material damages to the reactor and to the plant caused by the explosion has been estimated at about 0.45M Euros).Disruption of community life: In the Original Report there is no evidence of effects outside the establishment. The concentration of hydrogen chloride in air was measured outside the establishment but no gas was detected at a distance of approximately 1,000 metres from the plant because the release of gases from the reactor activated the sprinkler system, resulting in cooling of the vessel and dilution of the hot mixture that reduced the emission rate of hydrogen chloride into the environment.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Though the steam supply was stopped and the external cooling of the reactor was applied (the hot gases released from the vessel activated the sprinkler system), the local weakening of the vessel wall around the steam inlet (thickness was reduced from 9.8 mm to 2 mm due to the hydrogen chloride attack) was too fast to prevent the physical explosion of the reactor.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The concentration of hydrogen chloride in air was measured outside the establishment but no gas was detected at a distance of approximately 1,000 metres from the plant because the release of gases from the reactor activated the sprinkler system, resulting in cooling of the vessel and dilution of the hot mixture that reduced the emission rate of hydrogen chloride into the environment.Therefore, no off-site emergency measures were necessary. No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:1- substitution of the plasticizing agent and use of steam with a maximum temperature of 127\u00b0C (latex starts decomposing at 140\u00b0C);2- installation of a double signalling device on the mixer for the detection of malfunctions;3- interlock of the steam supply to the mixer so that the steam supply will be automatically shut off in the case of agitator failure;4- installation of two independent temperature sensors. The steam supply will be automatically shut off if any of the sensors indicates a temperature above 100\u00b0C or when there is a substantial difference in indications of the two sensors;5- installation of a level switch which will automatically shut off the steam supply when a high level in the reactor is reached;6- installation of a pressure switch (set at 1 bar overpressure) which will automatically shut off the steam supply when a high pressure is reached;7- all these steam shut off actions to be coupled to an alarm signal in control room;8- batch control on quality, pH and persulphate contents to be introduced;9- during the process the pH to be monitored through regular sampling; the possibility of continuous pH-monitoring to be investigated."

        "Accident Description": "SUMMARYAt approximately 14.00 on Sunday 9th April there was an explosion followed by a fire at the Distillation Unit 1. The specific distillation column K23 was shut down at the time of the incident for scheduled maintenance when a heat exchanger exploded and the cumene ignited. The automatic systems for foaming were activated and the on-site emergency services were quickly on the scene. They were joined by the external emergency services. The fire was extinguished at 15.23. &nbsp;Two firemen were taken to hospital having come into contact with cumene, a mild irritant. They were released following check-up and have suffered no long-term effects. There was no environmental issue outside of the plant area and there was no risk to the local community. It was found that there was an unexpected accumulation of methyl hydroperoxide (MHP) in the upper part of column K23 during normal operation. During the shut down of the column, the MHP was enriched in the aqueous side draw. Because of specific circumstances parts of this water could flow into the hot heat exchanger, where a thermal explosion of the MHP containing liquid led to an over pressurization of the apparatus. The explosion tore off the feed and outlet pipes. Cumene mainly leaked from the long pipe towards a buffer tank and ignited. &nbsp;Cumene is a colorless, flammable liquid.INCIDENT DESCRIPTIONOn Sunday April 9th K23 was being shutdown in order to perform a regulatory inspection of the column reboiler.&nbsp; The shutdown of K23 was being conducted as outlined in the procedure. The first focus in shutting down K23 was stopping the feed and evacuating the bottom of the column. At 13.17, the feed to K23 from the Cumene Extraction Unit was stopped by closing a manual valve at the Cumene Extraction Unit.&nbsp; At approximately the same time, the level controller for the sump of K23 was placed in manual operation with a fixed valve position to allow K23 to be pumped empty to Tank 93. The level of K23's sump immediately began to decrease, reaching 10% by 13.19.&nbsp; The level remained stable at 10%, although material was continually pumped from K23.&nbsp; This is an indication that the level transmitter was not reporting correctly and that the actual level was below the lower nozzle of the level instrument.&nbsp; Based on calculations, it is estimated that approximately 1 m3 of material remained in K23 below the lower nozzle of its level instrument.&nbsp; At 13.25, K23's bottom pump began to cavitate, indicating that the column was nearly empty, and was shut down at 13.28.&nbsp; The bottoms product from K23 is cooled by the feed in a preheater (WBG2336).&nbsp; Having already shut off the feed to K23, there was no cooling of the bottoms product as indicated by a temperature rise on the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93. This temperature indicator reached a maximum temperature of 128 \u00b0C at 13.24, which is the same time that K23 was empty.The second focus in shutting down K23 was preventing low boiling components from entering the bottom of the column. To ensure that the low boiling components remained in the overheads of the column, the steam flow controller was placed in manual operation at 13.19 and steam input was reduced over a three-minute period.&nbsp; At 13.25 the steam condensate temperature increased indicating that heat transfer was no longer taking place due to K23's sump being empty.&nbsp; At 13.29, the steam flow was stopped by placing the controller at 0% output.&nbsp; The interface level in BBG2305 began increasing at 13.25, indicating the accumulation of additional water in this vessel.&nbsp; This level increase was a combined result of shutting off the steam flow to K23 and continuing to reflux material from BBG2303 to the top of K23.&nbsp; At 13.39, the reflux flow controller was placed in manual operation at 0% output.&nbsp; At 13.54, BBG2305's level controller was placed in manual control at a fixed valve position of 10%.&nbsp; The outlet flow from BBG2305 was estimated to be 25 liter/min and resulted in a continuous decrease of the aqueous level in BBG2305.&nbsp; At 13.58, the aqueous level in BBG2305 went to 0%, indicating that organic material was then being pumped from BBG2305 to Tank 93.At approximately 14.00 an explosion occurred at WBG2336, which resulted in a fire in the South West corner of Distillation Unit 1. The sprinkler and foam systems for Distillation Unit 1 were immediately activated. The site emergency response team quickly responded to the incident and was later joined by outside emergency services. The fire could not be extinguished until 15.23 due to being unable to successfully isolate fuel sources from the fire.",
        "Causes of the accident": "FAILURE ANALYSISThe explosion occurred at WBG2336, which is a spiral heat exchanger that is used to heat up the feed to K23 by cooling down the bottom product.&nbsp; During normal operation the feed is heated and the bottoms product is cooled from 145 \u00b0C.&nbsp; The feed to K23 enters WBG2336 at the side and exits at the top (cold side of the heat exchanger). The bottom product from K23 enters WBG2336 at the bottom and exits at the side (hot side of the heat exchanger).&nbsp; During the modified operation the aqueous side draw from BBG2305 was added to the exit of this stream. Based on the inspection of WBG2336, it was determined that the failure resulted from the over pressurization in the hot side of the heat exchanger. The spiral failed at a pressure between 10 and 15 barg. Such a pressure could be reached by for example a gas explosion. Four scenarios were identified during the incident investigation as possible causes of the over pressurization. The scenarios are as follows:\"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thermal Expansion occurring during a blocked in condition\"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CHP spontaneously decomposing within the exchanger\"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MHP slowly decomposing to form hydrogen and oxygen thereby creating an atmosphere which at only low activation energy could lead to an explosion \"&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MHP spontaneously decomposing within the exchanger.Thermal ExpansionDuring the shut down of the column there were several manual valves closed in order to isolate K23 from other processes. Therefore, the possibility for a blocked in condition of WBG2336 needed to be evaluated. The feed to WBG2336 was stopped by closing a manual valve (V1) in the Cumene Extraction Unit. After K23 had been emptied and the bottom pump was stopped, the manual valve (V2) at the discharge of the pump was closed. This isolated WBG2336 from the bottom of K23, but allowed for an opening at the outlet from WBG2336 to Tank 93.&nbsp; At this same time, the manual valve (V3) at the outlet of WBG2336 to K23 was also shut. Shortly after that, approximately 9 minutes, the operator realized that he had closed the wrong valve. At this point the operator opened the manual valve (V3) at the outlet of WBG2336 to K23 and closed the manual valve (V4) at the cold side inlet to WBG2336.&nbsp; A spike in the flow meter (FR82331) on the feed line to K23 provides an indication of this valve manipulation. Based on the short period of time of the blocked in condition and short duration of the associated flow spike, the pressure buildup was determined to be insufficient to cause damage to WBG2336. It was also determined that the severity of the damage to WBG2336 could not have been caused by thermal expansion.&nbsp; Therefore, this scenario was eliminated as a possible cause for the over pressurization of WBG2336.Spontaneous Decomposition of CHPDuring normal operation of K23, there is approximately 2% CHP in the feed to and bottom product from the column. Due to the highly reactive nature of CHP, the possibility of spontaneous decomposition needed to be evaluated. An analysis of the material from the bottom of K23 at 10.00 on April 9th showed that the CHP content was 1.43%, which was in line with expected values. An analysis of a sample from the feed line to WBG2336 following the incident indicated that the CHP content was 0.92%, which was slightly below the expected value.&nbsp; Based on testing it is known that even at a temperature of 140 \u00b0C, no instantaneous decomposition of 2% CHP would occur. In a weak acid system, pH &gt; 2, CHP would decompose mainly to DMPC and ACP through thermal decomposition. It would also decompose partially to phenol and acetone through acid catalyzed decomposition. Based on this information the spontaneous decomposition of CHP was eliminated as a possible scenario for the over pressurization of WBG2336.MHP Decomposition to Hydrogen and OxygenDuring normal operation, there was approximately 0.2% MHP in the feed, 0.1% in the bottom product, and below 3% in the aqueous phase of K23's side draw.&nbsp; A partial decomposition of MHP to methanol and hydrogen was expected in K23 based on operating experience.&nbsp; However, samples taken from the side draw receiver (BBG2305) and the overhead receiver (BBG2303) following the incident showed increased levels of MHP in both vessels.&nbsp; After the incident the MHP concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 were determined to be 28 and 8 % respectively. The pH figures of both liquids were below 3. Although it was known that the feed to column K23 contained only small amounts of MHP, it was not known that MHP could be concentrated in localized areas. A literature review on this topic identified only one case where increased MHP concentrations were linked to an explosion in a process for making surfactants. Due to the lack of physical properties for MHP, this condition is difficult to model. However, after making certain assumptions, a simulation for the operation of K23 could be performed. The simulation indicated that MHP could be concentrated in the upper section of the column in the aqueous phase and remain there during normal operation with a peak of around 7%.&nbsp; Obviously, as shown by the analysis of material in BBG2305 after the incident, the MHP was concentrated up to a much higher concentration. This was probably caused during specific shut down conditions at relatively high reflux ratios. The identified location of the MHP peak was between the top tray, where reflux is added to the column, and just above the side draw. Thus, the temperature profile and outlet configuration could allow for K23 to reach equilibrium with an area of localized high concentration of MHP in the top section and low concentrations in all of the outlet streams. K23 is designed so that all liquid contained above the side draw is directed to BBG2305. Therefore, when K23 is shut down and its contents are allowed to flow into the bottom, the concentrated MHP would flow into BBG2305 where it would be separated with the aqueous phase and be pumped to Tank 93. This condition is supported by the sample analysis from material in BBG2305 following the incident, which indicated MHP concentrations that were much higher than expected during normal operation. In addition to MHP the simulation showed a much lower peak for hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which was in the feed to the column, too. With a concentration of 20 wppm in the feed the estimated peak was 100 wppm besides the 7 % MHP. The H2O2 concentration in BBG2305 after the incident was determined to be 385 wppm besides 28 % MHP. As well as for MHP the calculated maximal concentration for H2O2 is lower than the analyzed figure, due to a probably higher accumulation during the shut down procedure. Normally, the cumene at the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93 is at a temperature of 35 \u00b0C.&nbsp; However, after the feed to K23 was stopped, the temperature of WBG2336 increased to at least 128 \u00b0C. This is indicated on the temperature indicator at the outlet of WBG2336 to Tank 93. A review of the piping configuration indicated that in addition to being exposed to the hot cumene exiting WBG2336, the aqueous phase, due to a difference in density, could also migrate into the hot side of the heat exchanger. The bottom section of WBG2336's hot side could be filled with aqueous material by displacement of the hot cumene. This displacement is indicated by a temperature increase from 109 \u00b0C to 134 \u00b0C on temperature indicator TR82374. Similarly, the top section of WBG2336's hot side could accumulate a vapor phase that could be generated through the decomposition of MHP. Since the hot side of WBG2336 was not equipped with a vent line, this vapor phase would accumulate down to the side outlet of the heat exchanger from where it would then begin to flow into the transfer line to Tank 93.&nbsp; Based on mechanical drawings, it is estimated that the maximum volume of vapor that would accumulate in WBG2336 would be 175 liters.&nbsp; Following a discussion with specialists in the field of explosion testing, it is now known that vapor phases containing hydrogen concentrations in the range of 16% to 90%, with the remainder being composed of oxygen, could be ignited with minimal energy input and a detonation would occur.&nbsp; Under these conditions, even small explosive gas volumes could result in excessive localized pressure upon ignition. Due to the elevated level of MHP in the system, the formation of an explosive atmosphere with hydrogen and oxygen, resulting from the decomposition of MHP, needed to be evaluated, as the review of the system indicated no path for oxygen to enter the system from the atmosphere. The Limiting Oxygen Concentration (LOC) for hydrogen is 4.3 Vol% at normal conditions. Taking into account the higher temperature in the heat exchanger, the LOC was around 3.8 Vol%. A hydrogen containing gas atmosphere with more than 4 Vol % of hydrogen is only explosive if at the same time the oxygen concentration is above the LOC.Based on a few former investigations, it was known that MHP decomposes to hydrogen. The reaction is relatively fast at a high pH and low at a pH below 7. The reaction is enhanced by adding formaldehyde to the MHP containing solution, but again only hydrogen is formed. Oxygen could only be formed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which is present in the aqueous stream (2) from BBD0020. The concentration of&nbsp; H2O2 in the cumene stream (1), which was the feed to K23, was analyzed to be below 20 wppm. The H2O2 concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 were determined to be 385 and 50 wppm respectively, besides the much higher MHP concentrations of 28 % and 8 % respectively. Based on this a simultaneous formation of significant amounts of oxygen from H2O2 besides hydrogen formation from MHP was very unlikely. To verify the mechanism of hydrogen formation from MHP and to exclude a simultaneous formation of critical amounts of oxygen at low pH, several decomposition tests were made. The tests were made with the MHP and H2O2 containing stream (2), as well as with the liquid from BBG2305, taken after the incident. The tests were made in a special adiabatic calorimeter (Vent Sizing Package calorimeter VSP). Around 65 ml were filled in a 110 ml vessel, which was then closed and set under a slight vacuum. The vessel was heated until the thermal decomposition occurred and the content heated up itself under adiabatic conditions. The vessel was cooled down to around ambient temperature and a gas sample was taken. The analyzed gas concentrations were corrected to take into account preliminary air content from slight vacuum. At each test a double gas analysis was made. No peroxides could be analyzed from the remaining liquid, thus there was always a total decomposition. In addition to the gas analysis, such calorimetric tests deliver information about reaction heat and reaction dynamics, see chapter 4.4. In case of a very violent reaction (runaway) the VSP vessel bursts and the content is released to a secondary compartment, which is filled with nitrogen. Ten tests (run 1 to 10) were made.Runs 1 to 6 were made with the MHP and H2O2 containing stream (2) from the process, at different pH. In general, mainly hydrogen is formed in an amount of 25 to 35&nbsp; mol% of the initial amount of MHP. That fits very well to the operational experience of Thermi I. The amount of oxygen varies with the pH. At a low pH, only 20 mol% in maximum of the H2O2 are converted to oxygen. That is not surprising, because in the presence of MHP, formaldehyde is formed which reacts with H2O2 to form hydrogen, too. In contrast, the formation of oxygen from H2O2 is around 100 % at a pH of 7. At a higher pH the formation of oxygen from H2O2 is again reduced. From these test runs a reaction heat of around 340 kJ per mol MHP could be determined. The activation energy of the decomposition reaction is around 120 kJ/mol. These figures indicate that the decomposition reaction is highly exothermic and increases rapidly with increasing temperature. The gas formation is around 12.4 ln (standard norm liter) per mol MHP. Runs 7 to 10 were made with the MHP containing stream from BBG2305. As already mentioned above, only small amounts of H2O2 (385 wppm) were in this stream. Run 7 was made with a diluted sample to be able to get gas samples. Unfortunately the gas analysis failed, but from the exothermic reaction a similar reaction heat was found, as in the tests before. Run 8 was made with a higher concentrated MHP solution of 15.8 %. The reaction behaviour of a solution with such a higher MHP concentration is also described in a Japanese paper. As expected, the calorimeter burst and the content was released into the secondary compartment. A gas sample could not be taken. The results from this test about reaction dynamics of such a higher concentrated MHP solution will be discussed in chapter 4.4. Runs 9 and 10 were made again with a lower concentrated solution to get reliable gas concentrations from the decomposition. Again it could be shown that mainly hydrogen is formed besides small and uncritical amounts of oxygen.For all tests an analyzed concentration of lower than 0.5 Vol% oxygen should be considered as an inaccuracy of taking and analyzing the gas samples. Significant higher concentrations could only be found from decomposition of solutions with significant amounts of H2O2, see runs 1 to 6. As only small amounts of H2O2 were present in the side stream from K23 besides a high concentration of MHP, the decomposition could only lead to low concentrations of oxygen, see runs 9 to 10. The decomposition of such a solution could not lead to an explosive gas atmosphere. The oxygen concentration would have been always below the Limiting Oxygen Concentration of 3.8 Vol%. Based on these results, the formation of an explosive gas atmosphere and a successive ignition was eliminated as a possible scenario for the over pressurisation of WBG2336. Nevertheless it will be recommended to develop guidelines for proper handling of liquids containing MHP and/or H2O2 to prevent any accumulation of flammable atmosphere.Spontaneous Decomposition of MHPAs stated in the previous section, normal MHP concentrations are relatively low throughout the system and a partial decomposition of MHP to methanol and hydrogen was expected in K23 based on operating experience. Samples taken from the system, following the incident indicated MHP concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 as 28 and 8 % respectively.&nbsp; Due to the elevated level of MHP in the system, the spontaneous decomposition of MHP, leading to a thermal explosion, needed to be evaluated.&nbsp; A thermal explosion of a reactive liquid, what is also called a runaway reaction, leads to a temperature and pressure increase due to the heat and gas formation, all effects increasing exponentially with increasing temperature. As already described in the previous section, the MHP concentration in the column could be concentrated in the upper section of the column in the aqueous phase and remain there during normal operations. Therefore, when K23 was shut down, the concentrated MHP could flow into BBG2305 where it was separated with the aqueous phase and pumped to Tank 93. As described in the previous section, this aqueous material could migrate to WBG2336 and filled the bottom section of the exchanger's hot side after stopping the pump PBG2300. Based on the temperature indication at the outlet of the hot side, it is known that this area was at a temperature of at least 128 \u00b0C.&nbsp; At this temperature, it was known that MHP will thermally decompose.&nbsp; However, both the decomposition velocity, nor the amount of energy that would be generated by this elevated concentration of MHP, were not known yet. The test run 8, was made with a solution of 15.8 % MHP and took place under adiabatic conditions. The test showed a continuous increase of temperature up to 180\u00b0C and an increase of pressure because of gas formation. At this temperature, the pressure was around 20 bar and the vessel burst. From this test the kinetics of the MHP decomposition could be evaluated, which allows to calculate the temperature and pressure increase over time for adiabatic conditions and various conditions regarding MHP concentration and starting temperature. Based on the reaction heat of 340 kJ/mol, an aqueous solution would heat up with around 17\u00b0C per one percent decomposed MHP under adiabatic conditions. The Japanese paper, presents some results from decomposition tests of MHP solutions up to 16.3 %. A reaction heat of 341 kJ/mol MHP was found, what is very similar to the results from the own investigations. For the 16.3 % MHP solution a maximal heat rate of around 20\u00b0C per second is reported in the Japanese paper, what was the maximal detection rate in that test apparatus. From the experiment at Degussa with a 15.8% MHP solution a heat rate of 30\u00b0C per second was detected, just before the vessel burst at 180\u00b0C. Thus, for the same MHP concentration the decomposition rate of the side draw from K23 was similar or even higher than reported in the Japanese paper. &nbsp;It is now very likely, that the following scenario happened: At around 13.28, when K23's bottom pump was stopped, the aqueous phase could flow into WBG2336 by displacing hot cumene. The aqueous phase from K23's side draw vessel BBG2305 had a temperature of around 70\u00b0C. Hot cumene was displaced and flowed to Tank 93, As already mentioned, this was indicated by the temperature increase from 109 \u00b0C to 134 \u00b0C by the indicator TR82374. After reaching this maximum at 13.39, the temperature dropped down to finally 106 \u00b0C at 14.00. In maximum, the lower part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger could be filled up with the aqueous phase, what was around 155 liters. By initial gas formation from MHP decomposition, hydrogen could accumulate in the upper part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger. The aqueous phase could heat up in contact with the hot cumene and the hot steel from the heat exchanger, as well as by MHP decomposition, until it started to boil. The pressure in the heat exchanger was around 0.7 barg, coming from the backpressure of Tank 93. The boiling point of pure water at this pressure is 115\u00b0C. But as the aqueous phase contained light boilers like MHP, acetone and methanol, the boiling point was lower, probably around 106\u00b0C, which was finally indicated by TR82374. First the vapor could accumulate, besides hydrogen, in the upper part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger and then had to release to the line towards Tank 93. The initial MHP concentration in the aqueous phase from BBG2305 was probably below 3 %, as it was from normal operation of K23. After the incident the MHP concentration in BBG2305 was 28 %. It is assumed, that the mean concentration in the heat exchanger was finally 15 %, what is approximately the average of these two figures. By evaporating, the heat from MHP decomposition could initially be discharged, until the thermal explosion occurred. Due to heat removal by evaporation at the beginning, the effective MHP concentration, which finally caused a thermal explosion, was lower. Nevertheless, the gas formation from 6 % MHP is already sufficient to exceed a pressure of 15 barg, what caused the failure of the heat exchanger. Form the kinetics a runaway of a 15 % MHP solution occurs within 100 seconds, starting at 106\u00b0C. At a temperature of more than 115\u00b0C, the pressure increase over time from gas formation is higher than 10 bars per second. Such a high pressure gradient could not be compensated by a release of the gas towards Tank 93, because the inertia of the liquid in the long pipe was too high.&nbsp; Consequently the heat exchanger burst, as it could not withstand a pressure of more than 15 barg. Based on these investigations, a thermal explosion (runaway) of a higher concentrated MHP solution is the cause for the over pressurisation of the spiral heat exchanger WBG2336.",

        "Accident Description": "On 17 July 2010 a pipeline compensator in an oil terminal broke down while a ship was being unloaded.\nA mixture of hydrocarbons (C5-C6 paraffin) of approx. 80 t was discharged. As it is a highly flammable substance, it was immediately covered with a foam carpet. Approx. 17.8 t of the amount discharged was soaked up; approx. 1.7 t evaporated into the air and approx. 5.3 t were skimmed off by the end of October 2010. The remaining amount (approx. 55 t) in the soil was siphoned off over a longer period of time using four skimming wells. The ship was loaded with approx. 500 t of the aforementioned liquid. After the entire pipeline had been checked by the operator's staff, samples of the liquid had been taken and analysed, and the routine unloading processes had been discussed with the ship\u2019s master, the unloading process began around 01:30.\nThe ship's pump was started at a capacity of 50 m3/h and a pressure of 1.5 bar. Around 01:45, the ship's pump broke down twice, for reasons that are still unknown. At 02:45 the operator's employee had the capacity increased to 100 m3/h. As the estimated tank content differed significantly from the actual tank content, at around 03:10 the operator moved away from the pipeline route and observed a large organic liquid pool.\nAt around 03:12 the employee halted the unloading of the ship.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause of the discharge was identified as a rupture around the entire circumference of a port pipeline compensator through which the highly flammable liquid flowed into a pipeline transportation system. The failure of the ship\u2019s pump, the reasons for which could not be identified, led to a hydraulic pressure surge in the pipeline. Since the compensators fitted are not suitable for this application and there was no fixed point between two compensators, the compression/extension acting on the compensators was not clearly defined. The system was thus insecure. The result was a rupture around the entire circumference of one compensator and damage to the adjacent compensator.\n",
        "Consequences": "Material damage: Compensator in pipeline\nEnvironmental damage: Soil contamination\nTotal costs for removal and clean-up approx. \u20ac480 000.\n",

The accident is notified for the technical relevance of certain aspects of the occurrence.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The filtering cakes are made of sulphurised organic material which by anaerobic fermentation releases hydrogen sulphide and methane. The generation and release of such substances is not avoidable.The meteorological conditions (heavy rains) during the weeks before the occurrence prevented turning over of the pile, according to the operator. The anaerobic fermentation process was thus favoured. These high humidity conditions significantly increased the production of H2S. The water tightness of the storage area, carried out in order to recover the draining liquid confined the gas in the drainage system located under the geomembrane.The automatic control of the draining trap pump makes it possible to maintain the level of the liquid below the level of the draining system. The measurements performed by the operator showed H2S concentration of at least 500 ppm (measurement limit of the detector employed). The assumption of a gas pocket formed in the drainage system, which may have been freed through the intervention of the two employees and then released into the atmosphere over a drain pipe during the preliminary drainage of the draining trap has not been verified, given that dangerous H2S concentrations were reached anyhow.",
        "Consequences": "Following the disconnection of the output pipe of the draining trap pump two workers intervened and started emptying the draining trap. They then entered the drain trap in unspecified conditions (there were no witnesses to the accident). Alarm was raised three hours later when the non-return of the two workers was noticed; the workers were found on the bottom of the drain trap.",
        "Emergency response": "No action is executed before the discovering of the 2 people died.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Considering the H2S and CH4 concentrations measured and the relating hazards (toxicity and explosiveness), on 26th February 2001 the Inspectorate for Classified Installations (DRIRE) proposed issuing a series of urgent prefectoral orders aiming at classifying the storage area as a controlled zone and the areas around the draining trap and the waste gas vent as danger zones, defining the procedures in case of intervention (access limitation, preliminary measurements of the atmosphere...)The operator has already planned modification of the discharge pipe of the pump in such way that accessing the draining traps will not be necessary. This modification will be carried out after authorisation of the judicial authority in charge of the investigation.Besides immediate measures to be taken with respect to the probable causes of the accident, the Inspectorate for Classified Installations is studying longer term technical changes to minimise the hazards caused by the unavoidable formation of these gases.For this reason the Inspectorate has asked the operator to study and propose feasible measures to optimise the management procedures of the filter cake storage (amounts produced, storage time, aeration frequencies of the piles) and to avoid areas of possible gas accumulation.The Classified Installations Inspectorate has also requested an updating of the Safety Report concerning all activities of the installation.The Classified Installations Inspectorate has also requested an updating of the Safety Report concerning all activities of the installation."

        "Accident Description": "An oil leak occurred at about 12 noon in the propylene compressor of the steam cracker at a petrochemical plant. The equipment's pumping system had exhibited problems, and was undergoing testing when a leak appeared in a branch pipe and burst into flame upon contact with hot walls. The internal teams shut down this equipment and also another that had become unstable. An external operator discovered the leak and alerted the platform's fire fighters, who arrived with five fire engines. The fire was extinguished, but oil leaked into the interstage below; despite the foam layer that had been put in place, a layer of oil caught fire in the piping 20 minutes later. The internal fire team extinguished the fire. The plant was shut down from the control room and the steam cracker degassed by flaring, creating an extensive flame and a column of black smoke. The oil spill was cleaned up and the effluent was channelled into a retention basin at the plant's internal water treatment facility. The oil-soaked lagging of some pipes was removed. The operator informed the Classified Installations Inspectorate, the prefecture and local municipalities, and issued a press release. Despite the slowing down of the steam cracker, the flaring episode lasted for 48 hours, the time required to eliminate the remaining production output and recalibrate the equipment. The damaged branch pipe (50 cm x 1\") had been added during a long shutdown a few months earlier, in order to facilitate the draining of the air/oil accumulators of the compressor (which make it possible to absorb shocks) in preparation for use. The breakage took place at the coupling thread of a shut-off valve. An analysis was carried out in order to determine the causes and circumstances of the breakage.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "The rupture at the connection thread of the \u00be inches oil pipe \u00be on an isolation valve, is due to a progressive fatigue cracking due to vibration appeared throughout the oil circuit.\nVibration and notch effect in the thread root (a 5 mm thread emerging largely beyond the useful engaged height which is approximately 10 mm) are the main factors behind the rupture. The low surface area occupied by the final rupture area shows that the stresses applied were relatively low; their thread root concentration (intensification factor constraints may be equal or greater than 10) has favored the appearance of cracks (several firings identified in the periphery of tubing).\n",

        "Accident Description": "Overpressure was detected in the gas storage on the morning of 27 May 2020.The cause was a suddenly rising floating layer which blocked all gas outlets. As a result, biogas could no longer overflow into the neighbouring containers. The overpressure relief system was likewise blocked by the floating material.Turning on the (emergency) biogas flare did not release the pressure, meaning that ultimately the gas hood could not withstand the increasing pressure and burst.The biogas contained in the gas storage escaped.\nSafety measures:\u2018Overpressure in gas storage\u2019 warning message activated, (emergency) gas flare activated but did not lead to a release of pressure, overpressure relief system technically in working order but blocked.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause for the release of substances into the atmosphere was a rising floating layer in the digestate store, which blocked all gas outlets.",

        "Causes of the accident": "The vent system (a four inch pipeline of about 240 feet long) was used to clean a vessel. The purpose of the vessel was to ad AlCl3 to the process. The vessel had to be cleaned with water because of problems in the normal process. The vessel was situated at a level of about 60 feet high. In order to ad water to the vessel the pipeline was used. At ground level the pipe was disconnected and a cast iron Saunders valve was attached. The fire water system was attached to the Saunders valve. Not very well known was the fact that in the pipeline were quantities of AlCl3 and TiCl4 as a deposit. The water and the deposit caused rapid reactions. The rapid pressure rise had the force of an explosion, but the pressure itself did not exceed the burst pressure of the pipe. This is proved because of the fact that longitudinal cracks did not develop. The fast pressure was transmitted in all directions. As mentioned before the pipe resisted the pressure in circumferential and of course also in longitudinal directions. But the pressure (probably a pressure wave) was directly transmitted through the water to the end, where the Saunders valve was situated, in almost completely closed position. The pressure wave resulted in a brittle failure of the Saunders valve housing. As a result of the thrust of the water and the vapour, expelled at a high speed, induces strong reaction forces on the pipe, resulting in a pipe whip and so destroying the pipeline in several parts.The loosening of the pipe end and the vertical ends of the pipeline in which water was able to form a kind of blockage, may have played a role in the accident. Also important is that probably the single reaction between water and TiCl4 at itself was not enough to be the cause of the accident. It was the combination of reactions between water and TiCl4 and AlCl3 that caused the problem. The reaction between AlCl3 and water is exothermic, and sped up the pressure rise.",

        "Accident Description": "At the time the fire broke out, on 4&nbsp;August&nbsp;2015 at around 17.15, the substance 2,2-dimethoxypropane (DMP) was being transferred from an intermediate bulk container (IBC) into 200-litre barrels. This manual transfer was being done using the force of gravity, with the liquid running from the IBC, which had been lifted using a forklift truck, via an attached funnel into the barrel. The transfer was taking place fairly centrally on the ground floor of the production building. On the explosion zone (ex-zone) plan, this point was marked as \u2018ex-filling\u2019.According to the work instruction, a barrel pump should be used and the IBC should be earthed. During transfer, the IBC, which had been lifted on a forklift truck, was positioned over the \u2018ex-filling\u2019 zone\u2019s collecting basin. According to statements from experts and the property insurer, for reasons that are not completely clear, the flammable vapour/air mixture was ignited by an electrostatic discharge, resulting in a fire. When trying to remove the burning IBC from the production building, the forklift driver, in order to turn, initially drove with the IBC some 6&nbsp;m backwards into the synthesis area. There the fire became so fierce that the worker was not able to continue driving. He abandoned the forklift truck with the burning IBC and fled.This created a second fire source, which was not contained by a basin. The contents of the burning IBC, which was being progressively destroyed, was therefore able to feed a constantly expanding pool fire. Because of the production building\u2019s nearby assembly opening, which created a stack effect, the fire was able to spread unhindered to the upper levels of the building. Within a very short period, therefore, the fire had spread from the mixing and separating area to the entire building.No one was injured during the fire. The production building, however, was a \u2018total loss\u2019, and its remains have since been demolished. The tank farm was not notably damaged.The total material damage amounted to approximately EUR&nbsp;22.3&nbsp;million.No material damage was found outside of the operating site. Both foam and water were used as extinguishing agents when fighting the fire. During the fire, members of the on-site fire service took measurements of harmful substances using sampling tubes. The results showed no increase in pollution.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Investigations by the property insurer found that the earth cable was not attached to the IBC and the barrel pump required by the work instruction was not used. The cause of the fire is thought to have been the ignition of the flammable vapour/air mixture by an electrostatic discharge.",

More detail should be provided on the following aspects:- the specified workflow (use of the barrel pump),- strict confinement of the transfer process to the transfer basin,- clear designation of the relevant potentially explosive zones,- use of suitable equipment in the zones,- use of suitable transport packaging (conductivity of the IBC),- ensuring that all fittings, work materials and equipment used during the transfer process are earthed. This includes the containers (barrels) to be filled and their peripheral equipment (funnels, ramps). The workers concerned should provide written confirmation that they have understood this. Structural fire protection:Following the incident, the main building can no longer be used, and it is currently being demolished. When planning the new building, the relevant regulations (above all the Industrial Buildings Directive [Industriebaurichtlinie \u2014 IndBauRL]) must be taken into account. Regardless of the resulting requirements that must be included in a structural fire protection plan, the experts recommend not only introducing fire protection means to separate the tank farm, the container storage facility and production facility from one another, but also separating the production facility into two fire compartments, as appropriate, to minimise the extent to which an initial fire can spread throughout the whole building.For the tank farm, which may still need to be used, the possibility of a secure sprinkler system must be provided, i.e. a second, independent water supply must be secured. Handling burning containers:Where a container is particularly hazardous, e.g. it is leaking or there is a (small) fire, arrangements must be made as to how it can be handled safely.In any event, it must be ensured that the burning container is not moved. Emergency drills:The operator should carry out emergency drills for \u2018typical\u2019 operational disruptions, such as leaks, overfilling or initial fires, in order to practice proper procedure. These drills should not be announced to operational staff."

        "Causes of the accident": "Experts put forward two causes: either the fire was caused by sparks from the works being done by the sub-contractors or it originated from a short-circuit in an electrical cabinet since many problems were found. In addition, the strong wind, the configuration of the building (it has a chimney) and the nature of its construction materials helped the fire to spread.",
        "Consequences": "The fire spread to the structure of the building itself as well as to five empty epoxy tanks and their associated equipment (pipework, gratings, cladding). A large plume of black smoke was released and was visible for several kilometres. At the time of the accident, several sub-contractor firms were carrying out hot work in the workshop that had been shut-down for these major works. The accident prevention plans and fire permits had been issued in advance of the works. The command post for the crisis was managed without the internal emergency plan being launched. The road alongside the site was closed to traffic while the emergency services were at work. Orders to remain indoors were issued to people living downwind and to two schools close to the site. The fire was put out around 4.30 p.m. The water used to extinguish the fire was confined to the site, which was put under containment. There was major material damage:\n&nbsp; &nbsp;it cost &euro;&nbsp;3.3 million to repair the installations;&nbsp; &nbsp;the damaged workshop could not be used for 6 months;&nbsp; &nbsp;the downstream workshops were unable to operate;\nthe operation of the upstream workshops required authorisation to temporarily increase the quantities of material stored, particularly as regards ecotoxic products.\n\nfor two hours\na road was shut\n",

        "Accident Description": "Ammonia release at an ammonia tank storage installation. Damage amounting to approx. 1,000,000 # and one member of staff killed.On 04. 01. 2005 during the morning it was foreseen to raise the ammonia level in the ammonia storage tank to a perceivable leve,l by pumping cold ammonia through a drain pipe. As preparation of this operation the injection of cold ammonia on the tank head was interrupted and a refrigerant compressor was started.In the context of this operation at 11:05 h the tank drainage valve, used as intake, was completely opened while the valve on the other end of the drain pipe was opened to \u00bc. During this operation a worker was staying on a platform at 3 m height, whereas another worker was standing below the platform. Both workers were permanently in contact over radio with the control room.Both workers heard an unusual noise after opening the valve of the drainage pipe. The worker on the platform closed the drain valve of the tank a few seconds after and left the platform over an access ladder. The control room operator noticed approximately at the same time a rapid pressure increase in the tank. In that moment (11:10) a loud bang occurred with the sudden release of ammonia gas which dispersed around against the wind. One worker could escape across to the wind. At some&nbsp; 30 m away he noticed the absence of his colleague. He immediately went towards the leak-point, finding his colleague lying on the ground injured and evidently unable to escape by himself. Nevertheless he was able to drag the victim out of the direct danger area. The victim suffered direct injuries and serious damage to the respiratory tractAnd skin burns due to ammonia.At 11:11 h another collaborator who noticed clearly the bang and ammonia release alerted the fire brigade. The fire brigade arrived at 11:23 h. At 11:37 first aid medical treatment was started.When the first ammonia release ended a leak appeared near the drain outlet at the bottom of the tank, more than 10m3/h of ammonia water were released an formed a pool in the retention pond.Ammonia evaporated from the pool and formed a visible mist which spread around at a speed of 7 m/s.During the following 4 to 6 hours two other leaks formed on the tank, located respectively approx. 90\u00b0 to the drain outlet. At approx. 15:00 the fire brigade installed basins to catch leaking ammonia water, a vacuum pumping vehicle transferred the ammonia water into a storage tank which had been prepared meanwhile. From 17:00 h on the&nbsp; release rate reduced constantly, such that it was possible from 20:00 on to start pumping the pool of ammonia water from the retention pond. At about 22:00 the leak rate in the first leak was reduced at an almost not perceivable level, ammonia was still leaking only from the later formed leak points.At about 13:00 h the day after, approx 26 hours later, there were only minimal amounts of ammonia released from the three leak points. The last rests of ammonia water from the retention pool pond and from the drain pits was continued until 06.01.2005.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The test results indicate that the accident was almost certainly caused as described by the spontaneous evaporation of ammonia. The necessary evaporation heat was generated by the reaction which was released by the mixture of ammonia water and ammonia, previously separated by an oil layer.",
        "Consequences": "Material damage inside the installation: The wall of the outer tank was ripped out of the ground, various pipes and steel structures were warped, the tank walls in the inner tank were warped.",
        "Emergency response": "Opening of the flare system valve at 6000 Pa (overpressure).Damage repaired: Measures to make tank and stairwell safe. Fuel depot can continue to be used without restriction with tanks 1-4; Environmental damage remedied: Absorption of ammonia water from pool, tank and drainage system and subsequent off-site disposal. 102 t of ammonia content recycled here. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: \n1. Withdraw technology used to cool down tank.\n2. No other immediate further action required, as warming up/cooling down process will not be necessary again in the medium term.\n"

        "Accident Description": "At 20:15 of February 1, 1994, a leak of 5 tonnes of ethyl chloride (which contained some hydrogen chloride gas and ethylene) formed a liquid pool. About 100 minutes after the release occurred, whilst firefighters tried to control the leakage, the pool of ethyl chloride was ignited resulting in a fire. It took about 11 hours to extinguish the fire and there were concerns that two reaction vessels engulfed in flames could have exploded. In the course of the fire, a total of 30 tonnes combustion products were released.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Reactor and pipework contained flammable mixture, i.e. ethylene (reactant) and ethylene chloride (product) with corrosive hydrogen chloride (reactant) and aluminium chloride (catalyst). Flexible connection (bellows) to pump at discharge failed either through sudden failure or corrosion on flange connection. Large gas cloud enveloped plant. No means of isolating leak source other than entering cloud, identify leak source and manually isolating valves. Release lasted 1.75 h before ignition.",
        "Consequences": "MATERIAL LOSS:The reaction vessel and its immediate surroundings were seriously damaged by fire and the plant production was lost for a considerable period of time (11 months out of operation). No data are available about the cost of the material losses.ECOLOGICAL HARM:Small quantities of hydrogen chloride gas were carried beyond the site boundaries but in concentrations too small to be a risk for people or for the environment. There was some pollution of the Gowy river but the ecological harm is believed to be very minor.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:A nearby road was closed and two neighbouring premises were alerted in case evacuation became necessary.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The on-site emergency plan was activated. There were never less than 8 appliances on-site. Initially, a water mist curtain was put up to limit the diffusion of hydrogen chloride gas. After the fire started, foam was applied to the two process vessels to prevent their rupture. The southern half of the site had to be shut-down (except the sodium plant and the boiler house) and was evacuated for the duration of the fire and more extensive evacuation was considered but this was not necessary.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The off-site emergency plan was activated. A nearby road was closed and two neighbouring premises were alerted in case evacuation became necessary.Emergency measures - Remarks: 2022 - flammable gas alarm sounded. 2026 - following investigation works emergency signalled. 2031 - work fire tender on scene. 2036 - major emergency declared and off-site help requested. Attempts by 2 employees to identify leak and enter gas cloud. 2047 - fire appliances arrived and set up a water curtain. 1 employee and 2 pairs of fire fighters on different occasions entered gas cloud at request of plant supervisor to close valves. 2125 - ignition. 2300 - major foam attack. - 2323 - possibility of complete evacuation of EC plant and alert to local authorities. 2350 - fire reduced to 2 main areas. 0100 - fire contained and under control. 0834 - fire extinguished. 1220 - small quantities of release finally stopped. 22 local authority fire appliances were used. The final 10 used to help transfer increased foam stocks required during major fire attack.Official action taken - legal action: Prosecution in Crown Court on 2.2.96 under section 2 and 3 Health &amp; Safety at Work Act 1974 for endangering employees and others (principally fire fighters). Company fined a total of 150000 pounds with full costs of 142655 pounds awarded to HSE. The payment of full costs is now subject to an appeal by the company.Official action taken - other official action: 3.2.94 Prohibition Notice (PN) issued prohibiting company from restarting production of ethyl chloride (EC) until it had demonstrated that \"the major accident hazards had been identified and that appropriate precautions had been taken to limit the consequences to persons and the environment\". \n4.2.94 Notice issued to leave plant undisturbed during investigation. Written notifications required to safety report because of change of working whilst EC plant closed, e.g. chlorine from electrolytic cells held in rail tankers. EC shipped in by boat and rail. \nWritten modifications to safety report required for new EC plant because of design changes. These were thoroughly assessed. Also changes to maintenance management procedures were required before the PN was considered complied with.\nThe PN was confirmed as complied with in December 1994 and the plant restarted in January 1995.Discussion about response: A published report will be available from 10 July 1996. A copy will be sent at that time if requested.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; a)&nbsp; Reassessment of risks of existing plant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)&nbsp; Review of existing design and safety provisions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)&nbsp; Consider best and most appropriate risk assessment techniques.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Adequate maintenance records to be kept to help build up history of reliability and performance on which future protocols for inspection, maintenance or replacement can be based.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequences of failure of any component of plant and equipment should be a primary factor, as well as reliability, in determining inspection, examination and maintenance protocols.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Detailed design changes to the plant by the company including(i)&nbsp; relocation of reactor - greater separation from other plant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - avoid spillage running beneath adjacent plant(ii)&nbsp; relocation and provision of large run-off lagoon.(iii) vessel connections below liquid level kept to a minimum and remotely operated shut-off valves fitted at the 3 main vessels where such connections necessary.(iv) simplification of pipework runs - 4 pumps now used.

        "Start Date": "2000-06-10 18:08:00",
        "Finish Date": "2000-10-10 23:10:00",
        "Accident Description": "A re-distillation column (reduced-pressure distillation, the operation temperature 50#) for a 50% aqueous solution of hydroxylamine exploded, and a fire occurred. The re-distillation column blew up leaving no traces, and there was blast damage to surrounding houses in a 1.5 km radius. The factory was completely destroyed. Damage outside the factory was also great. The traffic on a nearby national road was stopped temporarily by smoke and harmful gas generated by the fire. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "A highly concentrated hydroxylamine aqueous solution causes explosive decomposition by itself or by reacting with a ferrous ion. At the re-distillation column bottom, hydroxylamine was concentrated to 80-85%, and was circulated in the middle of the column. A crude 50% solution of hydroxylamine was charged into the circulating high-concentration hydroxylamine. Then the hydroxylamine solution was heated to evaporate some part of the hydroxylamine. Next, in the column, 50% hydroxylamine vapor went to the top of the column and a 80% hydroxylamine solution dropped to the bottom. As a ferrous ion contained in feedstock at about 50 ppb is reduced to 1 ppb or less in the product, part of the circulation liquid was drawn out from the bottom circulation line. Emergency blow-down piping was installed at the underside of the bottom circulation piping to draw out column fluid in an emergency, and a block valve was installed just apart from the branching point. Very short piping from the branch to the block valve was dead-end piping. The major cause is as follows: A very small amount of ferrous ions in the circulation liquid dropped to the dead-end piping, and accumulated gradually. The accumulated iron caused exothermic decomposition, and detonation was propagated from the re-distillation column bottom. ",
        "Consequences": "Human: four persons died and 58 person got injured.Factory: four buildings were destroyed by fire, nine buildings collapsed, two buildings partially collapsed. Outside factory: two buildings collapsed, five buildings partially collapsed, 286 buildings were damaged. 55 vehicles and machines were damaged. A high-voltage line was disconnected for several hours. A telephone line was damaged. The traffic on a nearby national road was stopped temporarily by smoke and harmful gas generated by the fire. ",
        "Emergency response": "Neither fire fighting nor evacuation was carried out, since only momentary explosion occurred.",
        "Lesson Learned": "As highly concentrated hydroxylamine is very hazardous, it is used or transported after being diluted. It is not designated as a dangerous material under the fire protection law if the concentration is 15% or less. When hazardous facilities are constructed, regulations that are the same as those for explosives are needed of protective barriers, a safety distance, open spaces, etc., and they should be constructed in a safe place. \n"

        "Causes of the accident": "technical failure (equipment / valves)12/03/1999 a fire occurred in a chipboard production plantThe accident investigation showed that the plant was operating under abnormal conditions: shortly before the event a switching valve for the uniform filling of a dryer had jammed, and the wood-chips fed to the dryer were unevenly distributed.The accident analysis concluded that, due to the failure of the input (feeding) valve of the dryer (realised with two parallel tube bundles), one tube bundle was fed with too much wood- chips whereas the second one was fed with not enough material.The residence time of the chips in the almost empty running part of the dryer was too long and; therefore, a part of the wood-chips overheated forming so-called \"smouldering nests\". These smouldering nests were fed to vibrating sieves and split up by the mechanical movement. The hot core was exposed.These hot cores ignited the dust/air mixture in the sieves and the consequent blast wave initiated secondary explosions and fires in the adjoining parts of the installation.The smouldering fire found in the storage of recycled material was also caused by the event.",
        "Consequences": "Material damages approximately 350.000 DM - 175.000 EURO",
        "Emergency response": "not given",
        "Lesson Learned": "1. The protection of the dryers against explosion is assured by permanently maintaining the worm feeders filled,obtained by monitoring the filling level of the bunkers. At minimal level the feeding worm is stopped, maintaining the feeding worm and the silos filled. Blasting waves from or into the dryer are certainly stopped.2. Forming of smouldering nests in the dryer was fostered by an uneven filling with wood-chips of the tandem-dryer. In future the filling of the dryer will be effectively checked by remote monitoring of the regulating system.3. Fire detectors, detecting also ignition sources &lt; 400\u00ba C, are under discussion with suppliers.Infrared detectors have,&nbsp; according to expert advice,&nbsp; a limited effectiveness in wood chip dryers.Nevertheless, employing infrared detectors will be attempted."

        "Accident Description": "\n\nOn\nwednsday Dec. 3 2008 an explosion occured in\nYaras Fertilizer Production plant in Porsgrunn Norway. \n\nThree days before, the production in the fertilizer plant had been stopped, due\nto maintenance work in the ammonia storage area which caused no supply of\nammonia to the plant. &nbsp;Feedstock to the NP - buffer tank was stopped, and\nto avoid chrystallization the buffer tank was continuosly heated with steam\n(according to normal procedures). In the stop period a lot of alarms kept\ncoming, most of them not safety related. Late evening monday december 1. a high\nalarm for temperature went off, but was signed out without any further checking\nout. Tuesday, december 2. the temperature was still on the high side, but since\nthe PH-measurements were high, and the steamvalves were shut, it was concluded\nthat the temperature measurement was wrong. Wednesday dec. 3, 10 minutes before\nthe explosion, an automatic&nbsp;fire detector&nbsp;directly connected to the\ncontrolroom of the local emergency preparedness unit and to the plant\ncontrolroom, went off. Gas was also observed by the operators in the factory,\nthe building was evacuated and the operators gathered&nbsp;at the designated\nmeeting point. Shortly after the evacuation, the\nexplosion&nbsp;occurs.&nbsp;The pressure from the explosion causes window\ndamage in the meeting-place area, and five&nbsp;operators are injured due to\nglass fragments. The explosion caused a fire in the third floor of\nthe&nbsp;building, and the fire was&nbsp; extinguished by 14.03.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "\n\nDecomposition\nof ammonium nitrate in NP buffer tank due to high temperature and low pH in the\ntank. This caused huge gas formation and rupture of the tank due to\noverpressure. The overheating was a result of a leaking steam valve on the 20\nbar steam supply to the tank.&nbsp; The indirect causes were that no hazards\nfor the NP buffer tank were defined in the Hazop study or the risk analysis and\nthat the tank was not equipped with any automatic safety functions, only\nalarms. It is also concluded that there&nbsp;was insufficient follow up of the\nplant at shut down conditions.\n\n&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": " 5\noperators with minor injuries caused by fragments of glass\n5,5 mill Euro damage to plant\nProduction loss estimated to 150 000 tons of NPK and 60 000 tons of calcium\nnitrated fertillizer\n\n&nbsp;",

The flammable materials (plastic tunnels surrounding the chemical containers) were there to prevent the spread of the evaporated chemicals into the air. The bus bar connections hadn't been tightened, cleaned or checked since the plant was built in 2001. Because of the large amount of flammable materials the fire spread really rapidly.\nThe enterprise&nbsp;had not realized that the bus bars can pose a risk when operating the plant.

When the emergency services arrived, the unit had been filled with foam up to the 10-metre-high ceiling.\nA team of three firefighters, equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), entered an adjacent room to check that the anti-fire doors were properly closed. As they advanced, physical and radio contact with one of the firefighters was lost (an experienced female fire officer [lieutenant] aged 46).",
        "Causes of the accident": "Forensic analysis showed that the foam had an unusually compact and sticky consistency (compared to cream cheese), which forced the three SCBA-equipped firefighters attending the scene to overconsume air and meant that their masks were no longer airtight and slipped on their faces. Due to the density of the foam, the victim did not have any visual contact with or means of contacting the other members of the team of three. The victim had lost contact with her direct teammate because her buddy contact rope was attached to a snap hook on her teammate\u2019s backpack, when it should have been attached to their belt. When the victim\u2019s teammates decided to turn around due to the shortage of air in their self-contained breathing equipment, they left their backpacks on the ground and the victim was left on her own, disorientated and lacking air, unaware of this decision.",
        "Consequences": "When the victim was found, she was in a coma, without her SCBA equipment and with her buddy rope unattached. In removing the victim from the scene, one firefighter sustained a minor hand injury.\nThe victim died three days later; her emergency response equipment (suit, mask, rope) was seized by the judicial authorities for investigation and the foam was also analysed. The fact that the foam remained in the building for several days disrupted the judicial forensic experts\u2019 investigations. The inspection of the unit in question, which became accessible a few days later, did not show any trace of an initial fire and the most probable hypothesis is that the fire detection system was triggered in an untimely fashion by a short-circuit.\nAn autopsy of the victim confirmed death due to suffocation.\n",

Steam was admitted to the toaster and to the jackets of hexane/miscella inlet pipes to heat-up the toasters and the extractor to the proper operating temperatures. At about 21:45 the toasters reached their operating temperature and admittance of flakes commenced through the inlet screw conveyor. After that, the following events occurred (the time shown had been approximately evaluated on instrument readings and information from the staff, as no log was in operation) until the explosion took place at 00:47:- 22:45 to 23:00: The night shift took over and at the same time the first flakes dropped from the outlet screw conveyor into the toasters.- 23:15: The toaster temperature dropped to 85\u00b0C. The plant operator therefore opened fully for the steam flow to the toaster jackets and the upper parts (direct steam) of the toasters. About the same time the safety flap valve was heard lifting releasing hexane and steam into the extractor building, where the smell of hexane was detected by the operators. This was, however, not an abnormal occurrence during the start-up.- 23:25: One of the flake outlet conveyors stopped due to overloading and the interlocking system stopped the flake inlet conveyor and the internal belt conveyor but not the other outlet conveyor nor the steam and hexane flows. High hexane concentrations were detected in the extractor building. The plant operator, however, was of the opinion that the steam and hexane flows were stopped according to the operation procedure.- 23:35: The flake outlet conveyor was restarted and the operating staff began to search for the hexane release point but without success. The hexane concentration in the extraction building finally reached a level which forced the staff out of the extractor building.- 23:55: A bus driver passing the facility detected the hexane vapours and about the same time the sprinkler system below the extractor was activated by the released hot hexane/steam mixture.- 00:15: The operating staff left the facility and from the Gate called in assistance of staff which were not on duty, including the chief plant operator (CPO). At the same time they stopped the above mentioned bus driver, when he was to pass again warning him against the possible danger. The bus driver informed the Traffic Control Center, which in turn alarmed the Police and the Fire Brigade.- 00:25: The first Fire Brigade unit arrived and decided to call in further assistance.- 00:35: The Chief Plant Operator (CPO) and the Fire Inspector on Duty arrived. The CPO went into the extractor building and located the leak to the safety flap, from which gas/liquids clearly appeared.- 00:40-00:45: The CPO and the Fire Inspector discussed how to stop the outflow of hexane vapours and decided to do this by cutting off the power supply. They called the power plant engineer and asked him to do it. Due to the inherent risk of possible sparks he rejected to stop the loaded transformers and instead, for unknown reasons, disconnected a third unloaded transformer at about 00:47.- 00:47.30: A fire seen in the far end of the extractor yard was spotted followed by a strong explosion injuring 27 persons (staff members, firemen and police officers) and damaging completely 6 buildings.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:Seed overpressure in the extractor lifted and relocated flap valve preventing reclosing. Based on the investigations carried out, it has been concluded that excessive amounts of steam leaking from the toaster to the extractor led to lifting and relocating of the safety flap valve. The steam leaking from the toaster to the extractor occurred due to lack of flakes in the outlet screw conveyors, which acted as a barrier against steam/gas flow. As a consequence, hexane was released and led to an explosion. Based on the available information it seems clear that the explosion was initiated by the disconnection of a transformer which ignited the hexane cloud.CAUSESThe leakage of hexane (flammable/explosive gas) was due to the incorrect operation of the safety flap valve caused by the failure of the interlocking system to cut-off the steam and hexane flows to the toaster when one of the extractor outlet conveyors was stopped. An unloaded transformer, disconnected by mistake just before the explosion, is believed to have caused the ignition of the hexane vapours cloud.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:27 people (staff members, firemen and police officers) were injured by the explosion of the hexane vapours cloud.MATERIAL LOSS:The plant (6 buildings) was totally destroyed by the explosion and, outside the establishment, the windows were broken up to a distance of 1.5 km. No data are available about the cost of the damages.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:Outside the establishment the windows were broken up to a distance of 1.5 km.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Evacuation of the extractor building. After the identification of leakage source, some methods for stopping the hexane leakage have been evaluated but the explosion occurred before any action could be carried out.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire brigade and the police were alarmed by a bus driver who smelt hexane vapours outside the plant and was informed by the operating staff for the possible danger. The police barred the area and the fire brigade were preparing for action when the explosion occurred. Approximately 20 people of police and fire brigade personnel were mobilised.Remarks: When the hexane concentration in the extraction building reached a dangerous level the staff was forced out of the building (code 7401). The sprinkler system below the extractor was activated by the hot hexane/steam mixture released through the flap valve (code 7102). The operating staff left the facility and from the Gate called in assistance of staff which were not on duty, including the chief plant operator (code 7107). A bus driver informed the Traffic Control Center of the possible danger, which in turn alarmed the Police and the Fire Brigade (code 7203 and 7201). Approximately 20 people of police and fire brigade personnel were mobilised. The first Fire Brigade unit arrived and decided to call in further assistance. The Police barred the area (code 7208). The Chief Plant Operator (CPO) and the Fire Inspector on Duty, after the leakage source was located (code 7999), discussed how to stop the outflow of hexane vapours and decided to cut-off the power supply (code 7999). The power plant engineer was called to do it but, due to the inherent risk of possible sparks he rejected to stop the loaded transformers and, instead, for unknown reasons, disconnected a third unloaded transformer (this was probably the ignition source for the vapour cloud). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "After this accident, it has been decided that this plant will not be rebuilt.MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:Following a visit of an expert group set up in France to establish new Safety Guidelines for extraction facilities in 1985, the following conclusions and recommendations have been considered for preventing similar accidents:1- release of gas from the safety flap must occur in a safe location;2- improvements for the design of the extractor building and its ventilation system would be necessary;3- improvements of the safety and interlock systems;4- improvements of gas detection and fire protection systems;5- improvement of the safety management.Useful references: More detailed information about the accident are contained in the document \"Ekplosionsulykken pa Dansk Sojakagefabrik\" of July 15, 1980."

        "Accident Description": "On 11&nbsp;September 2014 an exothermic chemical reaction at an organic chemical company got out of control, leading to the loss of the container contents and considerable damage to the plant. The exact circumstances and causes of the incident are still being investigated.&nbsp;\nThe details of what triggered the incident are still not known.The temperature in the reactor increased. A member of staff attempted to stop the temperature increase by exchanging the cooling water for brine. On observing rapid gas development, he partially closed the steam shut-off valve, which had been completely open, in order to prevent a pressure surge in the connected glass apparatus.On the controls immediately adjacent to the reactor, reactor pressure was at 6&nbsp;bar (and climbing) and a temperature of 123&nbsp;\u00b0C was displayed.\nSituation so far:Subsequently, a pressure surge must have occurred that was so strong that the seal between the dome cover and the base of the reaction vessel was forced out and partially destroyed. This sprayed the largely gaseous reaction mixture into the production room on the floor above, despite the safety devices having activated (the blowdown container caught around 40&nbsp;kg of the mixture).The glass safety valve in the water vapour pipe (0.3&nbsp;bar) most likely also activated, but a glass bend in the supply pipe nonetheless burst, releasing more of the product into the work area.\nA week previously, the same reaction had been carried out without incident. The heat development was familiar and the gas development was as expected (recognised by very slight foaming close to the stirrer vortex). This was the same as in the laboratory tests carried out.\nThe safety valve and the rupture disc to protect the container (6&nbsp;bar) activated, leading to around 40&nbsp;kg of product being released into the blowdown container.",
        "Causes of the accident": "From the reconstruction of the incident and the situation analysis, the reactor\u2019s thermal runaway as a result of the degradation of performic acid was identified as the probable cause of the explosion.&nbsp;\nIn addition, the investigations into the cause showed that a number of circumstances had contributed to the incident. Among other things, the following deficiencies were identified:\u2013 missing chemical kinetic data for the planned reaction;\u2013 lack of knowledge of the heating and cooling capacity of the reactors;\u2013 no systematic risk analysis or considerations regarding scaling-up;\u2013 insufficient cooling capacity owing to a partial malfunction of the cooling system;\u2013 selection of an unsuitable reactor to carry out the reaction in question;\u2013 considerable deficiencies in SMS and operational organisation.\nThe multiple changes of operator and the transition from being part of a large group with central safety operations to being a contract manufacturer no doubt contributed to the insufficient capacity of the SMS.\nUnexpected temperature and pressure development.",
        "Consequences": "Damage to glass-lined reactor and the MSR installation and surroundings, and damage to the floor covering.\nClosure of a street for around one hour.",
        "Emergency response": "Immediate evacuation of the site, activation of \u2018fire alarm\u2019, assembly at assembly point.\nInside the building:Following clearance from the fire service, the area was inspected. At that point, the lighting and stirrer in the reactor were still operating.In conjunction, preliminary cleaning of the production area was carried out in order to avoid further corrosion damage. The cleaning water was collected. Further cleaning took place after a risk assessment and corrective action.After checks on the electrical installation, equipment was turned off in order to guarantee safety. They could only be put into operation again after parts had been repaired or replaced and tested.&nbsp;\n\u2013 Initial cleaning of the affected area with water by the fire service;\u2013 The waste water was pumped by operating staff from the collection area into an emergency tank;\u2013 Cleaning and testing of equipment in the affected area;\n\u2013 Cordoning off of the site;\u2013 Setting up a decontamination bath;\u2013 Measurements in the surroundings;\nEvacuation of the site using announcements and the fire alarm, which had activated.Roll-call against presence list.\nThe fire service decontaminated the area around the boiler and significant puddles with a light jet. The rest of the clean-up was carried out internally. The flushing fluids were collected and disposed of by the company.\nRepairs to the damaged reactor and the floor, including replacing anti-corrosion treatments.Replacement of the boiler control display and other damaged electronic components.",
        "Lesson Learned": "As a result of the investigation, additional protective measures are regarded as reasonable and recommended in order to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the future.\n\nCeasing production of 1,2-Octanediol using the existing production directions.\nGeneral assessment of the safety data and a risk analysis prior to production. Compliance with data sheet R&nbsp;005 from the German Social Accident Insurance Institution for the Raw Materials and Chemical Industry (BG RCI): \u2018Transfer of chemical syntheses from the laboratory to industry\u2019, 4/2012.\nCompliance with TRAS&nbsp;410 \u2018Recognising and controlling exothermic chemical reactions\u2019, version 10/2012 for production involving exothermic reactions.\nThe cold water system and the cooling water supply are essential components with regard to safety and must be better managed, monitored and protected. This includes an updated plan of cooling capacity needs, maintaining a sufficient cooling reserve, safety alarms and switching operations, and an effective emergency cooling system for the reactor.\nOrganisational structures must ensure that departures from the setpoints generate an alert and that the cause is investigated.\nAll measurements should be displayed and recorded both locally and centrally. The data storage should enable subsequent evaluation.\n"

        "Accident Description": "In a steam-cracking unit at a Seveso-classified petrochemical site, an oil fire broke out at 15:40 in a cracked gas compressor.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Technical inspection found that an impact wrench had been left behind (probably during the five-yearly shutdown) in the third stage of the compressor affected by the accident. On the day of the accident, the wrench worked its way down to the lower stages of the compressor and ended up striking the compressor wheels, causing significant vibrations and ultimately bringing about a safety shutdown by triggering the safety system \u2018strong vibrations\u2019. At this point, a number of safety devices designed to restore the compressor to a safe condition malfunctioned: the compressor was not properly isolated due to a non-return valve that had become clogged and a motorised valve did not close properly, the electric motor being cut after the enforced safety shutdown, and the malfunction of the internal valve that should have guaranteed the oil/gas seal and pressure regulation during an enforced safety shutdown. These operating failures led to some of the cracked gas passing through the seal into the oil, which caught fire. ",
        "Consequences": "Some internal fire staff suffered from exposure to extremely high sound levels (some hearing loss) when an 80-bar steam line burst on account of the high temperature. The fire was brought under control by 17:30. There was significant damage to the compression line on which the accident occurred and surrounding infrastructure, as well as to electrical fittings and instrumentation to this line and other machines in the compressor shed. The unit was shut down for 11 weeks, then restarted at half-capacity, with only one compression stream. It is estimated that it will take approximately eight months to repair the turbine of the damaged compressor. During the complete shutdown, production losses amounted to EUR 100 000/day. ",
        "Emergency response": "The operator activated the internal emergency plan (POI) and the petrochemical-platform fire staff stepped into action. Restoring the facilities to a safe condition called for the hydrocarbons (ethylene) in the unit to be flared, with the emission of a significant volume of black smoke for a period of 24 hours. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Critical non-return valves to be inspected and repaired each time a unit is shut down for maintenance;\n\u2022 The motorised valve downstream of the compressor to be inspected and the safety threshold for the cutting of its electric motor to be increased;\n\u2022 A rapid pressure relief valve to be added to the unit flaring network under the automatic control of the compressor safety shutdown system. Protective measures have also been implemented on the steam-cracking unit: \u2022 Triple infra-red fire detectors have been added in the compressor shed and on the ground floor next to the oil-tanks;\n\u2022 Continuous video recording of the compressor shed using new cameras;\n\u2022 The sprinklers on the circular sprinkler arrays on the oil tanks have been improved;\n\u2022 Initiation of the compressor building sprinkler system has been rendered automatic in the event of a fire being detected;\n\u2022 The internal emergency plan (POI) instructions have been amended to include instructions for combatting machine fires fuelled by gas leaks;\n\u2022 Feedback from the incident has been disseminated to operators and operator training stepped up on compressor safety and on existing and new safety measures."

        "Accident Description": "18.2 tonnes of LNG were lost to atmosphere without ignitionThe water seal of these holders require an anti-freeze system to protect them during very cold weather. At this site steam is injected into the water by a fixed pipe protected by anti vacuum and non return valves, (to protect against siphoning ). Because the holders rise and fall as they are filled and emptied steam is supplied to the injectors through flexible lines. It is thought that one of these lines become trapped bypart of the holders structure ; this in turn misaligned the injector so that instead of being horizontal to and 150mm (max) below the water surface it was near the bottom and at an angle of approximately 30 C. This misalignment caused the non return valve, ( simple flap type) to fail and, for unknown reasons, the anti-vacuum valve also failed subsequently a siphon was initiated in the line downstream. The priming for the siphon is thought to be due to an accumulation of condensate provided from an earlier steam test.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Damage to a steam injector resulted in its being displaced, instead of being horizontal to and 150 mm (max) below the cup water surface it was near the bottom. The angle caused a simple flap type NRV to fall open and further upstream 'anti-vac' device, installed to prevent syphoning failed. A syphon was initiated draining water from the seal.The company relied on periodic inspection and maintenance to ensure that an anti-freeze system worked. This procedure was not properly monitored nor was the inherent weakness of the hardware recognised.",
        "Consequences": "There were no injuries to either those on or off site. As methane is a greenhouse gas there are environmental consequences.",
        "Emergency response": "The incident was managed jointly from the district office at Brentwood and Network Control at Dorking. No external services were used. There were no local evacuations and the holder remains out of service.Emergency measures - Remarks: The company are modifying steam injectors and possible entrapment points on holders to mitigate against this type of incident. Flexible steam lines are being removed for 6 months each year so the system will not be prone to damage in this period. Cup water seal monitoring devices are likely to be installed in the near future. The company will be required  to develop suitable audit and review procedures.Official action taken - other official action: Improvement notices, may be served concerning the installation of suitable cup water seal monitoring devices.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: (1) Inadequate records\nof maintenance for the steam injectors are kept (inadequate maintenance\ndocumentation).\n(2) The precautions against syphoning are rudimentary. There is no\nautomatic monitoring of the water levels in cup seals (no\nautomatisation).Measures to prevent recurrence: Modification to the steam injectors and the holder's superstructure to prevent the equipment ability to syphon and to stop steam lines fouling leading either to loss of anti-freeze capability and/or misalignment of injection equipment.Mitigate consequences: The installation of cup-scale monitoring to set an alarm if low water level are identified.

At 11:33 PM additional filling of holder commence when inlet valve opened by grid control. Only small increase in quantity of gas stored occurred. Between 11:30 PM and 3:15 AM the next day, when the volumetric governor for the site was shut off, despite the fact inlet valve open and holder should have been filling. Grid control did not notice this although instrumentation showed this to be the case. At 2:00 AM, 5.2.96, members of public reported gas escape. Emergency response team arriving at site found only 5-7 cm of water in cup and grid seal instead of the standard 45 cm's.",
        "Causes of the accident": "At present it appears release of gas was due to the failure of the cup and grip seal seems to have come about due to an insufficient depth of water on the cup. The reasons why this may have occurred are being investigated. Suspected shortcomings with remote filling and emptying procedures for holders may have played a role.",
        "Consequences": "None, the gas dispersed harmlessly.People - Remarks: There were no injuries or effects on people of any sort. The site is unmanned and relatively remote from surrounding residential areas.Ecological harm - Remarks: No ecological harm of the above types occurred because the gas was non-toxic and lighter than air and escaped upwards being ignited.",
        "Emergency response": "The site is normally unoccupied local residents smelt gas before the gas operator were sent to the site. They lowered holder into tank until the seal was remade. Holder then re-inflated to test seal which was found to be good.Emergency measures - Remarks: When grid control became aware of gas release, emergency response team sent to site and volumetric governors for site shut-off plan initiated.Discussion about response: Routine weekly dip-checks on the water seal had never indicated any problem with it. Examinations and tests carried out during attempts to reproduce conditions that could have given rise to the seal failure failed to identify any faults with the cup and grip seal and the small quantity of water found in the seal cup after the incident suggests that the incident may have occurred due to either a leakage of water from the seal cup or a failure to adequately replenish water in the cup at the time the cup and grip mechanism was dipped in the ground water tank. The fact that no obvious leakage could be detected from the cup after the i",
        "Lesson Learned": "Reasons for incident not fully identified at present. The need for\ncareful control of remote filling operations was identified as being\nnecessary to prevent the phenomenon of \"false-cupping\" occurring which\ncould easily lead to a similar release of gas.Measures to prevent recurrence: Though not full explanation of the seal failure has been discovered in the investigation, the introduction of procedures to ensure cup and grip seals are adequately replenished with water before holder filling takes place would help reduce the likelihood of such an event occurring again."

        "Accident Description": "On Friday (2 days before the accident) 32 drums, each containing 250 kg methamidophos, were placed in 2 electrical heating chamber. Methamidophos is a solid at ambient conditions. The goal was to liquefy the product which had to be mixed with other components on Monday, for the fabrication of different types of formulated pesticides. The heating rooms started automatically at 6.00 am on Sunday: the operating temperature of 80\u00b0C was programmed on Friday; also the safety temperature was set at 100\u00b0C. There was no other operation during the weekend. So there was nobody working on the site during the weekend. At 11.00 am on Sunday a foreman came to control the heating operation: the temperature was 80\u00b0C and there was no sign of a problem. At 20.30 the external emergency services received complains from residents around the establishment about a gas odour. A fire brigade came on site to control the situation with the foreman who had been called as mentioned in the emergency plan of the establishment. On 21.45 the source of the odours is detected: white fumes are escaping from the roof of the building containing the heating rooms and other installations. The firemen entered the building and located with difficulty the source because all the room was full of white fumes. The heating chambers were burning, also explosions occurred. It was the explosion of some drums in the heating chambers themselves. The plastic roof of the building, some big-bags with inert products and some small empty plastic drums were burning.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The identification of the causes is not definitive.\nOne of the suspected causes is the use of a too high heating temperature (80\u00b0C; although the laboratory had recommended a heating temperature of 40): above 45\u00b0C methamidophos begins to decompose. One of the products of decomposition is methyl mercaptan, an extremely flammable gas. This situation was known and specific measures were taken to avoid an ignition of any explosive atmosphere: sufficient ventilation, use of appropriate Ex material. The unique possible source of ignition in this case is the self ignition of the product itself. This self ignition temperature is unknown.A failure in the heating rooms (regulation or safety) can at the same time have lead to a higher temperature in the heating rooms, sufficient to ignite the flammable atmosphere or the wooden pallets. The quality of the technical methamidophos in the drums can have been different and possibly had a much lower self ignition temperature, near the normal heating temperature.Tests are done on the substance to define the self ignition\ntemperature, also functional tests of the control and safety devices of\nthe heating rooms are in progress.",

No dangerous substances were involved and the incident was not a Major Accident as defined in article 1(2)(c) of the Directive. Cable carrying the main 132 kv electricity supply to a large industrial and residential area passed immediately over the site where the fire developped and heat, flames and smoke caused repeated arching between lines carrying separate phases. The power supply became erratic for 30 minutes, was then lost completely for 15 minutes and a restricted supply only was possible during the following 2 days.As part of its article 7(2) inspection duties, the Health and Safety Executive (H.S.E.) decided to carry out an enquiry in each affected installation (submitted to article 5) to establish how they had coped with the loss of power supply. The installations included two major oil refineries. The following potential serious deficiencies were identified:1- Several manufacturers had stated in their Safety Reports that they had alternative source of mains electricity supply to their sites but they had failed to identify that both sources originated from a common supply to the area.2- Major manufacturers such as oil refineries have on-site generation capacity which can also been used to export electricity to the local supply company. They had failed to foresee that on disconnection of the external grid the internal generators would trip on overload as they tried to feed in to the external load. When the generators tripped out pre-scheduled load shedding and shut-down was triggered.3- Some automatic emergency generator start-up devices failed to operate. In one instance, the on-site generator tripped in and out rapidly and frequently as a result of the erratic nature of the public supply and the starting battery was flat by the time the supply was totally lost.4- Several manufacturers had failed to foresee that problems with so called Unintetruptable Power Supply (UPS) could result when the public supply was restored if the supplies were running out of phase.5- Several manufacturers found that they were unable to reach full deluge rates for firewater when their stand-by generators fail due to inadequate capacity of diesel driven fire water pumps.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:When the Original Report was prepared, no information were available about the causes of the wooden pallets fire. The inquiry carried out by Health and Safety Executive allowed to identify some problems (such as sources of common cause failure from power supply, unforeseen trip of on-site power generation, inability of emergency power supply systems to cope with an erratic public power supply, phasing out of Uninterruptable Power Supplies, inability to reach full deluge rates for firewater) in process analysis and plant design of the installations in case of loss of public power supply.",

",
        "Lesson Learned": "After the accident a commission from responsible authorities was taken the following actions: imposing compulsory administrative measures on the operator, incl. preparation of a complete analysis of the degree of implementation of the measures for the prevention of major accidents with dangerous substances and limiting their consequences for the life and health of people and the environment.\nIn 2015, stared the procedure for reviewing the permit. The Minister's decision is cancel the Seveso permit in 2016, which the operator appeals against. By Decision No. 10349 of 03.08.2018, the appeal of Videx AD against Decision No. 62/2016 was dismissed and entered into force on 29.11.2018. As a result of this the operator was obliged to reduce the total quantity of hazardous substances available on the site may not exceed the threshold quantities of 50 tonnes of explosive substances alone and in the composition of articles. From 2015-2018 discharge (disposal, delaboration) was suspended, no production activity was allowed and is not expected to be renewed in the future. At the end of 2018, the procedure for removal of ammunition received for utilisation from the Republic of Greece was completed - 190 570 mines were exported back. Videx AD took measures to release&nbsp; explosives and ammunition available on the site. Currently on the cite , explosive substances and articles owned by other companies are available.\nMeasures to prevent reocurrence: 1. The training of the personnel had been reviewed and improved; 2. The inspection procedures of the maintenance personnel had been reviewed and improved; 3. An annual report on the safety management system had been developed; 4. Improvements of the safety management system had been made; 5. The safety report and the risk assessment had been updated\nMeasures to mitigate consequences. After the accident the following measures had been established: 1. Simple and efficient emergency response procedures had been developed; 2. Improvements to the emergency plan had been made.\nAt the moment the safety report is not approved by the competent authority.\n&nbsp;"

Chlorine was dispersed into the atmosphere through the chimney stack (emission into the atmosphere of about 1500 kg over 18 minutes through a 30 m high stack). Finally, the relief valve was recognized as the cause of the release and it was immediately closed. The concentration of chlorine was measured at the perimeter fence. Observers were sent into the surrounding area that might have been affected by the chlorine cloud in order to ensure that, in case of danger, all windows would be closed.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nThe chlorine release occurred because:\n1- the relief valve opened when it was not necessary;\n2- the position of the relief valve (opened) was not indicated in the control room;\n3- the capacity of the chlorine destroyer plant was unknown when the accident occurred;\n4- it was not possible to regenerate the chlorine destroyer in a short time when it was exhausted.",

        "Accident Description": "During a draining operation of a cyclohexane storage tank, an operator left the valve open. A large quantity (20 tonnes) of cylohexane went to a containment designed to separate occasional leakfluids and rainwater.\u00a0Normally the cylohexane is then pumped away but due to a failed leveldetector in the containment this didn't happen and the cylclohexane could get into a containment where all waste water gets together and is then treated. Because the cyclohexane is lighter than the waste water it flew over the top of the containment instead of being pumped to the waste water treatment installation. So the cylcohexane got into the internal rain water collection system and could spread further. Eventually the problem was detected by a TOC measurement device just before the valve that gives access to the the effluent point into the habour docks. When the leak was detected everything was done to prevent an explosion and the cylohexane could be recuperated out of the sewer system and even be used again in the installations.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The operator left a valve open and the containment system didn't function properly due to failed equipment and design mistakes.",
        "Consequences": "Loss of cyclohexane.\u200bContamination of on site rainwater collection systems with cyclohexane.To prevent ignition on site traffic was stopped until the cyclohexane was removed.No off site consequences.",
        "Emergency response": "All traffic was prohibited in the affected area, the cylohexane was removed.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The operator could have been better trained for draining operations. A better risk analysis\u00a0might have detected the\u00a0unsuitable design of the containment for cylohexane drainage. Testing the level detection or having a redundant system might have avoided its failing."

There was no feedback from the Heilbronn sewage treatment plant with regard to any impact.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The automatic valve is normally open. When closing, the valve malfunctioned. As a result, the reservoir became overfull. In line with the retention plan, the suspension ran through the floor drains into the underground sewers and on into the wastewater treatment plant (20 m\u00b3).As the floor drains could not absorb all the suspension, part of the suspension flowed into the yard via the outer gate.\nThe following findings should be noted:- The floor drains were not sufficient in terms of their drainage capacity to transport the accumulated quantity of suspension to the wastewater treatment plant.- The layout of the hall floor in the entrance area was not set up to prevent the suspension from escaping into the outside world.- If the provisions of the German Ordinance on installations handling substances which constitute a hazard to water and on specialised industrial premises (VAwS) had been applied consistently and the risks and consequences of overfilling had been systematically assessed, this event could certainly have been prevented.",

This caused a fire at the North East corner of a store of 1,200 m2 containing saw dust, starch glue, seed, agrochemicals and seed treatment machinery. The fire was reported at 19:22 to the local fire brigade and was nearly extinguished by about 21:00. At about 21:15 a dust explosion occurred and the fire spread again. It was finally under control after midnight. In total, about 1,500 m3 of fire fighting water was used. It has been estimated that something less than 3 kg of methiocarb, 5.5 kg of methylthioxylenol (metabolized methiocarb), 9 kg of thiourea (a supposed metabolite of thiram), 0.1 kg of carbofuran, 0.2 kg of carbofuranphenol and 0.1 kg of other pesticides were released with the fire fighting water.

        "Finish Date": "2009-08-24 16:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Between the evening of 23 August and 16:00 on 24 August, 500 m3 of a solution containing 5 kg of uranium, 1121 kg of fluorine and 1332 kg of ammonia were emitted into the Tauran canal and then flowed into the Robine canal 3 km downstream. The substances originated from the hydrofluorination unit of a plant for the conversion of uranium ore concentrates into uranium tetrafluoride (UF4). At about 16:00 on 24 August, the daily analysis of the samples taken by the operator revealed that the thresholds laid down in the authorisation order had been greatly exceeded. 781 kg of fluorine and 962 kg of ammonia emitted on 23 August (with thresholds of 5 and 230 kg/day respectively), followed by 340 kg of fluorine and 370 kg of ammonia on 24 August. The operator immediately shut the facility down.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident had several causes. The fluorinated effluents had been stored in a tank. In order to prevent their cooling from leading to crystallisation, circulation was maintained in an external heat exchanger containing a double-walled pipe dating from 1984. The effluents flowing into the interior pipe were heated by the steam injected between the two walls. At about 21:00 on 21 August, corrosion of a pipe inside the exchanger led to the appearance of several holes with a diameter of 1 mm and to the steam coming into contact with the effluents. The mixture was discharged into the condensate collector tank, the outlet valve of which was rapidly closed by the automatic control system, which had detected an excessively high level of conductivity. The contaminated condensates filled the tank to the point of overflowing before flowing into the retention basin. At 17:00 on 23 August, the operator detected the overflow and reopened the valve after misreading the display, believing that he had seen a value of 6 \u03bcS/cm (below the maximum threshold of 30 \u03bcS/cm), whereas the screen had changed scales, and was displaying 6mS/cm. The effluents flowed into two drainage ditches and then joined the Tauran. In the following 24 hours, the personnel switched off the site's alarms and the ratemeter that had detected radiological activity in the discharge channel leading into the Tauran, without proceeding to dispel doubts regarding the possibility of an accident having taken place. Only the daily analysis of the waters of the canal made it possible to pinpoint the discharge.",
        "Consequences": "According to the health services, the waters of the Tauran and Robine are not used for sensitive purposes (abstraction of drinking water, bathing); this together with the dilution of the effluent in the natural environment rule out the likelihood of any direct health issues for human populations. Since the level of the Robine was low, the Bages lagoon was not impacted.",
        "Emergency response": "On 24 August, additional measurements performed by the operator in the Tauran confirmed the fluorine content. The operator informed the prefecture, the Classified Installations Inspectorate, the health services and the municipality on the evening of 24 August and also the press on 25 August. The Inspectorate demanded that the operator perform a complete analysis of the effluent and environmental monitoring, compile a report on the accident and take measures to avoid a recurrence of the situation; 150 samples and 500 analyses of the levels of fluorine, ammonium, nitrate and uranium were taken during 7 days from the Tauran and the Robine canals. The peak of fluorine pollution was 15 mg/l in the Tauran and 0.97 mg/l at 02:00 on 25 August in the Robine (the threshold of potability is 1.5 mg/l). A low level of fish mortality was noted on 25 and 26 August. No change in pollutant content was revealed by the piezometers installed in the proximity of the Tauran. The level of the discharge fell back below the thresholds after 4 days.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Following the accident, the operator put in place a system of preventive monitoring of ageing and has reinforced the inspection of the dimensions of pipe fittings. The display no longer changes scale and gives a specific value in case of saturation. The manual valve on the condensate tank was removed, and an automatic valve was installed for the next tanks, as was an automatic shut-off for the emissions pumps in case of non-compliance. The verification of safety and environmental parameters became systematic each time new personnel take their duty, and accidental emissions are integrated into regular safety exercises. The director of the site presented a report to the Local Committee for Information and Consultation [French acronym: CLIC] on 14 September."

A working permit was issued for the sealing, starting at 10 a.m., and the security measures for the works were considered to have been followed. The contractors, three workers from the company UMD, had started the works when they smelled H2S. When they communicated this fact to the installation foreman, he assured them that they were not in danger. Although they looked for gas masks in the installation, they did not find them and continued working. When the pipe flanges (Dn 150) were removed, the workers were immediately exposed to highly concentrated H2S and poisoned. The foreman, trying to save the workers, was exposed to H2S at a higher concentration and for a longer time, resulting in his death. The refinery\u2019s own medical service intervened promptly to save the victims, who were then treated by the Constan\u021ba County Emergency Services. After a three-day hospitalisation, the three workers made a full recovery.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Even though they detected the presence of H2S during the sealing operation, both the foreman and the workers minimised the risk of poisoning and continued working. The operation was not included in the works programme, which is why there was no preparation. .",

Once the stock in the buffer tank was exhausted, an operative activated the transfer pump and opened the check valve of the corresponding tank. A hydraulic shock occurred as a result of the vacuum caused by the pump starting before the valve had been opened. A bend downstream of the valve detached from its PVC piping. The tank partially supplied the production line, but emptied partially into the bund via the detached bend until the accident was discovered by the patrol 2 hours later.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Four months previously, the operator had abolished the night team specifically responsible for transferring products between the storage tanks and the packing lines.\nOnce the stock had been exhausted in the buffer tank, one of the operatives had to go to the building housing the storage depot control station at around 22:00. From the control desk, he started the transfer pump then opened the check valve on the corresponding tank. A hydraulic shock occurred as a result of the vacuum caused by the pump starting before the valve had been opened. A bend downstream of the valve detached from its PVC piping. The tank partially supplied the production line, but emptied partially into the bund via the detached bend until the accident was discovered by the patrol 2 hours later. The bund sensor malfunctioned and did not trigger a visual alarm at the site guard house. The investigation has revealed that there were no operating instructions or instructions for transfer operations, despite the production team not being trained in the use of the transfer control station (a task previously carried out by a specialised team). Once the transfer was launched, no one remained in the building housing the control station to monitor the smooth operation of the transfer remotely. The control station display did not show the position of the valve at the base of the tank, which could have alerted the operative to the risk of water hammer in the transfer pipes. The working of the transfer pump was not linked to the correct opening of the tank check valves nor to the detection of low levels in tanks. Once the leak was detected, staff did not activate the balloon plug for the site\u2019s sewerage systems, contrary to the instructions in place.",
        "Consequences": "The bund was not watertight and 30 l of product accumulated in a trough upstream of the rainwater system. The product remaining in the bund was pumped into an empty container while the leak from the bund was blocked. A small mobile pump was used to pump the product in the network into an empty container urgently retrieved from the refuse. The container had contained acid and this led to the release of chlorine, which caused the mild poisoning of one employee.

The intention was to fill the sample container with approx. 30 t of PS beads (polystyrene) to prepare the next batch. During the cooling of the batch, the filling was started. The automatic start of the process showed weather-related functional uncertainties (frost), so that after switching to manual mode the units were started in the same way as the automatic function in the following order: - Start blower - Open slide after rotary valve - Start rotary valve - Open slide between rotary valve and silo. The filling path was preset automatically. There were malfunctions of the slide between the rotary valve and the silo. After multiple activations, the slider opened. It began the filling process. After about 40 kg of delivery (about 1 min), an explosion took place. After the explosion, the staff working on the roof noticed violent movements of the roof. Then the roof was left.

Staff were alerted by a dull sound and a drop in pressure; 400 m3 of naphtha flowed from the crack in the pipeline into a retention basin of 5 000 m3 situated several hundred metres downstream. 200 m3 of the content of this basin leaked from 2 sluices that had remained open and were not closed until 27 minutes later. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "A pipeline ruptured as a result of widespread cavernous corrosion (corrosion caused by differential aeration) on a strip of 50 mm, with loss of thickness (1 mm on average but up to 3.5 mm in some spots).",
        "Consequences": "A security perimeter of 1 000 m was established, traffic was interrupted on 2 routes and 282 residents from 2 municipalities were evacuated.\nTwo firemen who felt unwell were given oxygen. As impacts on the fauna and flora of remarkable protected areas were discovered (mammal, amphibian and invertebrate mortality), an evaluation was carried out (fauna, flora, water, sediments, soil/subsoil, ecotoxicity and genotoxicity), in addition to which surface water and groundwater were monitored more intensively.\n",
        "Emergency response": "The internal operation plan was launched around 19.30. The staff was evacuated and the guard, who felt unwell, was hospitalised.\nAs there was the risk that the flammable cloud that had formed along the flow route of the naphtha would ignite, the prefecture set up a crisis unit and launched the offsite emergency response plan at 22.00; 75 firemen, one mobile chemical intervention unit, a pollution control unit and about twenty gendarmes were mobilised. The rescue services spread a foam layer on the surface of the liquid in the retention basin and installed water curtains to destroy the cloud.\nFour booms were placed in the Ausselet and Largue rivers, which were strongly impacted by the leak over a length of 5 km. At 04.00 most residents were able to return to their homes, but water collection was suspended in 3 municipalities.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "The operator laid down a first set of measures to remedy the shortcomings discovered: motorisation of the sluices, with remote control from a control room, their connection to pressure reduction detectors, modification of the equipment used to isolate pipeline sections in case of leaks, addition of more oil-content meters and checks on the condition and leak-tightness of the sluices."

At about 8:00am a process operator commenced an azeotropic distillation (according to the work instructions) of toluene contaminated with water contained in a drowning vessel. However, three days earlier the main condenser had been removed for maintenance without previously checking the contents of the vessel and cutting off the utilities (steam, electricity supplies). The vapour line had not been isolated. The operator applied steam to the jacket of the vessel and, after about 15 minutes, it reached a temperature of 80-85\u00b0C. A significant amount of toluene vapours was seen to vent from the 10.2 cm vapour line into the building where a number of processes were performed and various hazardous materials were stored. Flammable vapours did not find a source of ignition. The operators turned off the heating and applied cooling. The site alarm was sounded and the process building was temporarily evacuated.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nThe distillation of the toluene/water mixture took place with the main condenser removed from the plant for maintenance. The drowning vessel was containing 2,500 litres toluene/water. The toluene vapours were vented into process building through the vapour line.\n\nCAUSES:\nThe condenser was removed from the plant without precautionary measures being taken to ensure it was safe. The permit to work system was in operation but was not followed properly by the operator, probably due to the insufficient training. Besides, the procedures for maintenance and work permit were insufficient.\n",
        "Consequences": "Since the toluene vapours were vented, through a 10.2 cm vapour line, into a process building no toluene release occurred in the environment and no effects occurred outside the establishment.People - Remarks: 20 people working in the process building when the accident occurred.

        "Accident Description": "On 27&nbsp;February 2013, there was a leak in a tube-bundle heat exchanger in an acid tank storage facility, which led to the release of approximately 120&nbsp;kg of oleum.\nThe heat exchanger is used to control the temperature of the oleum by means of a recirculation process and thus prevent solidification during storage. The process is only necessary in the winter months; an exchanger that has been installed for 10&nbsp;years therefore has an operating life of only about five years.\nProcess/sequence of events\nSteam enters the shell through a side nozzle just behind the tube sheet. An impact plate is fitted to prevent the steam from hitting the bundle directly.\nThe damage consisted in a tube wall being punctured on the outlet side of the oleum. The formation of sulphuric acid when the leaking oleum came into contact with the heating steam then caused local corrosion of the non-alloy steel shell, allowing the oleum to escape into the environment.\nThe plant fire service created water curtains to combat the sulphuric acid aerosol mist. No persons or property or the environment were affected, either on or off site.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Steam erosion as a result of an impact plate that was too small is considered to be the main cause of the damage to the tubes.\nSecondary damage to the heat exchanger tubes was caused by the formation of sulphuric acid, leading to erosion of approximately 2&nbsp;mm of the thickness of the tube walls in the space of 36&nbsp;hours.",
        "Consequences": "The plant fire brigade put water curtains to combat the sulfuric acid aerosol mist. There was no impact on people outside or inside the factory premises, things and environment.",
        "Emergency response": "- Plant fire service alerted;- Supply pump switched off;- Line valves closed;- Sulphuric acid aerosols controlled using water cannons.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The expert recommends using a larger impact plate and regularly measuring the thickness of the tube walls (initially after a year of steam operation).\nThe findings are important for the construction and design of heat exchangers containing hazardous substances."

        "Finish Date": "1999-07-21 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Loss from storage of 16.561 tonnes of 30% solution of sodium cyanide to bund. Reportable as the incident involved the accidental loss of more than 5% of the qualifying amount laid down in the COMAH regulations.At approximately 15.30 hours on Wednesday 21 July 1999, a maintenance supervisor noticed wetness around the berm of tank 713. It was concluded that sodium cyanide was leaking from tank 713. At 16.50, following checks for suitability and cleanliness, the transfer of the tank contents to tank 402 commenced. A pump was also set up to collect product pooling in the bunded area. The atmosphere surrounding the tank was checked for cyanide vapour. None was detectable at any height above 5cm from the wet bunded area floor.Meteorolgical conditions at the time of the incident were not significant, except in so much as the leak was detected initially by a visual sighting by an operator of the leak against an otherwise dry tank berm. It may be conjectured that it would have been significantly more difficult to observe this leak had the berm already been wet from precipitation.",
        "Causes of the accident": "&nbsp;It seems likely that the cause of the leak was a weld slag inclusion from the original fabrication of the tank in 1977. The weld slag inclusion is at the stop start of the run of the weld. It is believed that water penetrated between the inclusion and the parent weld during water jetting operations. This then produced rust and in turn pressure capable of dislodging the inclusion and forming the leak path.\n",
        "Consequences": "Loss of 16.561 tonnes of sodium cyanide solution (30% w/w aqueous ie, 3,690 tonnes of sodium cyanide) to tank bund.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "Effluent discharge to river suspended. The Environment Agency instigated a matrix sampling operation of the river. Several bore holes were sunk in a pattern around tank 713 and attempts made to recover the spill. No adverse effects on river life were noted. A pump was set up to recover material pooling within the bunded area to a waiting road tanker. This recovered 4.260 tonnes of solution, reducing the quantity lost to the river to 12.301 tonnes.Official action taken - other official action: A COMAH prohibition notice was issued by the competent authority, prohibiting use of the tank until repair was made to the satisfaction of the competent authority.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: A COMAH prohibition notice was issued by the competent authority, prohibiting use of the tank until repair was made to the satisfaction of the competent authority. The leak was believed to be due to an original fabrication fault and furthermore the standard of bund required at the time is not appropriate to the prevention of material loss from the site."

        "Start Date": "2012-11-14 15:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "2013-03-14 22:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Fire broke out in a 60 m\u00b3-silo half-full of polyurethane dust, in a Seveso-classified plastic insulation panel factory. At approximately 14:00, there was an explosion in a polyurethane panel crusher; its expansion within the silo increased the pressure and one of the outlet vents gave way, causing a second explosion noise. Subsequently a fire broke out, releasing smoke and gas, including carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The alarm was set off at 14:05; 80 staff members were evacuated and the internal emergency plan (POI) was deployed. The internal safety teams made use of a factory fire hose and called the external emergency services at 14:15, who arrived between 14:30 and 14:45. The power supplies to the site were cut off and rainwater-network blocking valves were activated.\nThe police force and gas, electricity and rail service representatives, as well as the deputy mayor and sub-prefect arrived on site. At 15:30, safety representatives evacuated the industrial and commercial zone (26 persons) and restricted movement for 500 local residents. A safety perimeter was established around the site. Fire service officials, equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), cooled the silo with fire hoses. Foam was injected from above. The undertaking does not have any technical drawings of the silo at its disposal. The maximum hydrogen cyanide concentration recorded was 4 ppm, compared with the exposure limit value of 1.9 ppm. The extinguishing water overflowed the retention structure but still remained contained on site, retained by the waterproof external courtyard. At 19:00, power lines were reconnected and one production line resumed operation. The fire was fully extinguished at 22:00. At 01:00 a second production line resumed operation. During the emergency, one firefighter was affected by carbon monoxide. With resources from other departments, a network to measure the level of hydrogen cyanide in the affected area could be set up.\nThe following day, at approximately 10:00, once the hatch had been opened, SCBA-equipped firefighters emptied the silo from the bottom. This work was then taken over by a private company. The inspectorate responsible for classified facilities attended the scene. The safety services completed their work by 20:00.\nThere was only limited damage to the site: The cladding panels of a workshop were blackened by smoke and the crusher was slightly damaged; the silo can be repaired. All production lines, which were shutdown for a few hours and which remained intact, resumed operation on 15 November.\nThe silo in question is used to store two forms of polyurethane dust waste: fine machining dust aspirated off and passed via a bag filter before being transferred to the silo and coarser sawdust particles aspirated off as waste from a polyurethane-panel crusher located directly adjacent to the silo (linked by 20 m of tubing to enable aspiration from the crusher to silo). The dust particles are ultra light, weighing 450 kg per 30 m\u00b3. Given the site layout, it is unlikely that the machining section caused the fault (given the intermediary transfer via the filter, the duration of the aspiration process, absence of metal components, etc.). It is probable that the crusher was responsible, considering the fire marks on that device and the fact that crushed panels contain a fine layer of aluminium that could have generated a spark. Moreover, the crushing of panels releases pentane, which can be explosive or flammable under certain conditions, such as, for example, when a crusher heats up. These panels are often the source of fires breaking out in storage containers during crushing. The operator examines these hypotheses in the accident report.\nThe operator is looking into installing a spark detection system in conjunction with a valve diversion or water sprinkler system. Further measures are envisaged: increasing air dilution in the crusher area, installing pentane detectors, and installing a belt or screw conveyor for the open-air evacuation of crushed panels. The crusher will not resume operation until the completion of corrective and preventative measures, the implementation of which will be monitored at the next meeting of the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CHSCT).",
        "Causes of the accident": "The waste panel crusher is responsible for the fire in the dust silo.\nPotential causes: the breaking of a metal component, creating sparks causing fumes to explode, or an electrical fault or electrostatic energy created by the crushing of panels coated in aluminium.\n",
        "Consequences": "Release of smoke and toxic gas.\n80 staff members were evacuated and a safety perimeter was established. 26 persons were evacuated from the commercial zone and movement was restricted for 500 local residents for a three-hour period.\n600 m\u00b3 of water used to extinguish the fire was collected in the factory\u2019s recovery tank. The concentrations measured in the extinguishing water did not exceed any of the standard levels, so it was disposed of in the natural environment. Damage to the site was limited: the cladding panels of one workshop were smoke-damaged and the crusher was slightly damaged; the silo can be repaired.\n",
        "Emergency response": "The internal safety teams made use of a factory fire hose and, at 14:15, called the external emergency services, who arrived between 14:30 and 14:45. The power supplies to the site were cut off and the rainwater-network blocking valves were activated.

The fire service, equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus, cooled the silo with fire hoses and then injected foam from above.\nThe following day, at approximately 10:00, once the hatch had been opened, the SCBA-equipped firefighters emptied the silo from the bottom.",
        "Lesson Learned": "To avoid the recurrent problem of such fires breaking out, the operator is looking into installing a spark-detection system in conjunction with a valve diversion or water sprinkler system.. Further measures are envisaged: increasing air dilution in the crusher area, installing pentane detectors, and installing a belt or screw conveyor for the open-air evacuation of crushed panels. "

        "Start Date": "2015-12-18 03:50:00",
        "Finish Date": "2015-12-18 06:37:00",
        "Accident Description": "Pressure increased in an intermediate bulk container (IBC) and hydrogen chloride gas was released.\nThe building was evacuated and the gas was suppressed using water curtains.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The mixture of 3-chloro-o-xylene and phosphoryl chloride in the IBCs came from the site\u2019s vacuum unit, where 3-chloro-o-xylene is used as ring water. Over time, this becomes enriched with phosphoryl chloride and is replaced at regular intervals. The only explanation for the intense gas build-up observed is hydrolysis of the phosphoryl chloride with water or alcohols.\nAn inspection of the substances handled at the facility found that, irrespective of the product/formula, there was no sign of any other critical interactions/reactions. This also applied to the case of cross-contamination between formulae. An inspection for potential water contamination in the ring water found the following possibilities:\n\nLeakage into the heat exchanger, which is operated using cooling water;\nReverse flow of moisture from the waste gas collection system;\nInsufficient emptying of residues from the IBCs.\n\nRe 1: Apart from the cooling liquid in the heat exchanger, no water or alcohol is handled at the facility. An inspection of the heat exchanger found increased roughness on the upper surface, but no leaks were detected during pressure testing.\nIt must also be assumed that, in the event of a small leak in the heat exchanger, the small current of escaping water would react in the liquid-ring pump. The resulting HCl gases would be removed via the exhaust system, and would therefore not lead to an increase in pressure.\nRe 2: The waste gas collection system is decoupled from the facility by a non-return valve. An inspection of the valve found no defects. Also, the limited amount of moisture expected in this event is considered to be insufficient to produce the amount of gas observed. It must also be assumed that in such an event, the moisture would react in the liquid-ring pump. The resulting HCl gases would be removed via the exhaust system, and would therefore not lead to an increase in pressure.\nRe 3: Once the IBCs have been emptied of residues, they are visually inspected for any remaining liquid before being made available. Despite this visual inspection, however, liquid residue may still be present. Even small amounts of water (e.g. 10&nbsp;l) cause a considerable build-up and release of HCl gas (e.g. 10&nbsp;m3), which can compromise the integrity of the IBCs.\nBefore the incident, the ring water had most recently been purged and collected in three IBCs on 5&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015. As the hydrolysis delivery pump was malfunctioning on 5&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015, the phosphoryl chloride in the ring water could not be promptly hydrolysed or destroyed, and the IBCs had to be stored temporarily. On that day, one of the three IBCs was emitting HCl, for which the on-site fire service was called and the HCl that had escaped was immediately successfully suppressed with water curtains. For this reason, the IBCs were stored in the chlorine tank wagon shed. From there, on 17&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015 the IBCs were returned to the chlorination building to be prepared for destruction. By 17&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015, no critical situation had occurred in the other two IBCs, which is perhaps due to the fact that, up to that point, the IBCs had experienced only the slow formation of a two-phase system, resulting in a slow reaction only at the phase threshold, or that only a small quantity of water was present in these IBCs. As the IBCs were closed during transportation to the chlorine tank wagon shed, and were otherwise stored there with only a lid placed on top, the HCl gases that were most likely already being released were able to escape via the lid due to the slow speed of the reaction. Therefore, no critical build-up of pressure was observed.\nOnly when the IBCs were closed or insufficiently opened when transported back for hydrolysis in the chlorination building was it possible that the HCl gases being created could no longer escape, which must have led to the build-up in pressure in the IBCs in the chlorination building. Furthermore, transportation may have led to an increase in the phase threshold, resulting in an increased rate of gas release. This caused the loss of integrity of the IBCs associated with the release of HCl gas, as observed on 18&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015. Up until the day of the incident, the aforementioned mixture was handled openly and sent for correct disposal. The procedure has since been changed.",
        "Consequences": "Outside the operating area, one person was injured and to be treated on an outpatient basis.",
        "Emergency response": "Population alerted by sirens and loudspeaker announcements, escaped gases suppressed using water curtains.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Change in procedure:According to the new procedure, the mixture of 3-chloro-o-xylene and phosphoryl chloride arising from the process is no longer handled openly and sent for correct disposal, but instead is distilled within the enclosed facility. The recovered phosphoryl chloride is then fed back into the process, and the 3-chloro-o-xylene is sent for correct disposal."

        "Causes of the accident": "The incident was triggered by a chain of various faulty facility components:\n\nThe gas capacity sensor was incorrectly calibrated for the status \u2018gas holder full\u2019. While the capacity displayed was at 83&nbsp;%, the actual capacity was already at 100&nbsp;%. The safety chain, which would have switched off the compressor at 90&nbsp;% capacity and activated the automatic gas flare at 95&nbsp;% capacity, could not therefore be triggered.\nThe mechanical overpressure / negative pressure protection system did not discharge the specified 400&nbsp;Nm3/hr, despite high pressure.\nThe additional electrical gas overpressure and negative pressure sensors were not connected on the gas side, nor were they wired up correctly, and also failed to trigger the safety chain. Before it entered into operation, the facility was partially accepted by an expert within the meaning of Section&nbsp;29a of the Federal Emission Protection Act (BImSchG). The inspection report required the operator to rectify certain deficiencies prior to commencing operation and to confirm this in writing to the expert. In particular, the measuring devices had to be calibrated and verified. Once this work had been carried out, the expert had no concerns as regards safe operation.\n\nCalibrating the gas capacity sensors required completely raising the membrane of the container. As this could not be achieved while the expert was present, the correct adjustment had to be confirmed by a specialist firm. Once calibration was complete, it could be assumed that the capacity indication was correct.The functioning of the mechanical overpressure / negative pressure protection system was also tested, confirmed and documented by the expert. The electrical gas overpressure and negative pressure sensors were successfully tested to ensure they functioned properly, and this was documented.At some point after the expert\u2019s acceptance testing, the electrical sensors\u2019 connections were altered such that they no longer functioned. The calibration of the gas capacity sensors required by the expert was not arranged for by the operator. Furthermore, the exhaust pipe on the overpressure / negative pressure protection system was fitted with a rain cover, the suitability of which is not documented (this was not there at the time of acceptance testing). It cannot be conclusively established whether or not this cover resulted in a safety-relevant impairment to the exhaust pipe, which meant that the required pressure release capability was no longer available. Safety devices incorrectly installed, sensors incorrectly calibrated and low performance of overpressure / negative pressure protection system.",
        "Consequences": "Foil roof and biogas membrane torn/destroyed.",
        "Emergency response": "Gas-side separation (isolation) of the digestate storage tank.\nRepair, once the cause had been established and approval had been granted by the expert.",
        "Lesson Learned": "- Both membranes of the air-supported roof replaced;- Gas overpressure / negative pressure sensors connected properly, and safety chain set correctly;- Second overpressure / negative pressure protection system installed, with a capacity of 600&nbsp;Nm3/hr of biogas;- Renewed safety inspection of the digestate storage tank. The lessons learned from this accident are as follows:- Acceptance testing by an expert represents a snapshot of the prevailing condition of the facility at the time of testing. If changes are made to the facility, in particular to safety-related equipment, conditions for safe operation can no longer be assumed in principle.- The investigation revealed that the facility was put into operation without the deficiencies, in particular the capacity monitoring, having been rectified as required by the expert. The competent authority was only belatedly made aware of this situation. The inspection report was not promptly forwarded to the authority. It is therefore advisable to establish enforceable written standards for acceptance testing by an expert in accordance with Section&nbsp;29a, as well as for follow-up inspections, deadlines and forwarding inspection results to the authorities. These standards should support and facilitate monitoring.- Biogas facility operators often rely on assistance from contractors, as they themselves do not have the requisite skills. A strong emphasis must be placed on the credentials of outside companies. It is important to document the work done and to hand over the documentation once work is complete, so that each operator is aware of potential errors and the necessary follow-up measures, including inspections."

        "Accident Description": "Leak of 3.4 t of gaseous vinyl chloride over a period of 5 hours.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The incident occurred when the safety valve of the degassing circuit opened due to a lack of air. This option is based on a historical risk analysis and without experience of the valve opening accidentally. Congestion formed as a result of the humidity in the distribution system of the valve and a temperature of -3\u00b0C, thereby limiting the passage of air.&nbsp; The operator had not realised that the valve could cause releases of VCM into the air, except as part of its safety functions.\nThe release continued for 5 hours, because the valve responsible for it was not identified immediately. This valve is not equipped with a discrepancy alarm (difference between order and actual status). Furthermore, its exhaust is not fitted with the means to measure outgoing VCM. The operating team assumed that leaks from the valves of two autoclaves were the cause of the release of VCM. They interpreted the low readings on the gas meter as being caused by failure of the compressor by-pass valves. The operating team misinterpreted the incident because of incomplete instructions and a lack of information on the screens in the control room and on the schematic diagrams available on the process monitoring software.\nFurthermore, the site\u2019s standby staff was not immediately informed of the ongoing incident. The risk analysis for the site does not identify a scenario in which VCM is released on the degassing line.",
        "Consequences": "It is estimated that 3.4&nbsp;t of gaseous VCM leaked over a period of 5&nbsp;hours. The east-to-west direction of the wind directed the VCM plume towards the inside of the site.",
        "Emergency response": "Between 02:45 and 09:00, at a plastics factory classified as an upper-tier Seveso establishment, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) was released from a VCM degassing and condensation circuit. At 02:25, a valve in the degassing circuit opened. Between 02:45 and 04:45, the low-level alarm of the gas meter was activated and the compressors shut down. At the same time, the VCM readings on the chromatography detectors in a workshop where the degassing reactors are located showed concentrations of between 5 and 10 ppm. The operators noted that the valves of 2 autoclaves were leaking. They tightened the valves and made a request for maintenance. Around 08:00, a spike of 12&nbsp;ppm of VCM was detected in the roof area of a laboratory near the condensation unit. The control room was confined. At 08:50, the day shift noticed billows above the degassing section. At 09:00, the teams on duty manually closed the valve in question, which had been left open. The release of VCM was stopped.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The operator will make all the operating teams aware of this incident and of the action plan prepared on the basis of the cause-consequence analysis made after the incident. In particular, it intends to:\n\ncheck \u2018sensitive\u2019 equipment capable of causing VCM to be released into the atmosphere, carry out a HAZOP analysis of the systems in which they are integrated, set in place specific monitoring of this equipment and systematically launch an incident report if there is a malfunction involving this equipment. Additional actions may be identified on completion of the HAZOP analysis, such as checking that the equipment is used in accordance with suppliers\u2019 recommendations;\nmake the operating teams aware of the need to carry out incident reporting and use the lessons learned from this incident to make recommendations for the future;\nadd alarms on valves that may lead to a release of VCM;\nreview and create different \u2018alarm data sheets\u2019 to cover situations that, until now, have rarely or never occurred on the site.\nstandardise the process monitoring software in order to identify potential failures more easily;\nadd information on the schematic diagrams and on the screens in the control room;\nupdate the procedure for alerting the site\u2019s standby staff.\n"

During the work to recover processing liquid (free conveyancing work) there was an explosion at the probe followed by a fire.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Cause status: the accident was probably caused by an unsuitable substance (H2O2) used during routine probe treatment work to increase the productivity of the probe.\n\nThe cause has not yet been definitively determined, not least because the procedure to ascertain the damage in the underground probe area and specialist investigations have not yet been concluded.\n",
        "Consequences": "Material damage inside the installation: explosion and fire damage to premises and technical equipment in the probe area, and in particular to the storage probe. Damage outside the plant; \n- some windows were damaged in the explosion.\n\nThree people inside and six people outside the installation were injured\n\n",
        "Emergency response": "Safety function: the underground gas storage probes and thus also the storage probe concerned are fitted with a range of safety devices which can be used to regulate and shut off the gas flow inside the probe. It was possible to stop the uncontrolled gas leak by closing the so-called Shear Preventer.Emergency measures: safety measures: a large number of fire teams were deployed after the explosion and cooled the probe with water. Specialist firms were also called in to secure the probe. The police sealed off roads outside the premises as a precautionary measure.The efforts of the onsite and offsite emergency response services were well coordinated.Damage repaired: specialist firms have been put in charge of repairing damage inside the plant area. The minor damage caused outside the plant (broken glass) has been repaired. Safety measures by offsite emergency response services: fire fighting;Evacuation measures by offsite&nbsp; emergency response services: 43 people were evacuated from neighbouring allotment gardens from 10.46 am - 11.53 am as a precautionary measure.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:Following the emergency response measures implemented directly after the accident, operations to re-establish the functionality of the probe head were started on the basis of a specific work program. It was noticed that the probe's inner channel is blocked from a depth of approx. 4.20 m and it is therefore not possible to examine the underground part of the probe using the equipment currently available. For this reason, the operator of the underground gas storage installation is developing a new work program which includes a risk assessment for the measures to be implemented. The program is designed to ensure that the probe can drive over its full extent, to supervise the dismantling of the probe and to restore the probe to a safe condition for mining.Restriction measures:&nbsp; In future, only staff directly involved in the work will be on the site inside the plant for the duration of the operation."

        "Accident Description": "During works on a liquid gas container (Subterranean Stored Pressure Vessel, 5600 kg content) a gas-explosion occurred, in which 3 persons were seriously injured. The full volume of the vessel was usually reduced from 5600 to 3000 kg. As required by the short distance of the tanks from the service building. For this it was installed a new gas extraction valve with integrated overfilling safety system. The modification works were carried on by two mechanics of a skilled company. An employee of the company helped in the modification works. The container was mostly discharged and should only be emptied of the residue and then cleaned. For this, neither safety devices were used nor the residue gas was flamed. Instead of this the injection and extraction pipes were disflanged, so that the out flowing gas escaped until the gas overpressure exhausted. In order to withdrawn the residue gas still in the tank, this was filled with water, which was pumped in the tank by an electrical dipping-pump from the near available flow.\nThe motor integrated in the immersion pump was supplied by a current elongation cable which was inserted in a socket of the service structure. \nDuring throwing in of the immersion pump and with this filling of the vessel with water the back pressure was so strong, that the mechanics (workers) could no more support the tube and the employees of the company solicited the plug of the elongation cable to draw out, in order to shut down the immersion pump. During withdrawal of the plug a sudden explosive fireball occurred, an explosive flame struck high and the gas from the tank burnt. The three present persons suffered large burns, their clothing had in part taken fire. The material damage through the burnt tanks amount at 20,000 DM. No environment damage occurred.",

        "Causes of the accident": "Human error (operating error)A release of liquid chlorine occurred due to an incorrect operation of a liquid chlorine valve on a tank wagon.The liquid chlorine spill was discovered, and the wagon emergency stop valve was immediately manually re-closed.The installation's personnel were unable to start-up the safety procedures (opening of the vapour exhauster, water sprinkling) which have to be started manually, because of the chlorine being released and the need to leave the unsafe area. The doors of the filling station building were still open, because the tightness control, which according to the standard procedure must be carried out with chlorine gas originating from the storage tank, had not yet been performed.Cause: Because of the incorrect operation, the liquid chlorine valve was erroneously activated too early. The resulting pressure surge in the filling pipeline (the connecting valve between the filling pipeline and the storage tank was still shut), caused the failure of the gasket on the slip-on connecting flange between the tank wagon and the filling pipeline, which led to the liquid chlorine spill.",

        "Finish Date": "2001-09-21 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "At 10.17 am, a severe explosion (detonation) occurred in shed 221. The detonation, felt several kilometres away, corresponded to a magnitude of 3.4 on the Richter scale. Significant dust fallout from the installations and a crater were observed outside the plant. A large cloud of dust from the detonation and red smoke drifted to the north-west. The appearance of the smoke is linked to the emergency shutdown of the nitric acid manufacturing installation. Before rapidly dissipating, the cloud containing ammonia and nitrogen oxides sickened witnesses who complained of eye and throat irritations. The atmospheric pollutants released after the detonation lead to the formation of nitric acid (HNO3), ammonia (NH3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from ammonium nitrate. As a precautionary measure, the local governmental authority (\u201cPr\u00e9fecture\u201d) requested that the population of Toulouse confine themselves to their homes. This measure, the efficiency of which was limited owing to the damage to numerous homes, nevertheless reduced the number of traffic problems after the accident. From a strictly technical point of view, and according to the measures and observations made by the experts, it should be noted that the detonation gave rise to an overpressure in the order of 140 mbar (threshold retained to characterise the lethal effects in the danger studies) at a distance between 280 and 350 m and 50 mbar (threshold retained to characterise the irreversible effects on human health in the danger studies) at a distance between 680 and 860 m. This observation can be constructively compared to the fact that there were victims resulting from indirect effects up to 500 m away on the one hand, and injuries caused by broken glass at distances of a few kilometres away, on the other hand.",
        "Causes of the accident": "On the eve of the explosion, 15 to 20 tons of ammonium nitrates with an additive in qualification phase was brought into shed 221. On the morning of the explosion, products derived from the packaging of the ammonium nitrates and the manufacturing shops were also transferred into the shed. The last addition of material by bin coming from another storage zone was made less than 30 min before the explosion Several inquiries and expert evaluations were conducted: - judicial inquiry, - administrative inquiry conducted by the French Ministry of the Environment with the participation of industrial hazard experts [3], -ATOFINA (mother group) internal inquiry, - inquiry by the CHSCT (the plant committee for hygiene, safety and working conditions). Many hypotheses were formulated to explain the explosion: Unintentional external causes associated with accidental technological or natural phenomena (methane due to underground bacterial activity, lightning, meteorite, falling aircraft parts, explosion of a bomb or nitrocellulose underground following previous site activity); all of these hypotheses proved to be unfounded. Intentional external causes (attack, malicious mischief, missile) conjured up and spread by public opinion in the same context as the \"Twin Towers\" terrorist attack in New York, on September 11, 2001. From a legal standpoint, this hypothesis is not supported by any tangible facts. A process incident (an internal electrical fault at the plant, electric arc, missile effect from a part projected at high speed\u2026). An examination of manufacturing parameters at the time of accident would not however explain this type of incident. Concerning the possible high speed projection of a piece of metal causing a primary explosion in a filter at the top of a tower near the site of the explosion, experts feel that the kinetic energy developed by the projection of debris from the filter would be insufficient to cause the nitrate contained in shed 221 to explode.As far as an accidental chemical reaction is concerned, the nitrates used were polluted by iron oxides, sulphur and in contact with bitumen used to pave the floor of shed 221 or following the mixture of incompatible chemical substances, such as ammonium nitrate with sodium dichlorocyanurate (NaDCC, a product used in treating swimming pools); the incompatibility of these substances was highlighted during court-ordered laboratory tests. Favoured differently by the entities concerned, none of these hypotheses have lead to a consensus. In may 2006, the final report presented by the expert investigators to the plaintiffs supports the theory of a chemical accident, attributing the causes of the disaster to an unfortunate combination of a few dozen kilos of sodium dichlorocyanurate with 500 kg of ammonium nitrate spilled on the main nitrate pile 20 minutes before the detonation. It is worth noticing that, since the very beginning of the industrial manufacturing of nitrogenous fertilisers early in the 20th century, ammonium nitrate have been involved in several major industrial accidents while being stored or dispatched . On July 26, 1921 in Kriewald (formerly German Silesia), the \"dislodging\" of wagons filled with ammonium nitrate using explosives caused a detonation killing 19. Less than 2 months later, on September 21st, in Germany's Oppau plant, blasting work on a pile of aggregated fertiliser mix containing ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate produced a detonation responsible for 561 deaths, 1,952 injured and the near total destruction of the town. Twenty years after that, in Belgium, explosives were still being used to disaggregate a pile of ammonium nitrate, resulting in another several hundred deaths at Tessenderlo. Despite the production of coated nitrate to subsequently avoid nitrate aggregation, several detonations of ammonium nitrate still occurred either in France or abroad, thus confirming the complex characteristics (e.g. chemical composition, particle distribution, density, humidity) associated with these categories of products and their detonation potential under circumstances promoting their instability: mixing, hazardous outcome when reacting with other materials or pollutants, temperature, containment\u2026",
        "Consequences": "< HUMAN At the time of the explosion, 266 plant employees and 100 agents from sub-contracting companies were present at the site. The accident resulted in many casualties: 21 at the AZF site, 1 at SNPE and 9 people outside the site (2 of which were in hospital) who were killed by the explosion or deceased in the days that followed, more than 30 people were seriously injured of which 21 remained hospitalised for more than one month (300 more than 6 days). A student at the Gallieni professional college, located 500 m from the epicentre, was killed and several other injured when a concrete structure collapsed. Two people also died in a vehicle maintenance establishment located 380 m away and one person died in the EDF (Electricity company) building located 450 m from the epicentre. Thousands of people were hospitalised; the local authority (Pr\u00e9fecture de Haute-Garonne) counted a total of 2,442 people as of October 17, 2001; 8042 peoples are submitted to a legal medical investigation. The INVS (health national institute) and the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es DRASS (local health authority) published a progress report in July 2002 and a final report in September 2006 on the sanitary consequences of the explosion [2].\nThe information gathered during this epidemiological study allowed the short term impact of the catastrophe to be assessed by clearly identifying the sanitary effects of the environmental exposures and by describing the physical and psychological traumas. Numerous physical traumas are registered: wounds, fractures, amputations, contusions\u2026 Auditory troubles resulting from the double effect of the blast and to the acoustic trauma due to the explosion were extensive: partial or total deafness, pierced eardrums, hypoacousia, tinnitus, otalgia\u2026 Among the nearly 6,000 students located in a radius of 2 km around the site who underwent testing 8 to 10 weeks after the explosion, 5.5% of the secondary school children and 6.3% of the primary school/kindergarten children suffer from hearing deficiencies (> 25 dB). Health professionals were recommended to conduct hearing deficiency examinations on the individuals who were within a radius of 1.7 km at the time of the explosion. The NO2, the NH3 and the particles released by the explosion were responsible for transitory ocular (conjunctivitis, vision disabilities\u2026) and respiratory irritations (tracheobronchitis\u2026) in the population living near the site. These problems appeared to decrease within 5 weeks after the accident. However, the collected data allow to establish the absence of significant health effects potentially associated with these substances in the short and long term. According to the heath services and considering toxicological and epidemiological knowledge on the exposure-hazard relationship, it appears that there are no disquieting consequences concerning the health risk associated with the release of asbestos (cancers, fibrosis). However, labour protection regulations must be carefully applied for individuals working on site cleanup operations. The water monitoring system allows any alteration in raw water quality and the water distributed in the hours following the catastrophe to be detected. The occasional overshoot of quality limit values for NH4+, NO3- and NO2- do not represent a health risk for consumers. The risks associated with soil contamination (soil thrown from the crater), both direct and indirect (food) have been disregarded. Psychological traumas are also registered: more than 8,000 people consulted their general practitioner for acute post-traumatic stress in the weeks following the explosion. Five thousand people began a psychotropic treatment (anxiolytic, antidepressant, hypnotic). According to the experts, these numbers are underestimated as they only take into account the individuals who sought medical care. The explosion had a major impact on psychological problems (depression, anxiety\u2026). In addition, two studies conducted jointly with the French National Educational Service show that one year after the accident, one out of seven students still displays clear signs of post-traumatic stress. Continued monitoring of the medium and long-term health effects will be conducted via various elements of the epidemiological system: a cross-section study (a descriptive epidemiological study at time t) concerning approximately 50,000 salaried employees of the greater Toulouse community and 5,000 rescue personnel, on the one hand, and monitoring of a cohort of 5,000 salaried employees derived from this study (biological examinations), on the other hand. Finally, long-term analysis is planned to identify the causes of death (changes in the mortality rate) of the employees who agreed to give their addresses during the initial study. The information systems of the heath care structures which supplied the data are independent from one another and the existing databases cannot be interconnected when they exist. A person may be recorded in several of these systems without it being possible to detect the error and may be counted more than once. Also, the results do not allow precise quantitative estimates to be made regarding the overall number of different troubles observed. In addition to the physical and psychological traumas suffered by the population of Toulouse, there are significant social disturbances notably linked to the destruction and damage to homes, community equipment, buildings, technical unemployment, and to the loss of work\u2026 Associations and a collective have been organised to combat industrial hazards and to defend the interests of the populations concerned. ECONOMIC extensive property damage and production losses for the plant operator, neighbouring plants, retails and individuals, cost of clean-up and rehabilitation measures of the area (total cost estimated above 2 billions euros).Nearly 1,300 companies, representing approximately 20,000 employees, claimed losse. The shock wave and various projectiles damaged 82 schools, 19 middle schools and 15 high schools (36,000 students), as well as 4 establishments of higher education and 3 university dormitories. In front of the factory, a depot containing roughly one hundred busses was destroyed (30,5 M\u20ac) and numerous other store were damaged. A household appliance store located 320 m from the explosion's epicentre, as well as a vehicle maintenance facility at 380 m, collapsed also claiming victims. A total of 25,550 homes were damaged to various degrees, 11,180 of which were seriously damaged. More than one thousand homes were completely destroyed and more than 1,200 had to be relocated immediately. ",
        "Emergency response": "Immediate firefighting and rescue measures: The local authorities and several governmental departments activated emergency centres, the municipality set up a support centre for the population and the operator installed a crisis centre within the establishment. The PPI (special administrative accident response plan) and the plant\u2019s emergency plan were put into action; reinforcements were requested to assist the departmental firemen, the civil protection mobilised a chemical hazard evaluation cell and technological catastrophe specialists. During the first 6 days,1,430 people were thus mobilised, including 460 firemen from the region, 620 firemen from other districts and 350 military personnel of the UIISC (civil security units). Roughly fifty doctors, 32 nurses or health care practitioners and more than 80 ambulance drivers were also mobilised. The monitoring of access routes, looting protection and guarding required 500 to 600 policemen and 13 companies of special CRS (riot control) policemen rotating between September 21 to October 3, 2001. Crisis management operations also mobilised 350 police officers plus 80 belonging to a mobile squad; primarily for traffic control, reinforcement and sanitary convoys. Considering the extent of the collateral damage and the inherent risks, numerous buildings and schools were evacuated. A security perimeter was set up in a radius of 500 m around the site. Thoroughfares around the site were closed. Traffic on the freeway, the southern ring road, the A62 and A64 motorways, the RN 20 highway, the metro, the railway station and Blagnac airport were interrupted. The numerous injured are admitted to local hospitals. The population was ordered to remain confined as a precautionary measure and masks were distributed around the site. In late morning, the Prefecture announced that the toxic risk was under control and that all danger of atmospheric pollution had been dismissed. The precautionary confinement order was lifted around 4.00 pm, and rail and air traffic was reestablished. Nevertheless, the population was asked not to consume the tap water. The pollution of the Garonne was also brought under control.The PPI was lifted September 28, 1.00 pm.\nSecuring of the site: At the request of the classified facilities inspectorate and according to an emergency procedure, on September 21, 2001 the Pr\u00e9fet issued an order suspending the activity of 6 companies operating within the chemical zone (AZF, SNPE, TOLOCHIMIE, ISOCHEM, AIR LIQUIDE and RAISIO) requiring them to secure their sites. One company, SOFERTI in Fenouillet, which recycles off-spec products coming from the storage facility that exploded, was also the subject of an emergency prefectoral order requesting it to secure its chemical substances; inerting operations were set up for this purpose. The crisis centre of the inspectorate remained active for 3 weeks after the accident in order to ensure that the various sites were secure.The securing of AZF site included several delicate operations: recovery and removal of stocks of ammonium nitrate in hot solution, industrial nitrates buried near the crater, liquefied ammonia, nitric acid\u2026 Expert evaluation and validation of the procedures were requested prior to certain operations. During the drainage of a liquefied ammonia storage tank, an uncontrolled release of approximately 9 tons of ammoniated solution resulted in pollution of the Garonne and fish mortality. It took several months to secure the AZF site and the other plants concerned, which namely involved the evacuation of dangerous substances. At the request of the Pr\u00e9fet, the corresponding operations were carried out by the operators under the control of the inspectorate. In this manner, according to the latter\u2019s estimates and for the AZF plant alone, 4,000 tons of agricultural nitrates (fertilizer) and 800 tons of industrial nitrates buried under the gravel and rubble of buildings destroyed by the explosion, were to be cleared out and removed in the 4 months following the explosion. SNPE, ISOCHEM and TOLOCHIMIE were required to conduct an audit of the property damage and conduct analysis of the safety conditions. Based on a proposal by the inspectorate, the Pr\u00e9fet also required that a third-party expert evaluation be conducted, as defined in article 3-6 of the order dated 09/21/77. In addition to this,150 agricultural or industrial ammonium nitrate storage installations are monitored throughout France\nRemedial :The remediation of the site led by the operator aimed essentially at reducing the concentrations of hydrocarbons, lead, arsenic and mercury in soil. In July 2006, after two years of work, more than 750,000 cubic meters of earth had been excavated, nearly 90% of the contaminated earth and concrete had been depolluted through on-site washing and heat treatment at 850 \u00b0 C. Depollution work is completed in early 2008. The operator estimates the cost of clean up measures at 100 million Euros .In autumn 2006, the construction of a cancerology center is announced on the site of the former AZF plant. The center will ultimately house 4,000 people, mostly researchers, on a campus of 220 ha. The Pierre Potier research Institute is inaugurated in late 2009, joined in 2010 by pharmaceutical companies. Finally, the University Hospital of Cancer, whose construction began in late 2009, opened in 2013.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "An inquiry by the Parliamentary Commission was opened October 24, 2001 relative to the safety of industrial installations and research centres, and relative to the protection of persons and the environment in the case of a major industrial accident. As of January 29, 2002, this commission had formulated 90 proposals along six major themes: reducing the risk at the source, the human factor notably with the employees playing a role in the prevention of accidents, the implementation of greater openness and pluralistic expertise with regard to disasters, urban planning questions, the adaptation of judicial procedures and the compensation of the victims of industrial catastrophes.\nWithin a few months, the French public authorities undertook different reflective thinking and actions: In the field of prevention, in order to: -Broaden the field of application of the SEVESO 2 directive by lowering the ammonium nitrate threshold, - Limit the risk presented by ammonium nitrate-based fertilizers by adapting their technical specifications to make them intrinsically less explosive, - Improve the prevention of major accident risks in ports and railroad yards, - Ensure the continuity of the security between fixed installations and the transport of dangerous substances, - Reinforce the exchanges between member States relative to the hazards associated with ammonium nitrates (fertilizer and industrial nitrates), - Reinforce the exchanges between member States relative to the cohabitation of activities at risk with other economic activities, residential housing and thoroughfares, - Harmonise the risk evaluation methods between France and the member States, - Access to improved harmonisation of methods and inspection means of establishments at risk by the public authorities, - Reinforce cooperation between research and expert assessment organisations in the European Union, - Re-examine the safety conditions of high-level SEVESO facilities,\nO In the field of inspection, in order to:- Reinforce significantly the staff of the inspectorate - Reinforce the inspectorate through technical support for the examination of danger studies, - Check the fertilizer storage and ammonium nitrate storage facilities governed by the environmental legislation. O In the field of openness and information to: - Create more than 200 experimental local information and joint action committees (circular of July 12, 2002), - Publish (via Internet) the new operating authorisation orders accompanied with the inspection reports. The scenario of detonation had not been selected in the risk analysis of the plant either by the operator, the inspectorate or by third experts, because the existing feedback led to consider as unlikely the detonation of ammonium nitrate when compliant with manufacturing standarThis disaster clearly shows that the contingency plans must consider a series of scenarios of the type, severity and kinetics representative of possible accidents even if their probability is considered extremely low. The method for evaluating the risk proved to be insufficient. The danger study must consider the danger potential of installations, examine possible scenarios and their consequences including the most dramatic or improbable, estimate probabilities and characterize the modes of occurrence. Reducing risks at the source must aim at reducing the potential for danger, the probability of accidents occurring and limiting the consequences through appropriate organisational and technical systems. The legal system did not enable sufficient control in terms of urban planning, particularly for the existing industrial sites whose surrounding area had already been urbanised."

        "Consequences": "The water side of the interceptor overflowed and crude oil then entered the drainage system where it filled the tank farm roadside drains. Some crude oil entered a small storm water lagoon; however no oil entered the nearby creek that discharges into Corio Bay. The estimated quantity of oil spilt was in the vicinity of 50-100 tonnes.",
        "Emergency response": "...",
        "Lesson Learned": "While the installation of independent high-level alarms will significantly reduce the likelihood of a similar incident occurring, routine checks andinspections also remain important.Further measuresA detailed investigation was conducted into this incident. It was unable to determine whether the pump did not start because of a float switchfailure or because the pump was on manual. A number of actions were agreed and are currently being addressed. Remote high priority sump level alarms are to be provided to the panel room. The adequacy and suitability of existing automated crude dewatering facilities are under review. Alternative options are being investigated for the handling of ships\u2019 tank washings and ballast water to reduce the amount of water draining necessary from the tank farm. The requirement to carry out routine patrols as required was reinforced with all shifts. Where workload prevents scheduled tasks being carried out, the shift team leader and shift controller are to be advised to enable alternative coverage to be achieved."

        "Finish Date": "1990-12-11 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "ENVIRONMENT AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Gentle wind (2 metres/sec) from South East under \"F\" stability class.At 12:18 hr an isobutane leak with hydrogen fluoride traces occurred in the HF alkylation unit. It occurred when one of the two small bore pipe tappings into a large 10\" (250mm) pipeline underwent fatigue fracture owing to vibrations. This tapping was used to allow process stream into a flow transmitter. The initial leak rate (at the operating pressure of about 16 barg) was about 11.8 tonnes/h. Shortly after the first failure, the second tapping nipple fractured and the total release rate became 23.6 tonnes/h. The gas did not immediately ignite and the leak was quickly identified both by plant instrumentation and visually. The activation of remotely operated valves allowed the&nbsp; isolation of the process piping and the diversion of the contents of the isolated section to a flare within 2 minutes. The escaped gas cloud ignited probably on a diesel engined painters mobile hoist after a few minutes, resulting in a small flash fire. The isolation and venting was so successful that the accident was over in 25 minutes with the fire extinguished.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:Owing to vibrations, a 1/2\" (12mm) scheduled 160 nipple in flange orifice screwed tapping fatigue fractured. The fitting was new (only 11 hours in service). The isobutane leak occurred at approximately 16 barg. The escaped gas cloud, probably ignited on a diesel engined painters mobile hoist that was operating nearby, resulted in a small flash fire.CAUSES:The accident was caused by the fatigue fracture (due to vibrations and, probably, to an inadequate component design) of a 1/2\" scheduled 160 nipple in flange orifice screwed tapping.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:3 people were injured by the accident: one from the shock, one from inhalation of isobutane and the third with burns caused by the flash fire. All were taken to hospital in a precautionary way but only the operator with burns was detained overnight.MATERIAL LOSS:Pipework lagging, electric cables scaffold boards were damaged during the accident but no data are available about the cost of the material losses.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Full site emergency alert. The internal emergency teams put into operation the water monitor sprays during vapour dispersion and after the ignition. Cooling was applied to the nearby plant vessels in order to prevent B.L.E.V.E. The activation of remotely operated valves allowed the isolation of the process piping and the diversion of the contents of the isolated section to a flare.&nbsp;EXTERNAL SERVICES:The external county emergency services were called but the accident was over and fire extinguished before they could deploy their equipment.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\nAfter the accident, the following measures were established:1- replacement of the flow metering device with a non-intrusive one;2- review of the use of mobile diesel-powdered plants in the area of process units with the purpose of reducing its use;3- extensive vibrations monitoring to identify any equipment causing excessive vibrations;4- full survey of pipework supports on plant."

        "Accident Description": "At around 3:45 p.m. on 1 December 2016, a fire broke out in the facility at the refinery where residues from the vacuum plant are converted into light products, a confined area of small size compared to the refinery as a whole. The Internal Emergency Plan (IEP) was triggered immediately and, in line with it, the authorities were notified of what had occurred. The steel structures in the vacuum residue conversion facility were caught up in the fire. The firefighting equipment and vehicles at the refinery were used to fight the fire and bring it under control.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident is presumed to have been caused by a mechanical failure of the system for regulating a secondary supply line providing the reactor with hydrogen. The rupture caused a hydrogen leak and thus a jet fire (at an elevation of about 8 m from ground level) that affected other components and equipment.The assessments carried out showed that the rupture occurred close to a valve in the hydrogen pipe with clamp connectors, in the vicinity of the reactors. The causes of the rupture were identified as being the result of anomalous operation of the facility due to reduced/non-existent hydrogen flow that led to cooling by natural convection and consequent thermal stress. The loss of flow in the pipe occurred because of a compressor becoming blocked and a second compressor reducing to minimal flow.The fire then caused some other components in the facility to rupture, leading to a partial release of hydrocarbons. This was also the result of the malfunctioning of a cut-off valve when operated manually, probably because of a power cut owing to the power supply panel being affected by the fire.There was also a fire near the air coolers that broke out when the facility was depressurised rapidly because of stresses in excess of those designed for.",
        "Consequences": "The facility suffered such major damage that it had to be rebuilt. There is no record of the event having consequences for human health, the environment or non-company property. The data recorded by the air quality monitoring network did not reveal significant increases in the concentration of the pollutants measured.",
        "Emergency response": "At 3:40 p.m. a worker on the spot noticed a leak in the structure behind the reactor and reported it to the control room. The operational staff who went to the location found white smoke leaking from the hydrogen supply line followed by the outbreak of a fire with a light-coloured, horizontal flame. The alarm was raised and the order given for the unit to be rapidly depressurised and cut off. The firefighting team attended an air cooler where a fire was clearly breaking out and in the vicinity of the reactor using the necessary firefighting vehicles and equipment to contain the incipient fire and cool the surrounding metal structures. The fire brigade was called at 4:05 p.m. once it had become clear how serious the situation was. When the firefighters arrived, they continued the containment and cooling activities with the help of refinery personnel. Operations continued through the night until 7:50 a.m. on 2 December, with cooling and control activities going on until the afternoon of 2 December. As per the IEP, the local authorities were kept constantly abreast of how the accident was developing, both by the company and by fire brigade representatives present on site. Based on how the situation developed, the local authorities did not deem it necessary to trigger the External Emergency Plan (EEP).",
        "Lesson Learned": "After the accident, the operator provided the relevant technical authorities with the plan for rebuilding the facilities affected by the events, indicating the improvements that had been identified following an analysis of the operational experience and the additional preventive and protective measures aimed at avoiding any repeat. Following the analysis of the causes of the accident, the measures proposed concern both redesigning parts of the facilities and implementing additional management measures to monitor critical equipment."

A man was found lifeless outside near the factory buildings 15th March 2012. The exact time of the event is unkonwn, but the worker was found at 9:20. Accident had no eye witnesses, but it is assumed that the worker had died because of breathing hydrogen sulfide. Elevated concentrations of hydrogen sulfide were detected in the area after the accident in the yard at the plant. Casualty had not use a gas gauge or a gas mask.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident investigation revealed deficiencies in the company's process safety management.The technical cause of the accident was the reaction caused by limestone slurry which was automatically pumped to the storage tank resulting in a discharge of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide into the air.A valve was left open and limestone slurry was leaking to the floor. Slurry ended to the floor drain from where it was pumped to the storage tank. Alkaline slurry and acidic solution in the tank reacted and carbon dioxide was released. Carbon dioxide filled the gas space of the tank and carbon dioxide with hydrogen sulfide were released into the air. Weather was calm and the concentration of hydrogen sulfide remained high. The worker without gas mask died.\u00a0",
        "Consequences": "One worker died. The accident had no effects on the environment or property.",
        "Emergency response": "The company had an internal emergency plan. Rescue operations were practised systematically, but the focus of the exercises was not on hydrogen sulfide accidents. The main responsibility for emergency response is on the company's fire department, because the distance to regional rescue service is long. Contractor's workers saw the casualty lying on the ground at 9.20 am. They moved the casualty further away and started to give first aid. Company's fire department got the emergency call at 9.30 am and they arrived at the scene of the accident at 9.35 am. Company's fire department continued first aid but finally found casualty dead.

        "Finish Date": "1997-12-02 15:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "An explosion followed by small fires occurred inside a hall (hangar, industrial building) of the establishment, in which mixing and dilution operations were carried out. The explosion occurred while two workers were concluding (finishing) the loading (filling, charging) with nitrocellulose scales of a mixer (dissolver) of 4 m3 containing ethyl acetate. The nitrocellulose was stored in barrels (kegs) and was poured in the hopper of a worm feeder equipped with a shielded (explosion protected) motor. Small fires developed following the ignition of flammable materials (rags, ink tanks, resins, pigments) present in the hall (hangar). The few barrels (kegs) near the mixer which had still to be charged  did not catch fire. The two operators (workers) were injured, but not as seriously as a worker a few metres from the hall (hangar) who was carrying out transport operations of barrels (kegs) with a lift truck (3rd degree burns), he has been hit by the flash. Another worker who was working in a laboratory adjacent to the hall (hangar) when the explosion occurred was seriously injured by a separating wall which fell down due to the pressure wave.\nThe causes of the accident have not yet been identified, the starting point has also not been determined. Nevertheless it is plausible to assume that the explosion occurred externally of the mixer, due to the fact that the lid of the mixer stayed in its place (original position). The explosion should have had the characteristics of a deflagration. The loading (filling, charging) with nitrocellulose is performed by inserting feed-line (supply line) through a hatch located on the mixer lid. Eye witnesses have stated that they have seen a flash (fire) develop more or less at the same time of (concurrently to) the blast (explosion). The flash (fire) has fully hit the worker on the lift truck, severely burning him. The equipment (appliances) inside the hall (building) do not show evident damages.The explosion occurred when the loading (charging) operation with nitrocellulose&nbsp; was almost terminated (finished).The access to the hall is blocked due to the demolition (collapse) of the structure. As a consequence it has been impossible at the moment to find any element for identifying the causes and the ignition source.The two operators have declared to have followed the standard procedures. Regular training courses are held for the personnel.The witnesses present have moreover declared to have smelled the presence of ethyl acetate vapours, which are recognisable through the intense smell.More or less at the same time as the explosion a violent flash (fire) developed which has hit plainly one operator which was driving a lift truck a few metres outside the hall (hangar).",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident may have originated from the ignition of vapours probably released from the hatch and accumulated (concentrated) in the corner of the hall due to insufficient internal ventilation. The release may have also occurred through the flanging of the lid. The mixers are ignition shielded with a nitrogen atmosphere with a light over-pressure. Small probes (detectors) inside the mixer connected to an alarm monitor (detect ) the Oxygen (O2) concentration. The alarm is calibrated at 3% oxygen content and another at 0.5 bar (atmospheres). There has been no alarm before the explosion, nor, according to the persons present at that time, has there been any persistent smell due to the presence of ethyl acetate.\nThe ignition source is unknown.\nBoth workers charged with the filling operation affirm to have followed standard procedures. One of the workers had been engaged since a few months.",
        "Consequences": "The explosion, with characteristics of a deflagration, has\ncaused: the partial collapse (break-down) of the perimeter wall of the\nestablishment, which was located at 1.5 m (1.5 metres from the mixer\nand which had a thickness of 25 cm (25 centimetres, 0.25 metres); the\ncollapse (break down) of three dividing walls in the hall (hangar) of\nthree bays (spans) of hall (hangar) No. 13; the destruction of a hoist\n(elevator) bay having a size of 1.8 x 1.5m, located at the opposite\nside of the hall (hangar); rupture (breaking) of all glass windows\n(glazing) of the hall (hangar). The mixer in question did not show\nserious damages, due to the fact that the explosion occurred most\nprobably above the mixer. The motor of the feeder was thrown\n(projected) at a distance of 2.5 m (metres) from the mixer, whereas the\nscrew (worm) of the feeder although being damaged, stayed in its place,\nand turned over laterally (on a side) due to the pressure wave. Many\nwindows broke in the buildings of the establishment up to 200 m from\nthe explosion point. There have been no effects off-site (outside of)\nthe establishment.People - Remarks: 13 persons were injured of\nwhich 5 not seriously which were dismissed from hospital the next day,\n6 of the other 8 received a prognosis between 30 and 60 days, the other\ntwo a reserved prognosis. One of the seriously injured received 3rd\n(third) degree burns on 70% of the body whereas the other one suffered\nfrom a head injury, multiple fractures and a liver injury.\nThere were 20 persons present in the hall when the accident occurred.\nIt has not been considered necessary to include in the population at\nrisk the other workers present in the establishment (approx. 250\nothers), although they may have been exposed to the risk of injury from\nthe projection of fragments (glass in particular).\nThere has been no damage to the personnel of the emergency relief teams\nnor to persons outside the establishment.Ecological harm - Remarks: The fire extinguishing water was collected in the used water recovery tanks of the establishmentMaterial loss - Remarks: Damage to equipment has still to be evaluated. Relevant damages to the structures of hall No. 13 and to a lot of windows (glazing) of the buildings in the establishment. The economic damages have therefore still to be quantified.Disruption of community life: There has been no interruption of services outside the establishment. The accident has had a resonance at national level due to its gravity (seriously injured workers) as well as due to the singularity of its dynamic.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "The emergency response action started a few seconds after the&nbsp; explosion. A team of fire fighters composed by 25 elements (men) was immediately activated, and, with the help of a special vehicle equipped with a manually controllable and monitored nozzle and portable fire extinguishers with solid materials (dry powder), has extinguished&nbsp; in a few minutes the small fires which had developed consequent to the explosion. Also the automatic water sprinkler system was immediately activated, with the exception of the installation on the collapsed wall which was destroyed.When the first fire truck of the fire brigade of Cinisello Balsamo reached (after about 15 minutes) the site of the accident all fires had been already extinguished. Afterwards the fire brigade teams from Milan, Monza, Saronno reached the site. The first ones to arrive were 60 policemen. After about an hour a police team with dogs intervened to check the eventual presence of bodies under the collapsed wall (debris).The evacuation plan of the establishment was immediately activated, 267 workers were present at that time.The first ambulance arrived after approx. 25 minutes from the accident and has rescued and transported to the hospital of Cinisello the most seriously injured. Approx. 10 min after the arrival of the first ambulance other 4 ones equipped for burns arrived from Cinisello, Monza, Milan and Saronno.The injured persons had been brought outside the hall (hangar) by the on-site emergency response team before the ambulances arrived, while first aid care was left to the specialised personnel.There was no interruption of services outside of the establishment.Official action taken - legal action: A judicial investigation is under way in order to determine eventual responsibilities regarding the accident.Seveso II duties  - remarks: The establishment is\nsubject to the general provisions in the field of the control of major\naccident hazards, as foreseen by the Italian legislation implementing\nthe \"Seveso I Directive\" EC/82/501 (Art. 3 D.P.R. 175/88).\nBut it is not required to present to the national authorities any\nnotification or declaration completed by a safety report.",

        "Lesson Learned": "This tank had been repaired in 1989 following an incident that caused delamination without failure of its fastenings, due to a CO2 release during sulphuric acid neutralisation; an angle bar had been added and the cleaning procedure had been modified.\nAvailable feedback pointed to several H2 explosions after a steel reservoir attack with diluted acid at other plants.\nGiven the succession of accidents arising over the previous few months in the chemical and petroleum industries, combined with the pipeline transport of hazardous substances, a meeting was organised in September 2009 to discuss industrial safety challenges and environmental protection between the Secretary of State for Ecology and industry leaders in these sectors. The industry delegation submitted proposals for improving the safety of their facilities, led by enhanced ageing controls on installations and their maintenance, while committing to greater focus on sensitive ecological zones in order to improve species protection and preservation zones."

        "Accident Description": "SAFETY SYSTEMS OR OPERATORS INTERVENTION:The supply of steam was interrupted.OTHER SYSTEMS INVOLVED AND OPERATING CONDITIONS:Formation of an explosive air-phosphine mixture in the work area and in the drain system. When the failure began the mixing tank contained about 150 kg of solution of ca. 50% of hypophosphorous acid. The 50% acid was produced by concentration of 3000 liters of 2.5% acid at temperature conditions of about 50 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius in vacuum (ca. 40 mb). From analysis in the laboratory the concentration 45 minutes before the event was about 37%. Shortly before the event the above mentioned parameters were controlled and found unchanged. Probably at the liquid level in the mixing tank a crystalline incrustation formed. This then dryed because of over- heating and decomposed spontaneously. Apart from phosphoric acid an amount of phosphine was formed as decomposition product sufficient to destroy the vacuum and to drive back the unfastened manhole cover. Phosphine was released to the work area and ignited when mixing with air. At the same time part of the substance flowed via the vacuum pump into the piping system that wasstill intact at the moment of the first explosion. There an ignition took place causing the second explosion.",

        "Causes of the accident": "The development of the accident is not yet completely clear.The leak occurred through the little losing well containing the ejector of the fire fighting system joined to the ACH tanks. The fire fighting system for the ACH tanks is based on a foaming substance which is conveyed by water of the fire fighting network in the ACH tank at a level close to the bottom. The ejector system is sited in a little well with losing bottom. In case of fire inside the ATC tank the mixture of foam and water is introduced in the tank. The water pressure broke two Teflon membranes having the function to separate the ATC from the water of firefighting system. It is to supposed that \nphenomena of aging together with a non perfect clamping of ejector's parts have caused the leak (material degradation, fatigue). Such leak spread successively from the ejector well (which was losing) to the ground.",
        "Consequences": "There were no effects on human health. It was involved the superficial water-bearing stratum. The Local Sanitary Unit and the PMP (Prevention Multizonal Garrison) are going on with daily tests over 25 wells. It is involved the superficial water-bearing stratum (5-8 m) but not the first water-bearing stratum (30 m) due to the presence of an impermeable clay stratum. The water-bearing stratum from which the drinking water is withdrawn is at 60 m then is still more protected. However the pollution of the superficial water-bearing is very high and it is necessary to continue in the future to verify that the deeper strata are not involved. This problem is emphasized in the ordinance of the Mayor of the city.",
        "Emergency response": "The mayor issued ordinances in date 94 09 16, 94 09 23, 94 10 13 and 94 12 05. Such ordinances oblige the ATOCHEM Company to:- carry on studies on the morphology and permeability of the clay stratum and on the flow behaviour of the superficial water-bearing stratum;- realize a mechanical barrage and a hydraulic barrage, with purifying system of the withdrawn water;- install some piezometer for the control of the first and the second water-bearing stratum;- study solutions to permit the oxidation on site. Moreover the mayor authorized the ATOCHEM to transfer the polluted water withdrawn from underground by the pumps of the hydraulic barrage (toxic waste) for their provisional storing nearby the \"Italiana Petroli\" company. The mayor authorized also the provisional storing nearby the ATOCHEM through the installation of a containment basin. He has obliged also the ATOCHEM to daily measure, by the piezometers, the concentration of acetone, free cyanides, total cyanides and ACH. Finally the mayor asked the ATOCHEM to give an exact evaluation of the released ACH. ATOCHEM has prepared a reclaim plan based on the prosecution of the ACH squeezingoperation from the water-bearing stratum and on the continuous water emission in the pouring point and in the well No.2, with squeezing in the downstream wells 9, 10 and 12, up to values near to 0. Analysis of the ground and following treatment of the same are foreseen. On February 28 1995 the mayor authorized the Elf ATOCHEM to reclaim the area, following its plan. He promoted a technical-scientific committee to direct the reclaim. The committee which is composed of technicians of the USLL 68 and 69 will give the results of his work(as soon as they will be available) to the European Commission.",

        "Finish Date": "2012-03-21 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "During the night of 20-21 March 2012 a waste incineration plant was programmed to burn solid rocket propellant, emulsion explosives, starter cartridges, smoke grenades, fireworks, airbags and lithium batteries.\nIn accordance with the programme, solid rocket propellant was first to be incinerated, followed by emulsion explosives, and finally the batteries which were incinerated alternately with airbags. Video footage of the feeder unit and hopper chute revealed that during the feeding period, from 00:55 until the incident at 00:59, the maximum feed volumes established under the programme were not exceeded erroneously. Data curves do not suggest the occurrence of any relevant procedural or technical faults. According to the power input to the rotary cylinder, the rotary kiln was operating normally. The incident was triggered at the point at which explosive substances (approximately 2 kg) began to accumulate in the discharge hopper of the annular chamber.\nRetrospectively, it is impossible to say which substances and materials were present in the discharge hopper at the time of the incident, and in what volume and composition.\nA possible cause may have been emulsion explosives, airbag parts and lithium batteries. The discharge hopper, which was reinforced with refractory material, was destroyed by the explosion. The steel casing (approximately 10 mm welded steel) was ruptured at the weld seams and pressed or propelled against a nearby girder (steel, concrete), which was partly damaged in the process. Parts of it shot through a metal grating on the second level and struck the guide rail carriage.\nThe inspection flap on the discharge hopper was propelled 7 m across the hall. Electrical cables, control circuits and utility pipelines were damaged and partly destroyed by fragments of projected material. The blast wave damaged much of a non-load bearing partition wall (lightweight construction, insulated trapezoidal sheet metal). Parts of the discharge sluice system and refractory material torn from the ruptured kiln hood landed on the level below the kiln hood. The chute feed tube was apparently pressed upwards by the blast wave and torn from the flange joint.",
        "Causes of the accident": "It is no longer possible to establish the cause of the explosion.\nA possible cause was the fast tamped combustion of explosive substances. However, it may also have been an exploding lithium battery which was projected, e.g. by an exploding airbag.\nThe last item to enter before the explosion was an airbag.",
        "Consequences": "s. Accident Description",
        "Emergency response": "- Fire alarm activated by smoke detector due to steam and dust.\n- Automatic alert sent to fire brigade.\n- Coordination centre telephone information: \u2018no fire\u2019\n- Alert called off (fire brigade not yet dispatched). It was not necessary to deploy protective measures and/or rescue services.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The reconstruction of the kiln hood also included structural changes ensuring that no unincinerated explosive material can accumulate in the technically unavoidable annular gap between the rotary cylinder and the hood. This eliminates the cause established in an expert report, i.e. the accumulation of explosive material in the discharge hopper at the kiln hood. Consequently it is not possible for such damage to the plant to occur again.\nThe new design provides for a plug inserted approx. 250 mm into the front rotary cylinder. The gap between the rotary cylinder and the plug is only approx. 20 mm wide.\nThe high temperatures in the combustion zone in the rotary cylinder ahead of the plug and the small gap will almost certainly prevent unincinerated material from passing through the gap and entering the discharge hopper area at the kiln hood. In addition, the gap at the hood discharge hopper is reduced from 250 mm to approx. 50 mm.\nAdditional organisational measures will ensure that no material can accumulate in the hood discharge hopper. Control and cleaning cycles will be laid down to match the material being handled. The volume of material discharged will be monitored and the discharged substances checked for unconverted waste and explosive material.\nTo monitor the condition of the rotary cylinder as regards wear and deposits during plant operation, the new kiln hood design provides for suitable means of inspection. This ensures that the condition of the rotary cylinder is checked regularly.\nThe risk assessment for the necessary checks and the procedure for emptying the discharge hopper have been adjusted accordingly. The damage was mainly confined to the secured, physically separate kiln area. In future this will continue to be secured by means of technical and organisational safety measures such as a ban on entering the kiln room when discharging waste, defined safety times on completion of waste discharge and securing the kiln room with light barriers to switch off kiln feeding."

        "Finish Date": "2000-12-04 22:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "In a chemical factory, the rupture of a valve on a storage tank caused a butadiene release which emptied the tank.\n\nThe amount of released substance exceeded 5% of the upper threshold limit. Therefore, the accident has to be notified according to the criteria of Annex 6.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The brittle failure of the&nbsp; valve in question was caused by spontaneous polymerisation. The valve acted as a by-pass for a remotely controlled valve on the pressure regulation circuit inside the butadiene storage tank. The formation of this polymer, called \"pop\", inside the valve's bonnet&nbsp; was caused by:- The stagnation of butadiene: the valve, which was shut at the time of the accident,created a dead end section, without any circulation of the substance;- The ambient temperature;- The absence of inhibitor (tert-butyl - cathecol): this storage tank does not contain any inhibitor because the butadiene comes from the re-condensation of a gaseous phase, and the inhibitor is eliminated during this process.The increase in volume during the polymerisation caused a considerable rise of the inner pressure, causing the brittle failure of the cast iron valve; the valve's bonnet was torn off.",
        "Consequences": "Nobody was injured in this accident. Some inhabitants of the neighbouring city complained about the smell caused by the release, since butadiene can be smelled above 2 ppm, while the lower explosives limit (LEL) concentration  is 20000 ppm. According to the plant operator, the  explosimeters detection threshold, set at 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL), was not reached.",
        "Emergency response": "The internal contingency plan was put in action and the operator set up a&nbsp; central command post on the site. The production units were shut down, water curtains were set up around the storage tank. The external fire brigades arrived around 18:50. Road traffic was stopped South of the site at 19:10 and South East of the site at 19:35. The TGV high speed train line was closed at 20:00.Random explosivity measurements were carried out around the establishment from 19:10 on&nbsp; by the operator, and from 20:00, in a more organised way, by the external fire brigades and by the on site fire brigades.All emergency response measures ended around 22:30.On request by the Classified Installations Inspectorate, a study on the atmospheric dispersion of the butadiene cloud was carried out, in order to determine whether the cloud which dispersed towards the South / South-East could have generated an explosion off-site, and to evaluate whether the population exposed to the cloud's passage may have suffered irreversible health effects.This study highlighted the fact that the explosiveness areas did not cross the property limits. As to the irreversible health effects (IDHL) zone, it seems that it extends a little outside the property limits, however it does not reach any residential buildings outside the site.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In addition to the accident analysis, the Regional Directorate For Industry, Research and Environment (DRIRE -- Direction REgionale de l'Industrie, de la Recherche et de l'Environnement) which is responsible for the inspection of classified installations, has requested the company to present a plan for the prevention of similar accidents.The following measures have been taken:* Inventory of similar configurations for the complete U400 production unit, according to the following criteria:- Presence of dry or wet butadiene without inhibitor- Development of pop favoured by temperature- Development of pop favoured by the presence of a gas phase- Development of pop favoured if the output is low or nil (dead end section, upper taps of tanks in the gas phase, valves and fittings, etc.)- Cast iron valves and fittings* Analysis of the risks of the installations based on the following criteria:- Presence of dry or wet butadiene without inhibitor;- Development of pop favoured by temperature;- Development of pop favoured by the presence of a gas phase;- Development of pop favoured if the output is low or nil (dead end section, upper ttaps of tanks in the gas phase, valves and fittings, etc.);- Cast iron valves and fittings;* Analysis of the risks of the installations based on the following criteria:- Output conveyed;- Nominal diameter;- Line or tank pressure;- Volume involved in case of confinement;- Isolability: is there a means of insulating the critical point, is it accessible in the case of a leak?* Site inventory and analysis: machine checks, verification of the upstream/downstream pressure levels of identified points, manoeuvrability tests of valves and fittings at risk.- Similar configurations have either been removed for verification of the absence of pop, for cleaning where necessary and replacement in certain cases, or a functionality test has been carried out on the valves and fittings, allowing seizing or pop to be detected. In the case of a negative test, the valves/fittings have been removed and cleaned.- The [quarter-turn] valve in question has been replaced by a steel ball valve, pending a detailed study of the problem with the by-pass. Two other cast iron valves have been replaced.- The valve involved in the accident was not classified as critical. At the request of the DRIRE, a \"critical valves/fittings\" inspection plan has been completed on valves and taps which could present a risk of blocking by pop.Besides, the following additional preventive measures have been implemented:.- 2nd level measures realised by the company's inspection service;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .- Half-yearly functionality tests during operation;- Half-yearly dismantling for internal inspection during the 2 annual shutdowns.&nbsp; These last two measures are moved forward 3 months, in order to maximise the coverage of risk-relevant fittings- Replacement of the critical gate valves and of the cast iron fittings by steel fittings during the July 2001 plant shutdown;- Study of each dead end section in order to perform modifications during the July 2001 plant shutdown, in order to reduce \"pop\"-related risk. Lesson learned: the uncontrolled and spontaneous butadiene polymerisation phenomenon is a reality which must be considered and its scenario must be analysed, especially in valves used as bypass.This accident has highlighted organisational and safety culture-related problems which are at present under assessment, which should lead to the issue of a complementary decree within the framework of the decree of 10 May 2000 (Seveso II), as lessons learned from:* The lack of action by personnel during the release,&nbsp; to close a manually operated valve placed between the storage tank and the valve involved in the accident, which could have greatly reduced the quantity of substance released into the atmosphere;*The lack of the analysis of this accident scenario in the risk assessment studies leading to an educational and training gap in the personnel and to the assumption of an explosion hazard in proximity of the site ( resulting in the closure of the TGV high speed train line).* The position of the central command post set up by the operators, which could have been reached by the butadiene cloud* The anxiety among certain members of the population, as a reaction to the butadiene smell, caused by a lack of information.* The ill-defined limit between internal and external emergency plan, depending on the drift of the gas under the influence of changing winds* The improvement of crisis management (decisions were made only after excessive delays)* The interfacing instructions with the national railway company SNCF."

        "Accident Description": "Due to leakage of process solution emission of ammonia occured. The detailed course of the accident was as follows:About 7:00 a.m.,\u00a0after regular check of the installation, a worker reported to his superviser emission of\u00a0the process solution (containing ammonium carbonate). The emission occured in the upper part of the exchanger. The person responsible for maintenace works was called in deal with the damage. In the meantime the affected exchanger was being prepared for the examination and repair. The exchanger was rinsed/washed with water.\u00a0This task involved opening\u00a0and closing the proper valves on a pump and injection of water. After the exchanger had been washed, the process solution was added to the installation but with omitting the damaged exchanger. This allowed the maintenance staff to remove the isolation of the exchanger in order to examine it. After the examination of the exchanger was performed, it was decided that leakness would be temporary\u00a0stopped with a caulker band. In order to do this the internal recue unit was called. They noticed punctual leaks in a few places. Before they started sealing operation it was decided to rinse/wash the exchanger again (doing this twice, in the same way as for the first time). Whille the caulker band was installed inside the exchanger there was water at a low preassure. After installation of the band it was decided to check the tightness using water. It appeared that it was not tight enaugh becasue water was leaking. The worker closed one valve to stop the water flow. At the same time he also opened another valve allowing the process solution to get into the system. The other worker, not being aware that process solution was being injected, thought the tightness tests were going on so he cut (with the valve) the flow of the flow of the process solution. This caused the process solution to go the broken exchanger. Suddenly the upper part of the echanger ruptured causing the emmision of the process solution. Due to its evaporation toxic claud was formed. One warker fell down because of the gust that appeared. The other five workers were intoxicated. All of them were injured and taken to the hospital. The analysis of the caourse of the accident showed that together with the emission of ammonium carbonate also ammonia was released, most probably from the absorption column due to the fact that one volve was partailally opened. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "The\u00a0accident occured because\u00a0of the aging of the equipment.Direct causes were as follows:- technical failure of the exchanger due to thining of its sides/walls caused by corrosive impact of ammonium carbonate (the deatiled examination showed that the content of oxygen in th process solution significantly infuenced the corrosion rate/speed). - lack of a coordinator of the maintenance works,- lack of communication beetwen the workers operating the valves,- limitted possibilities for efficient protection (the workers did not use the gas masks eventhough they were available).",
        "Consequences": "\u00a0Due to the leakage of the process solution and ammonia 6 people were intoxicated. The injured people were hospitalized from 9 to 41 days. ",
        "Emergency response": "\u00a0On site emergency measeres were applied immidiately. The\u00a0activities taken involved the following:- the operation of the\u00a0installation was partially stopped and emptied,- activation of the water sprinklers in order to limit the\u00a0danger area.No\u00a0negative effects\u00a0reported beyond the establishment. The temporary stop of the exchanger on one of the sections did not interrupt the installation's operration and did not require stopping of the production. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "In order to prevent such accidents in the future the following activities have been taken:1. The accident was discussed with all the workers of the urea unit2. For the works in which more than one person is involved, obligation for appointing a responsible for switching/changing procedure. 4. Undertaking technical and organizational activities in order to limit the danger from working factilities/devices within the urea unit i.e.: measure of the thickness of the pipelines, monitoring of the pipelines and devices during planned stoppages (annually), analysis of the possibility of the current evaluation of passivation efficiency, updating the technological instructions and elaborating new ones.5. Analizing the possibility of introduction of\u00a0technological changes increasing the safety of the procedure for preparation of the exchanger during maintenance works."

        "Finish Date": "1993-05-13 14:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "At the beginning of the afternoon, the operator decided to clean the inside of a tank, usually containing sulphur chloride, with water. The tank was scheduled for repair works after the detection of an incipient crack on a weld. 2 days before the accident, the tank had been emptied and isolated. A 400 mm diameter manhole  was left half open. A connecting piping between the tank roof and an adsorption column captured the hydrochloric acid vapours. A more or less dense sludge, with an average thickness of 60 mm, was deposited on the bottom of the tank. The sludge contained corrosion products, sulphur chloride and a variety of other impurities. The day of the accident, at 13:30 h, a flexible hose was introduced  through the half-open manhole cover for the rinsing operation. The water flow was 2 l/s. After one minute, a dense white smoke  was blown out through the manhole. The water injection was stopped. The amount of vapour released was later estimated at 80 kg. The emission stopped 5 minutes after interrupting the water injection in the tank. The capacity of the adsorption column was sufficient to capture the residual vapours.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Although there have not been any serious off-site consequences, it is evident that the hazards of the neutralisation reaction were seriously underestimated during  the preparation of the repair operation. The current gas treatment installation used for gas released during cleaning operations is under-sized and the water curtain systems installed on the boundaries of the plant cannot completely avoid the atmospheric release of a vapour cloud containing water and hydrochloric acid.\nThe operators did not think that the acid vapour cloud had crossed the perimeter of the plant and did not inform the management.\n",
        "Consequences": "The cloud containing hydrochloric acid and sulphur dioxide which was not abated by the water curtains (sprinkling system), was shifted by the wind, and touched  the ground in the form of a fog or small acid water droplets. At 1.150 km from the plant, the pupils of a school were reached by the fallout in the playground. Several were affected and 24 of them were evacuated by the fire brigade to the nearest hospital between 14:20 h and 15:30 h. A medical examination determined the lack of any danger.",
        "Emergency response": "Specific operative instructions, clearly describing the procedures to be followed, had been issued a long time before the event. The instructions provided for in particular the setting up of significant means to fight an eventual release of acid vapours (aspiration, water curtains, monitors, sprinklers, etc. ). However, as explained before, the flow capacity of the water curtains was under-sized.\nThe local fire brigade intervened half an hour after the accident started (14:05 h), called by the headmaster of the school to assist the pupils. The inspection of classified installations was taken over by the warning system of the fire fighting at 14:28h. It took 2h to identify the establishment where the accident had occurred. \n",
        "Lesson Learned": "The following actions were undertaken:- modification of the response procedures,- increase of the personnel awareness on accident hazards,- improvement of the emergency communication in case of an accident.Following the inspection, an infraction report was issued against the operators due to the failure to inform the management and to organise emergency response measures in the case of an accident affecting the environment. A safety report has to be drawn up in the context of a new authorisation procedure as a condition for restarting the installation."

The steel works was closed for 6 days, the time required to assess the damage and repair the second crane (loss of production: 18,000 tonnes of steel per day). During this period, the blast furnace was set to minimal operation (4,000 tonnes/day) and cast iron was cast into ingots in external pits dug for the purpose, to be later extracted for re-working. These operations generated considerable dust nuisance.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The owner was required to carry out study of possible hazards on the site, in particular domino effects, and, in conjunction with the supplier of the overhead travelling crane, to ensure that similar situations could not occur in the future on this or other sites (design of the anchor plate, choice of the type and form of the components).&nbsp; \n\nThe rupture occurred in the transition zone between a longitudinal weld and its free-flexing extension.  Cracks going right through the plate were also found in the corresponding anchor plates of the twin overhead travelling crane n\u00b0563, provided by the same manufacturer and 5 years old. The crane was immediately repaired."

It was due to be replaced in September. As a result the other two are used.&nbsp;- a second one, which had been working for 18 months, started to malfunction. Several efforts were made to resolve the situation but overall it continued to produce excessive releases.&nbsp;- the third one, overloaded, also started to release excessive quantities.&nbsp;- from the 3rd August, the releases to the environment are substantial.&nbsp;- by the 8th August, the treatment works was no longer functioning properly: the effluent was not being filtered, nor was the biological treatment working.The situation was aggravated by poor communications between the fire service and the inspectors: the fire service were collecting dead fish before the inspectors knew of the incident. It was therefore only 4 days later that the operator stopped operations.",
        "Consequences": "More than 20 km. of river were polluted, killing the fauna and a part of the flora.

        "Causes of the accident": "A trained and qualified staff member had put the equipment into safe mode (shutting off the water, shutting off the bath heating) the night before the accident (as confirmed by the CCTV cameras). The guard patrols conducted up until 6:00 a.m. (i.e. for 9 hours after the production staff had left) did not notice anything anomalous.\nAccording to assessments carried out by the operator and the Industrial Risks Investigation and Analysis Office (BEA-RI), the fire appears to have broken out because of an electrical fault or electrical overheating linked to a metallic object being left on a tank. The procedure in place for closing down the workshops did not provide full protection against fire risks, and some electrical components (rectifier/filters) were still live as a result of how the installation was designed. In addition, the linear smoke detectors and optical flame detectors in the workshop did not detect the fire. This is because they had been inadvertently rendered inoperative due to being poorly positioned following works carried out a few months previously. This meant that the fire was not detected during the 90 minutes before the whole line caught fire.\nThe procedure in place for closing down the workshops did not provide full protection against the fire risks, and some electrical components (rectifier/filters) were still live as a result of how the installation was designed.",

Water then spreads through technical galleries and floods the site. The operator triggers his rescue plan on 01/06 at 10 am and decides to evacuate his staff. At 2:55 pm, a power loss occurred and the generators took over. The maximum height of water reached at the lowest point of the site is of the order of one meter at the level of the southern zone of the site (peak of the flood the 02/06 at 8 am).",
        "Causes of the accident": "The peak of the SEINE river in Paris is equivalent to the peak of 1982 (6.10 m as against 6.18 m), but the floods of some of its tributaries have reached levels above 1910 (notably for LOING).\nThe origin of the rise of the waters is an exceptional level of precipitation over the month of May (the largest ever recorded), with, since the weekend of 28-29 May, a strong stormy period followed by several days of intense precipitation.\nThe flooding of the site was characterized by a rise of underground water with an overflow of the LOING.\nWater then stagnated at the site. There was therefore no effect of current capable of carrying ice jams that could damage the installations.",
        "Consequences": "No significant impact on the environment, nor human and social consequences are observed as a result of the flooding of the site. Finally, the operator did not detect aberrant signals (alarms, measured values, etc.) during the restarting of the installations.\nThe economic consequences are estimated at several million euros. Much of this is related to business losses. The material damage is comparatively lower.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;A period of partial unemployment affecting 78 employees is observed.

        "Start Date": "2000-09-25 10:50:00",
        "Finish Date": "2000-09-25 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Collision of a lift truck with a 0,75\" bypass pipe caused release of a spray of dangerous substances (pressure 30 bar), through a 1 cm2 hole. Calculation indicates that an explosive situation must have existed up to a distance of 24 meters from the installation.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Procedures prescribed that transport vehicles should maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from the installations. However, the truck driver miscalculated the distance or overlooked the presence of the bypass line. The truck was transporting a trailer with scaffolding materials, and these hit the pipe while driving by.",
        "Consequences": "Area concerned - Remarks: The truck driver\nresponded to the collision by immediately stopping the engine of the\ntruck, thereby possibly preventing an explosion.Material Loss - Remarks:29 tons of flammable and toxic substances were released, another 20 tons were destroyed by the emergency flare. Damage was mainly caused by production losses.People - Remarks:The truck driver escaped to the control room, he was not injured. Two operators closed the blockage valve under coverage of a water spray. All personnel was assembled, but not evacuated.A spray of dangerous substances was released, causing an explosive situation in the near distance of the leakage.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "The personnel of the site were assembled. The driver of the lift truck escaped to the control room and was unharmed. Measures were taken to reduce the pressure in the installation. Two operators closed the blocking valve, stopping the leakage.Emergency measures - Remarks: Because of the heavy spray it was not possible to immediately locate the exact source of the leakage, and to take the appropriate measures. The pressure in the epoxidiser was reduced by using the emergency flare. This reduced the spray, and consequently an attack plan could be made. Two operators closed the blockage valve under coverage of a water spray.Official action taken - other official action: Investigation of the incident by the environmental authoritiesSeveso II duties  - remarks: One of the remarks made\nby the assessment team was that a separate evacuation alarm is needed.\nThe actual alarm is meant to assemble, and if this alarm is sounded\nmore than 2 minutes, it is meant as an evacuation alarm. The assessment\nteam found this system inadequate in situations of acute danger (like\nthis incident).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: The work instruction is altered to enlarge the minimal distance between vehicles and the installation. To improve control of the number and kind of vehicles in the plant, each vehicle will be given a separate working permit. It is no longer allowed to give working permits combining maintenance and transport. The shielding of parts of the installation with high risk of collision is under consideration.Measures to mitigate consequences: Authorities will demand a separate evacuation alarm."

When the device went off, the roof of the gasholder peeled partly off, the upper lifts collapsed and approximately 33 tons of natural gas was released. The gas was immediately ignited resulting in an airborne fireball. The smaller adjacent gasholder experienced a seal fire and the larger gasholder, on the other side of the damaged one, was punctured in its third lift resulting in burning gas (jet-fire) from a hole with a release area of approximately 0.5 m2.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:The accident was caused by a terrorist explosive device (sabotage) placed on the side of the gasholder. The establishment security (the site was unmanned) was probably deficient.",
        "Consequences": "MATERIAL LOSS:One gasholder was largely destroyed, the adjacent two gas holders suffered minor damages. No data are available about the cost of the damages.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:200 people were evacuated from nearby houses: 60 of whom were accommodated in a local school for two nights; the remainders stayed with their relatives.People - Remarks: The site was unmanned. 20 firemen were involved to fight the fire. Consequences - Ecological harm - Remarks: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms. This is due to the low eco-toxic risks of natural gas.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The unmanned site was without an internal emergency plan. 20 firemen were involved to fight the fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:200 people were evacuated from nearby houses: 60 of whom were accommodated in a local school for two nights; the remainders stayed with their relatives.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "The incident was not covered by Health &amp; Safety at work legislation. When the Original Report was prepared, home office was investigating about the site security."

        "Accident Description": "As a result of the lower gas pressure and the prevailing squalls, the old roof tore. The raw biogas that was still present was released into the atmosphere and dissipated very quickly due to the strong wind.\nSafety measures:\n\nAs the gas had already been shut off, there was no immediate danger.\nIn order to prevent a further overflow of substrate from digester 4 into digestate store 4, the filling level of the digester was reduced by pumping.\nDigestate store tank 4 was emptied and taken out of service.\nReturn into service only after new roof fitted.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "Due to a low gas pressure, the film was not under tension but lying loose.As a result, it was particularly vulnerable to the pulling effect of the squall that was blowing (alternation between suction and slackening).This ultimately caused the sheeting to fail.\nThe condition of the foil, which was at risk of tearing due to its age, was a contributing factor, but with no acute risk potential.The sheeting was scheduled to be replaced as part of a rolling programme, but that had not yet been approved.",
        "Consequences": "Consequences DescriptionTorn roof with &euro; 25,000 of damage.",

        "Finish Date": "1991-02-21 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident occurred in one of the two glass lined storage tanks, 35 m3 capacity each, holding the recirculated acid solution (about 29% of sulphuric acid) used to absorb the residual ammonia from the gaseous effluents of the phtalocyamines process unit. This solution was enriched with ammonium carbonate coming from the ammonia treatment unit. The pH of the solution was manually controlled once per shift and adjusted if necessary by adding sulphuric acid solution so that the pH was maintained within the slightly acidic range (5 to 6). The solution's pH was periodically checked (every 8 hours) by an operator. When the accident occurred, the operator realized too late that the ammonium sulphate and ammonium carbonate solution was became basic and suddenly added a 60% sulphuric acid solution to it. This resulted in an abnormal production of carbon dioxide that overpressurized the tank which exploded because of inadequate pressure relieving capacity (the hydraulic trap with which the tank was equipped was not sufficient to withstand the peak pressure generated). The collapse of the tank caused the release of the solution (about 20 m3), which was partially recovered in the containment basin of the 2 glass lined tanks and partially in the yard. The rest of the solution was collected, through the sewer network, in the emergency basin of ACNA. All plants (except power plant and the oleum production plant) were shut-down in order to reduce the amount of effluents to the sewer network. This allowed the depuration of the ammonia solution released from the exploded tank and accumulated in the emergency basin avoiding, therefore, the pollution of the Bormida river. Samples taken from the river and analyzed by the local environmental authority laboratory (PMP of the U.S.L. No 7 of City of Savona) confirmed that the amount of solution spilled caused no environmental damage. Nobody was injured.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nThe operator realized too late that the ammonium sulphate and ammonium carbonate solution was became basic and suddenly added a 60% sulphuric acid solution to it.

The collapse of the tank caused the release of the solution (about 20 m3).\n\nCAUSES:\nThe accident was caused by an operator error that realized too late that the solution was became basic (the continuous pH monitoring was not foreseen) and added, by error again, a 60% sulphuric acid solution, resulting in an internal overpressurization of the tank due to the formation of carbon dioxide. Besides, the tank exploded because the pressure relieving capacity of the provided hydraulic trap was inadequate due to a wrong plant design.",
        "Consequences": "MATERIAL LOSS:No data are available about the cost of the material losses that occurred (collapse of the glass lined storage tank and release of about 20 m3 of solution).ECOLOGIC HARM:Samples taken from the nearby Bormida river and analyzed by the local environmental authority laboratory (PMP of the U.S.L.

Resulting fire burned for 18 hours before being extinguished.After loading a tank(no 12) with almost 1000 tonne of petroleum from a ship in the dock the line was pigged. The next stage was to insert a blind into the line between the dock line and the tank to prevent cross contamination. Valves B &amp; C had been left open from a previous operation&nbsp; and the non-return valve had been tied in the open position. When the blind (F) was opened a large quantity of petrol escaped from the tank and formed a vapour cloud which engulfed the operator. It ignited when it reached a diesel vehicle which had its engine running.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Main valve from the storage tank was closed but low point valves left open so when operator attempted to close Hamer blind (spade valve) high pressure escape of petroleum spirit produced large vapour cloud.",
        "Consequences": "People - Remarks: 7 firemen treated for skin burns from contact with run-off water contaminated with petrol/chemicals in bund. Operator killed followed by mayor fire brought under control by fire brigade only to increase intensity subsequently.Ecological harm - Remarks: Large quantities of protein foam and 40000 tonnes of water used in fighting fire. NRA permission obtained to allow contaminated run-off into river and sea.Disruption of community life: Adjacent LPG installation 4000 tonnes was put at risk from fire.Discussion of consequences: During the fire escalation occurred on at least 2 occasions. Had this further damaged the plant then loss of containment of the 1000 tonne tank into the bund could have followed. This in turn could have led to the loss of the other 1000 tonne tanks in the same bund.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of :       Ecological component: water catchment areas and supplies for consumption or recreation - Affected YesEcological component: marine or fresh water habitat - Affected Yes",
        "Emergency response": "10 fire appliances using pumps and foam equipment from Avon fire brigade along with British Aerospace foam generating vehicle (used for aircraft fires). Emergency on-site system for both GATX and the adjacent LPG plant belonging to BP instituted.Emergency measures - Remarks: Very prompt reaction by fire brigade in accordance with prearranged plan. 54 firemen and ambulance service and police involved.Official action taken - legal action: Prosecution of firm under Ss 2(1) and 3(1) of HSW Act 1974. Fine of 75,000 Pounds imposed on each charge (total 150,000 Pounds). Costs of 20,000 Pounds paid by firm.Official action taken - other official action: Prohibition notice issued preventing use of Hamer blinds unless proper arrangements for detecting pressure and collecting spillage are made. Notice complied with by replacing blinds with double block and bleed valves (cost 100,000 Pounds).Discussion about response: This major incident was a result of: 1) Poor choice of control equipment. The Hamer blinds were unsuitable for this type of control because they opened the system. 2) Inadequate systems of work which did not recognise potential for failure (the firms risk assessment only foresaw minor spillages); and 3) poor training and supervision (fire check non-return valves were allowed to be left open). A precis of the judges findings is attached for information.",
        "Lesson Learned": " Immediate prohibition notice on use of Hamer valve unless there\nis means for detecting pressure and safely directing material into\nclosed containers. There are issues here relating to other petroleum\nterminals elsewhere in the country who use this type of valve to close\noff lines.Measures to prevent recurrence: Routine opening of closed containment is unacceptable unless a strict operational procedure (written) is used. A much better system is the one now adopted (double block and bleed valves).Measures to mitigate consequences: The use of SPADE valves for these types of operation should be discouraged.Useful references: (1)  Loss Prevention in the Process Industries FP Lees 1989: (2)  Oil Industry Advisory Committee \"Guidance on permits to work\"; (3)  Institute of Petroleum model codes of practice Nos 2 and 19; (((4) Fire precautions at Petroleum Refineries and Bulk Storage Installations and Marketing safety code ))."

        "Accident Description": "Accidental spill of crude oil over a rain water drain, followed by a fire and an explosion in the Beach of Aterro near the refinery.For the unloading operations of crude oil through the Ocean Terminal of Leixoes (OTL), operational instructions were issued and distributed on 13/10/1998.The assistant manager of the logistics department and the manager of the Product Handling department worked out a document, dated 14/10/98, with the title \"Procedure for Setting the Pipeline under Pressure with Crude Oil\", concerning the operations of purging the soft water contained in the pipeline connecting the buoy with the refinery of Porto. The contents of the document remained known only to them. The document contained the pumping flow rate (ca. 500 m#/h), the volume of water to be purged (2900m#), the time estimated for purging the pipeline (ca. 6h), the frequency of supervisions of the system (in the first three hours not less than three times an hour; starting from the fourth hour continuous monitoring until conclusion of the purging), the circumstances for which the sewage treatment plant of the refinery would have to be contacted as well as the conditions under which the pumping operations would have to be stopped.On 14/10/98 at about 20:30 h the deputy captain of the ship Enalios Tethis signed a discharge protocol, named \"Operation Agreement &amp; Sequence Agreement\", according to the parameters agreed upon with the Product Handling department, without making any reservation from the part of the tanker concerning the assurance of minimal flow-rate of 500 m#/h .Once the unloading started, the CLT informed the Product Handling control room that according to the information given by the ship, the pumping flow-rate corresponded to 300 m#/h.The assistant manager of the Logistics department requested around 21:05 from- CLT an increase of the flow rate to 500 m#/h. He again requested the control room to confirm jointly with the CLT the flow rate, because the level in the channel was already reaching half level.Around 21:15 the manager of the Product Handling Department communicated to the operator of the waste water treatment plant that the water which was being purged was clean, so that drain 25 (rainwater) could be diverted from the storm-water basin to the sea, an operation which was performed.Around 21:20 the ship informed CLT that pumping was being carried out with a flow rate of 500m#/h , information which was transmitted to the control room of the Product Handling department.Around 21:40 the assistant manager of the Logistics department requested an increase of the pumping flow rate of further 100 m3/h, having observed that in the purging zone (zona di spurgo) the water remained clean and that the level in the channel had increased to near to reach its maximum level; he also requested the CLT to confirm the flow rate. Around 21:45 the deputy captain of the ship informed that the pumping was being carried out at a flow rate of 650 m#/h. After having established that the channel could not contain a higher flow rate, the assistant manager of the logistics department requested not to increase the flow rate any more and, in case of any variation, to reduce it. Instructions were issued to the ship not to exceed a flow rate of 700 m#/h.During shift change at 22:00, the operation coordinator was informed about the situation and it was particularly recommended to him that \"if traces of oil appeared, to request U 7000 (on-site waste water treatment plant) to divert drain 25 to the storm water basins, and after 24:00 to divert the drain to the storm water basin in any case even if no oil spot appeared\".The operator of the waste water treatment plant declared that at 22:30 he saw traces of hydrocarbons in the water flowing in the outlet box of drain 25 towards the rainwater drain; he then went to the storm water basins to ascertain the situation. Around 22:40, he alerted by phone the control room of the Product Handling department and started the operations for diverting drain 25 from the rain water drain to the storm water basin of the waste water treatment plant. Meanwhile, the operator of the Security Service passing near the control room was requested to check what was occurring in drain 25.At 22:45 the release of crude oil by drainage system 25 occurred.In consideration of this situation, it was ordered to divert drain 25 towards the storm water basin and to contact CLT to stop the pumping from the ship.At approx. 22:50 the operator of the waste water treatment plant performed the diverting operation of drain 25 from the rain water drain towards then storm water basins, but due to the high flow rate a part of the effluent was still discharged to the sea. It has not been determined if the operator acted following a specific order from the control room of the Product Handling department or if he acted on his own independent initiative. The operator declared that he acted on his own initiative. The Product Handling department declared on its side that a specific request had been issued.Around 23:05, the Product Handling department requested CLT to interrupt the pumping, which was carried out. The Product Handling department informed CLT that the deputy captain had communicated that until 23:00 2900 m3 had been discharged.Around 23:15 general alarm was released while the fire which had deflagrated on the beach of Aterro propagated through the rain water outfall to the rain water outlet box inside, the refinery .The fire was declared extinguished at 23:45.",
        "Causes of the accident": "- The ship did not respect the pumping program of crude oil, previously agreed between the involved parties to start operations; the permitted flow rate was exceeded by ca. 2.4 times.- The operating procedures drawn up for the Porto refinery were not extensive enough to maintain control of disturbances such as the one that occurred.No risk assessment was performed for setting the pipeline -under pressure (110107)The process for setting the pipeline -under pressure is based on the unloading flow rate of the tanker, a variable which was not controlled by the refinery and was not measured directly and with precision by the tanker. This procedure did not foresee any anomalous situation(110103).",
        "Consequences": "Off-site of the establishment:- serious injuries to two persons, causing the death of one- damage to the rain water outfall, at least 12 m 1200mm diameter tube needed to be substituted as well as damage to several inspection rooms.- contamination of sand and water, particularly on the beach of Aterro.Affected equipment: rainwater outfall and respective inspection rooms as well as the rain water outlet box of the waste water treatment plant inside the refinery.People - Remarks:The accident caused the death of one person, who was found near the exit of the rain water outfall and serious burns to another one who was found between the rainwater outfall and the shore; the person was hospitalised at the Coimbra hospital in a specialised unit for severe burns.The operator of the waste water treatment plant and the operator of the Security Service who were standing near the outlet box of the waste water treatment plant of the refinery shortly before the fire broke out, were considered as personnel exposed to risk.Ecological Harm - Remarks:The product which was not consumed by the fire, formed non-compact spots of crude oil/water emulsion which spread in North - South direction, along the coast between the beach of Aterro and the beach of Leca; a small spot of the same type spread also towards the beach of Angeira but was absorbed by the sea.155 tons of contaminated sand were removed from the beach during cleaning operations and were given to a licensed company for treatment.Material Loss:Onsite material loss: 300,000 EurosOnsite cleanup: 9M EurosOffsite:Emergency response 8.16M EUROCleaning and Remediation restoration1.38M EURORepair works to the rainwater outfall 313.000 EURO Affected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "When the contamination of the water in the rainwater drain was detected, it was diverted to the storm-water basin of the waste water treatment plant of the refinery and the pumping from the tanker was stopped.The on-site emergency plan was activated when the fire started on the beach of Aterro. The local authorities were also alerted in order to activate the off-site emergency plan.Extinguishing foam was introduced in the rain water outfall to fight the fire at the beach of Aterro and, after the fire was extinguished, the feeding of foam was maintained in order to assure a complete covering with this extinguishing agent, so as to avoid the release of flammable vapours, which could re-ignite.During the extinguishing operations, approximately 50000 l of foaming agent were used to produce the extinguishing foam.The fire was declared extinguished at 23:45 h.Environmental damage caused by the spill of crude oil was not very serious, because of the amount spilled and the immediate start of operations to reduce the consequences and for restoration.Emergency measures - Remarks: The means involved in the fire fighting operations were the following :-- Human means- 6 members of the security service- 7 members of the emergency response team of the fire brigade- 5 members of the auxiliary group of the fire brigade-- Equipment- 4 fire fighting vehicles- 1 supply vehicle- 1 ambulance- 3 diesel engine generators (U-4501 A ,B, and C)- 1 electric pump (P-4508)- 48500 litres of extinguishing foam extract A3 SPThe chronology of the response operations was as follows:Around 23:05 on 14/10/1998, the Security Service operator appointed to the aromatic compound plant, contacted the shift manager of the Security Service informing him that crude oil was reaching U7000 through the rain water drain. The control room of the Product Handling department was immediately contacted. While the shift manager of the Security Service was going to inspect U7000, the Security Service operator who was already there, he informed the control room over radio that he saw a glimmer on the beach towards U7000.At 23:15, the general alarm of the refinery was released after confirmation of the occurrence by the shift manager of the Security Service.It was ordered to start the production of extinguishing foam with a fire fighting vehicle and to inject the foam in the rain water outfall through the corresponding&nbsp; outlet box .Meanwhile the shift manger of the Security Service instructed the Communication Centre of the Security Service to inform the fire brigade of Matasinhos-Leca as well as to activate the off-site emergency plan.The Security Service team and the members of the emergency response service (of the fire brigade) collaborated in the fire fighting operations, by introducing extinguishing foam into the rain water outfall and by taking preventive measures such as covering with foam the area surrounding the&nbsp; outlet box of that rain water outfall as well as the basins of U 7000 and also by creating water curtains. In order to protect the control room of U 7000 and assure a perfect coverage (protection) of the area of the beach and the sea affected by the spillage, the foam was introduced for a long time in the rain water outfall.At 23:45 the fire was declared extinguished and the situation was completely under control.Due to the continuation of the foam injection, the end of the emergency was formally declared at 01:45 of 15/10/1998.The seriously injured person was evacuated by the National Institute for Medical Emergencies to the Pedro Hispano Hospital and successively to the Unit for severe burns of the Coimbra University Hospital.The body of the deceased person was removed after the legal formalities had been performed in presence of a representative of the state attorney's office and a representative of the municipal health authority; an autopsy was successively carried out on the body at the Institute for Legal Medicine of Porto.The Northern Marine Department was in charge of assessing and controlling the pollution; operations started at 07:00 on 15/10/1998 with the identification of the spots and terminated at 12:00 of the same day by using the following boats: Barra de Leixoes, Barra de Viana, Leao dos Mares. Only one small spot, having an extension of 100 m, was observed near the shore; the spot was thin and not very large and looked like diesel oil. No other spots were detected between the estuary of the Douro river and the area in front of Cabo Mundo.Official action taken - legal action: Judicial investigation carried out by the state attorneyOfficial action taken - other official action: The General Direction of Energy withdrew the operation license of TOL (oil terminal)The Ministry of Economy created an investigation commission to define&nbsp; exhaustively the responsibilities related to the accident. The final recommendations of the related report were the following:Immediate actionsa) complete demolishing of the provisional drainage system up to 10\" gate valve connected to the 40\" diameter new pipeline.b) Setting up and approval of detailed operational procedures, including the procedures for discharging clean or emulsified water, and foreseeing future situations in which a new hydrostatic test may be requested.c) Development of more effective routines for verifying the technical capability of the tanker to control the pumping flow rates at any given time during discharge operations, if requested by the situation. d) Definition of adequate routines for the documentation of the entire process of working out and authorising operational procedures or working instructions, respective discussion and familiarisation of the workers directly involved (documenting the operation), particularly for exceptional tasks.e) Revoke the withdrawal of the operation license of the TOL (oil terminal), ordered in resolution No. 9/98 of Director General of Energy dated 15/10/1998, considering the necessity to operate TOL (the oil terminal) for supplying the refinery with raw materials; the analysis of the accident causes and all other elements collected during the investigation have clearly established that the operation of TOL (oil terminal) in normal condition does not represent any major risk (the successful unloading of the crude oil after the accident confirms it).Medium term actions:a) Planning of integrated measures for risk assessment inspections, carried out&nbsp; by independent and competent authorities with the goal of assessing the integrity of the existing transfer installation for the crude oil unloaded for the refinery and the respective storage systems, and more specifically with regard to the respective state of corrosion.b) Conclusion of the revision process of procedure DGRP 090.06/19994 - issue and approval&nbsp; of study requests and execution of studies concerning specifically the adoption of appropriate methodologies for the evaluation of operational risks.c) Realisation of an external safety audit of the procedures and processes of the Petrogal Refinery of Porto and publishing of the results.d) Study and revision of the&nbsp; framework for the initial and subsequent licensing procedures for similar installations, considering both the safety aspect and&nbsp; the legal aspect, which normally foresees the appointment of a legal party responsible for collecting all advice involved and the initial definition of all parties to be consulted.&nbsp;- Follow up and verification of the implementation of the actionsThe Investigation Commission proposed the setting up of a follow-up commission,&nbsp; with the participation of the Municipal&nbsp; Chamber of Montesinhos, with the goal of monitoring the implementation of the recommended actions, and in particular of guaranteeing the population the safety conditions which legitimately can be expected from an industrial installation of this type.Concerning the methodology to be adopted for the implementation, it was proposed to work out a report documenting the implementation of the recommended measures, directly under the responsibility of the Refinery Manager.This report will have to document all the measures taken to eliminate the risk of the occurrence of similar accidents and discuss the degree of effectiveness of such measures and the possibility of maintaining them over time.The report will have to contain at least:- A review of the main and secondary hazard sources- A review of all key factors or critical points identified, all preventive measures&nbsp; taken, the degree of effectiveness of such measures and the possibility of maintaining them over time..- A matrix listing the original recommendations, responsibilities for the implementation, and measures taken to comply with each recommendation. The matrix will also have to include any other measure requested by any other official authority, in the case of there being some.The refinery shall present immediately to the licensing authority, within a period of not more than 8 days, a summary report of all accidents which involved the activation of the on-site emergency plan; this shall not interfere with&nbsp; the works of the Follow-up Commission.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: - Complete the project to motorise all large sized block valves, in order to reduce response times in closing/opening, particularly in case of an emergency.- Assure that before all modifications concerning operational procedures or design modifications are carried out, a risk assessment is performed.- Resize and automate the diversion system of the rain water drain to the waste water treatment plant, so as to assure that no hydrocarbons may be accidentally released to the sea over the rainwater outfall.- Work out on-site regulations on the use of draining systems, integrating all separate operating instructions, which already exist.- Any operation not specifically mentioned in the manuals or described by the operational instructions will have to be documented with a written procedure which will have to be approved by all parties involved and in the case of the involvement of a third party by the management of the refinery."

        "Finish Date": "1986-02-13 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nDuring the discharge of liquid chlorine from a road tanker to a storage tank the vent valve on the transfer line was opened allowing liquid chlorine into the main vent. There was flash vapourisation of liquid chlorine and the pressure surge resulted in damages to caustic absorption, bleach and hydrogen chloride columns. The damages and also the failure of liquid loop seals resulted in a leak of gas (mainly chlorine) within the chlorination plant building and in a localized area immediately adjacent to the plant. Some hydrogen chloride may have been emitted for a short time as a result of the failure of the hydrogen chloride column and column loop seals before automatic isolation took place. The leak was isolated and water sprays were used to minimize the effects of residual fumes.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nDuring unloading, vent valve on transfer line was opened when it should have been closed allowing liquid chlorine into the vent main. Flash vapourisation of liquid chlorine caused the observed damages and emission to atmosphere.\n\nCAUSES:\nThe accident was caused by the error of an experienced operator (in leaving the vent valve opened during unloading) together with a wrong system design which made it possible to vent with open storage tanks.",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:Inside the establishment 6 people were hospitalized and 2 received first aid due to the toxic release.MATERIAL LOSS:The pressure surge caused by the flash vapourization of liquid chlorine resulted in damages to caustic absorption, bleach and hydrogen chloride columns in the vent system. No data are available about the cost of the damages.Disruption of community life: The emergency controller contacted the neighbouring factories.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:'General Emergency' and 'Major Emergency' alarms sounded. Works emergency team mobilized. Water sprays were used to dilute toxic cloud. 2 people required first-aid with oxygen.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:London fire brigade were alerted. Emergency controller contacted neighbouring factories.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).Emergency measures taken Offsite: sheltering: public alerted directly by emergency servicesEmergency measures taken Onsite: internal systems: drenching systems (water sprays, monitors, etc.)Emergency measures taken Onsite: internal systems: alarms/sirens soundedEmergency measures taken Onsite: internal systems: internal emergency teams (fire, ambulance, etc.)Emergency measures taken Onsite: external services: external fire-fighting services",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:After the accident, the following measures were established:1- the discharge procedure to be re-examined and a discharge action check list&nbsp; introduced which requires a signature by the supervisor;2- a visual alarm to be fitted to the discharge pipework vent lines (a light flashes as soon as the vent lines are opened indicating that a venting operation is in&nbsp; progress). The sound operation of this system has been incorporated into a check procedure prior to discharge;3- correctly sized orifice plates to be fitted into the vent lines to prevent the over-pressurization of the absorption columns should the vent valves be wrongly open or opened.When the Original Report was prepared also the following actions were to be evaluated:4- the provision of a liquid gas separator on the vent line (a suggestion from the recommendation contained in draft \"Safety advice for bulk chlorine installations\"). The separator is to be fitted with a temperature alarm which could then be connected to an automatic isolation valve;5- the provision of a logic interlock system to automatically control the complete discharge (this system built in fail-safe devices in the event of failure).The company decided to engage Courtaulds Engineering ltd bringing forward their hazard operability study for their \"safety case\" and the whole of the plant had to be thoroughly investigated."

        "Accident Title": "Loss of containment from the agitator nozzle flange on the top of a vessel processing cyclohexane",
        "Start Date": "2006-02-19 05:55:00",
        "Finish Date": "2006-02-19 08:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "The incident resulted in a loss of containment of cyclohexane.  Exact quantities are not clear at present but best estimates are in the region of 10 to 24 tonnes.  Total plant inventory is 1100 tonnes.  The qualifying quantity is 50 tonnes as the material is held above its boiling point.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The exact circumstances are still under investigation but the basic facts are as follows:The incident occurred at an agitated process vessel which processes cyclohexane on a continuous basis at high temperature, i.e. above boiling point. The cyclohexane vapour escaped from an agitator nozzle flange on the top of the vessel. The failure occurred because the agitator suffered some damage, which caused the agitator shaft to distort, applying stress on the flange, loosening the studs, and allowing the flange to lift and the vapour to escape.The release was detected by a flammable vapour detector sited close to the agitator, which alarmed in the control room. Operators went out onto site to investigate and could see that a cloud of cyclohexane vapour was filling a proportion of the plant structure and was also drifting off the installation, although vapours were not seen to travel beyond the site boundary.The operators initiated the Emergency Response Procedure. The release was tackled by:(1) attending the site of the incident and setting up water sprays to cool and knock down the vapour cloud; and(2) initiating a shut down and depressurisation of the system to restrict the quantity released.",
        "Consequences": "There were no injuries or lasting environmental harm, and no disruption to the local community.&nbsp; Those employees who carried out the emergency response were shaken, and some suffered the effects of inhalation of vapours but were otherwise unharmed. The material loss was difficult to calculate because the loss was relatively small compared to the size of the plant inventory.The lack of disruption was partly due to the time of day, i.e, 6.00 am on a Sunday morning.The plant suffered some consequential damage, which resulted in it being shut down for repairs. ",
        "Emergency response": "The on-site emergency response procedures were followed.&nbsp; The off-site response was not invoked.The release was identified quickly by gas detectors located close to the source of the release. The plant operators and the Wilton site fire team drenched the vapour cloud with water sprays. The control room shut down and depressurised the plant. The County Fire Brigade came to site and observed.The release was brought under control within about one hour, and the incident was closed down within 2 hours 30 minutes.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The risk of similar failure in the same vessel and in an identical vessel was addressed before start up by removal of the agitators from the system.&nbsp; The process will run without agitation.The risk of similar failure in other agitated vessels on plant was addressed before start up by carrying out inspection of existing agitators on site.&nbsp; No others were identified of a similar design. Maintenance regimes were reviewed in the light of the incident.The emergency response was reviewed before start up and changes were made to procedures.An investigation into the root causes and overall standard of control and mitigation measures is underway."

        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:For preventing such incidents as the one of 21.01.1992, it was decided to install an extended CO-warning system and a disconnection device. The realisation of these measures has to be done not later than 09.06.1992. It was established that:- after start up of the plant during the first charge the packing has to be checked by a CO-detection device to examine the tightness and enter the result in the protocol;- after opening of an inspection valve it is fundamental to set in a new packing (renewed indication);- for the maintenance, only persons confident with the plant are to be employed.",
