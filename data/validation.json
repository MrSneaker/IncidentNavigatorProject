        "Accident Description": "Explosion and fire of hazardous chemicals storage hangar (hangar A), caused by the release of sodium chlorite from metal drums, hit by an erroneous operation of a forklift. The explosion, triggering a domino effect involving other drums and bags containing hazardous chemical products present in the hangar, caused the collapse of the hangar due to the pressure wave. The collapse of the structure caused the death of the operator crushed by the debris. The pressure wave injured a second operator who was hospitalised and dismissed in the evening. The pressure wave damaged also the adjoining solids storage hangar, causing the collapse of part of the structure, and ignited some small fires due to spark projection. The fire brigade declared that a mushroom cloud developed having initially a clear colour (presumably deriving from dust generated by the collapsing hangar) and then changed into black smoke deriving from the combustion of the chemical products,Activation of the onsite emergency response plan and immediate intervention of the external fire brigade teams from different command posts of the province of Varese and other provinces. The Regional Environmental Protection Agency (ARPA)of Lombardy intervened for monitoring the air quality in the area nearby the collapsed hangar. - Securing of the establishment and containment of the sewage system.The fires were almost extinguished in the afternoon. Activation of the offsite emergency response plan with intervention of police forces and local authorities.Successive monitoring of waste waters in the post emergency phase.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Storage hangar for hazardous chemicals The explosion and fire occurred in the storage area of comburent agents, and in particular in the storage area for sodium chlorite pellets in the form of crystalline powder, in this area there two elevators were operating with two operators (one of which deceased and the other was injured)The reacted product (sodium chlorite) was released by one or more metallic drums containing 50 kg each.Wrong operation of a forklift in the comburent area causing the impact of the forklift with drums containing sodium chlorite causing the release of sodium chlorite.Ignition of the product, 2 operators escaping towards the fire shelters, first deflagrations one of which projecting one of the operators outside of the hangar injured, whereas the other is killed by the debris of the collapsing building (1 fatality)&nbsp; Determination of exact accident causes will be possible only after the conclusion of the accident investigation, which is in process.The post -accident investigations performed by ARPA (Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment) determined the presence of incompatible substances in the storage hangar, and in particular the presence of peracetic acid CAS&nbsp; 79-21-0. in the explosion point. Peracetic acid can cause an explosive reaction when getting into contact with sodium chlorite (CAS 7758-19-2).According to the NIOSH Material Data Safety Sheet sodium chlorite decomposes at 180-200\u00b0C producing toxic and corrosive fumes. It could be assumed that the sodium chlorite decomposed due to the initial violent exothermic reaction with the acid and then by the high temperature reached by the initial explosive reaction. The company declared that 30 t of sodium chlorite were destroyed by the accident, representing the entire quantity stored.The company admitted the presence of a 1000 l storage tank of peracetic acid at 15% outside of the storage hangar, - the tank was found damaged in proximity of the collapsed hangar,&nbsp; arguing further that the presence of peracetic acid in the explosion point could be justified by the extinguishing water used by the fire brigades.On the other hand all elements collected by ARPA indicate non correct management procedures of hazardous materials inside the storage facility.These statements are however still to be evaluated in the judicial procedure which is still in process.",

        "Finish Date": "2019-06-08 15:10:00",
        "Accident Description": "On 8 June 2019, a secondary reaction initiated by the addition of peroxide resulted in foaming of the mixture in a reactor vessel. The workers noticed that the mixture was behaving peculiarly, i.e. the manometer on the reactor vessel was showing a sharp increase in pressure. The shift supervisor was informed. He immediately called the emergency services.Duration of the incident: 10 minutes.\nThe planned addition of the secondary initiator led to an increase in pressure and temperature in the reactor vessel and then to the release of pressure via the rupture disc into a catch tank (with a volume approximately 2.5 times that of the reactor vessel) and then, in turn, to a release of pressure into the atmosphere via a rupture disc in the catch tank. The triggering of the rupture disc was signalled in the process control system. Approximately 5,500&nbsp;kg of ethyl acetate escaped and evaporated, carrying with it product components in the form of droplets. An area of approximately 60,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 to the north of the factory site was contaminated. As the substance is not water-soluble, no water pollution (through rain) has taken place. Nobody was injured.\nSafety measures:Excessive pressure in the reactor vessel is released by means of a safety valve and rupture disc through a pipe into a catch tank. Excessive pressure in the catch tank is, in turn, released into the atmosphere by means of a safety valve and rupture disc.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Subsequent reconstruction established that there had been a mix-up with the tanks at the start of the procedure when preparing the solid peroxide, which first had to be dissolved in ethyl acetate. Workers on the early shift correctly put the ethyl acetate solvent into holding tank 1, but incorrectly put the solid peroxide into holding tank 2. It should also have been put into holding tank 1. Consequently, no reaction occurred. Workers on the following shift checked holding tank 1 to see whether the peroxide had dissolved. However, it was not possible to tell from a mere visual inspection that the tank contained only liquid ethyl acetate. As a result, the product batch did not achieve full conversion as expected, which meant that, when the peroxide for the secondary reaction was added, the conversion suddenly took place more vigorously than expected, with the effects described above.",
        "Consequences": "On-site:One person twisted their ankle during the evacuation, no injuries, staff could resume their work later.\nMinor damage, replacement of the broken rupture disc, repairs, and testing and cleaning costs. Costs: EUR 20,000.\nOff-site:One woman had matted hair.\nContaminated area with a radius of 300 m NNE.

        "Emergency response": "The volunteer fire brigade was alerted, the production building was evacuated, and the neighbouring processes in the hall of the production building were shut down. Air testing was carried out by the volunteer fire brigade after the incident, and no adverse effects could be detected. The public was warned by radio, and windows and doors in the surrounding area were closed.\nThe contaminated areas were assessed by the insurer\u2019s experts and there were direct reports of damage by those affected. The insurance will cover the clean-up costs and deal with the external damage that occurred.\nIt has not yet been possible to identify any specific surface contamination, but this is very likely to be detectable on roof tops. What measures will need to be taken cannot yet be determined.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Expert recommendations:\n\nClear labelling of the reactor vessel tanks.\nHarmonisation of the labelling on site with the production specifications, the batch protocols and the process control system (PCS); harmonisation with other plant documentation.\nTraining workers to apply the \u2018second pair of eyes\u2019 principle; differentiation between critical dosages/additions (checked by the shift supervisor in accordance with the \u2018second pair of eyes\u2019 principle) and less critical dosages/additions (checked by two shift workers in accordance with the \u2018second pair of eyes\u2019 principle), with documentation of this by the plant manager/production manager in the production specifications/batch protocols.\nBolting shut any unused manholes/handholes on the tanks.\nDispensing is to stop automatically if it is not confirmed by a worker that the reaction has started.\nSetting out the criteria in the production specifications/batch protocols for determining whether the reaction has started.\nAs with the reactor vessel, the start of the reaction should be shown in the PCS.\nAssessing the accumulation of pressure during the course of the reaction in order to ensure that the rupture discs are of a sufficient size (maximum accumulation of 15%); reviewing existing procedures; for new procedures before the Research &amp; Development Department starts production.\nIn the short term, implementing an automatic trigger for the addition of an inhibitor.\nModifying the catch tank.\nInstalling a cyclone separator downstream of the catch tank.\nReviewing and evaluating the catch tank with a view to optimisation; implementing any necessary improvements.\nReviewing and revising the production specifications and the batch protocols.Risk analyses (HAZOP) for defined reference procedures to define requirements for process control technology and safety-oriented controls.\nDrafting and implementing instructions for identification of key safety data for new procedures by the Research &amp; Development Department before production starts, as well as determining the responsibilities and other content.\nRisk analyses should be carried out before new production procedures become operational in the production process; instructions setting out actions and responsibilities should be drawn up and implemented.\nAs part of the HAZOP studies and the revision of the explosion protection document, the issue of \u201cadding a solid to a container of flammable liquid\u201d should be considered and safeguards should be put in place. These should also be implemented for existing procedures. The explosion protection document should be revised.\n\nAdditional measures taken by the operator:\n\n&nbsp;Safety data sheets are stored on the intranet.\nA brief overview of safety data sheets for new raw materials is provided in the Health, Safety, Environment (HSE) / Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) software.\nThe tasks of the shift supervisors are being redefined.\n\nOptimisation of the catch tank with regard to separation of the liquid/gaseous phases."

        "Accident Description": "Buried for 36 years at a depth of 2.5 metres at a Seveso site for the liquefaction of air for the Lorraine industry, an oxygen (O2) pipe with a pressure of 40 bar exploded at 13:45 at the boundary of the property, at its point of entry into concrete culverts under a railway track belonging to the factory.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Intermediate expert reports point to poor laying, the quality of the soil/backfill, differential compaction of the layers of the subsoil, which was of poor quality due to the railway track... Phenomena that would have been visible at the surface, but were not reported, according to the expert, who supports the hypothesis of corrosion aided by prolonged immersion in water due to a fluctuating and shallow (- 2.2 m) water table (Moselle region), sulphate reducing bacteria or chlorides, which would explain the pitting on the outer surface of the pipes. The investigation also revealed a section of the pipe that had been replaced (and was thicker) 5 m from the rupture and the unexpected ovalisation of one end of the pipe.\nThe final expert report regarding metallurgical matters revealed several combined factors: failure of the impermeable membrane of the sleeve, groundwater fluctuations in the sleeve, creating environment discontinuities for the electrolyte and reduced cathodic protection, localised degradation of the covering combined with separation of the tar. After water had come into contact with the tar/steel interface, a nascent corrosion pierced the pipe, and a small release of O2 thereafter accelerated the phenomenon.\nAccording to the records, there was neither mechanical disruption (construction work) nor excess pressure. The environmental administration received a report on the accident (including the emergency response plan and a technical dossier about the pipeline. The removed pipes stood in the open air for two months before being delivered to the experts. Having noted generalised corrosion in August, the environmental administration demanded that they be put under cover.\n",
        "Consequences": "A 1 m segment of \"unrolled\" oxygen pipe lies in a pool of water. A crater (diameter 7 m / depth 3 m) was formed, mud and pieces of road surface and concrete were hurled 50 m, and pieces of debris weighing 1 and 15 kg were thrown 60 and 30 m respectively. A nearby concrete wall was partially destroyed, and the fence was damaged. The TNT equivalent is estimated to be 0.14 kg. There was no visible flame emanating from the pipe, but a 220 / 24 V transformer 3 or 4 m away caught fire. The pipe was emptied over a distance of 13 km, releasing 257 tonnes (180 000 m3) of O2. The damage was valued at 1.05 million euros.\nAn uncovered O2 pipe and an N2 pipe also passing through concrete beneath the rails were near the damaged structure. The nearby N2 pipe that feeds the safety systems of several sites could have been damaged, risking a rupture. This pipeline could not be closed off without causing a shutdown of the client installations.\n",
        "Emergency response": "The emergency response plan was activated, and the fire brigade and police intervened. At 14:30, a 26% level of O2 was recorded at a distance of 5 m from the isolated section. The operator informed its clients and issued a press release at 18:00 hrs. An uncovered O2 pipe and an N2 pipe also passing through concrete beneath the rails were near the damaged structure. The nearby N2 pipe that feeds the safety systems of several sites could have been damaged, risking a rupture. This pipeline could not be closed off without causing a shutdown of the client installations.\nThe environmental administration called for a security perimeter to be established around the oxygen pipe, a lowering of the N2 pressure and the installation of a security camera. Under the 'pipelines legislation', a prefectoral order confirmed these points and requested expert opinions on the metallurgy of the damaged pipe and the geotechnical aspects of the manner in which it was laid.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "The lessons to be learned include:\n- the activation of the emergency response plan (compulsory for upper tier Seveso plant), since the accident was on the edge of the factory's property, on a section of transport infrastructure and not a 'factory pipeline'; the extent of the following should be specified in the safety analyses: the degree of covering of the pipe in the emergency response plan.\n- safety studies regarding laying techniques and the local hydrogeological / geotechnical characteristics in order to better understand the geological uncertainty caused by groundwater fluctuations,\n- the distances of the effects of the 'violent rupture': crater, wall, projectiles. Besides the findings of the 'security studies' for the operator to verify, the ELS, PEL and IRE zones for such pipelines could be reviewed.\n- apart from contracted work or earth movements, corrosion as the initiator of a rupture.\n"

        "Accident Description": "Large flooding of Vltava River in August 2002 has inundated premises of the Spolana plant.During the flooding of the site between 14.8. and 18.8. 2002 water entered into establishments E 4990 and E 4920 and inundated the emergency retention sumps, in which are located the liquid chlorine storage tanks. Chlorine was released to the air and water on 15.8., 17.8. and 23.8. 2002.A class III chemical alert was announced on the 15.8. at 12.47. This alert was reduced to class II at 19.25 after sealing the establishment. Air in the sodium chloride storage was temporarily extracted on the 18.8.2002. The alert was reduced to class I at 11.58 on the 19.8.2002.The inside of establishment E 4990 was inspected for the first time since 14.8 in the morning of 23.8.2002.A further release of chlorine occurred during extraction of tank 7 in establishment 4990 on the 23.8.2002. A class III chemical alert was announced at 20.02. The alert was reduced to class II at 00.25. After extraction of the chlorine from the stabilized containers on 2.9. the alert was reduced to class I. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "Large scale flooding plus inadequate anti-flooding measures.Cause of accident:The containers were lifted by the force of the floodwaters, which lead to a burst in the piping and detachment of the socket on tank 10. The scale of damage and an approximation of the volume of released chlorine were made during the afternoon of the 23.8.2002 during the inspection of storage E 4990.",
        "Consequences": "People - Remarks: There was a minimum number of employees in the plant in the time of the event - rescuers, some managers. According to the results of air monitoring in the vicinity of the plant, the concentration of chlorine did not reach prescribed limits.Ecological - Remarks: Possible damage to the southern border of the protected region Cern&iacute;novsko. Evaluation of the entity of the damage will be possible only during the next vegetation period It is impossible to determine and single out the contribution of each one of the two release events occurred during the accident.Material Loss:15 claims for compensation of damage were made before 6.11.2002 summing up to 10.7 million CZK (eq. 346,273&euro; the 06.11.2002). Testing of these claims is underway. It is difficult to gauge which event originated the damage&nbsp; (in a number of cases it is necessary to evaluate the extent of damage by floods).",
        "Emergency response": "The operational control room at SPOLANA a. s. reported the accident on 15.8.2002 at 12.47 pm (Class III chemical alert) to the Melnik fire brigade. They remained in permanent communication until the end of the occurrence.&nbsp;Emergency measures - Remarks: Used code 7999 - in the time of the promulgation of the III.degree of chemical alert in SPOLANA a. s., that means on 23.8.2002 from 20:02 to 00:25, the people were required to leave the free spaces and to enter closed buildings.Official action taken - legal action: CIZP &nbsp;(\u010cesk\u00e1 Inspekce \u017divotn\u00edho Prost\u0159ed\u00ed - Czeck Environmental Inspection)&nbsp;started administrative procedures considering the case of the release of chlorine with SPOLANA a.s. The Police of CZ is performing an investigation because of the considerable threat to lives, health and propriety as a consequence of the flood.Passed through discussions in the directory of the plant and in the meetings of the directory and emergency staff.A III degree Chemical alert was declared as a precaution, however, the concentration of chlorine within the borders of the plant did not reached the threshold for this type of alert.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Technical measures to prevent events - inundation of the chlorine store: To separate constructions of galleries, so that the containers, when lifted, could not lift the constructions of galleries of neighbouring containers. To put the containers into special construction, which would hold the container inside and would prevent the containers being moved. Measures to mitigate consequences: Technical measures for mitigation of consequences in case of chlorine release: - To install, as a steady water screen, a dry air pipe system out of the store of chlorine with a possibility to connect it to an autonomous pump with a capacity determined by a project. - To limit chlorine storage only to the E 4920 building, that means a reductionto to 50% of original storing capacity. - To further investigate the possible risks in the chlorine storage by a form HAZOP. - To ensure suction of the chlorine deposit by other distribution tubes in sufficient height for a possible level of floodwater, so that it is possible to remove even if the retention tanks are inundated. - To install an autonomous monitoring of accidents with an uninterrupted source of electric energy, with a signalizing siren and a lighthouse to deposit E 4920. - To construct deposit E 4920 as sealed, with seals against extreme pressure and with a possibility to inundate in cases that the whole building could be lifted by floodwater. Organization measures - During any non-operation of the sodium hypochlorite plant for longer than 8 hours, carry out exhaustion of tube distributors into shut-off armature from the containers of chlorine up to the distributors. - Based on the results of a HAZOP study, draw up an appropriate operating regulation and put it into practice."

        "Finish Date": "2013-02-06 12:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "At around 8.00 a.m. a worker smelled mercaptans (highly odorous gas &lt; 1 ppb, toxic at high concentrations) in the zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) unit at a chemical plant producing additives for lubricants. He was taking a sample of a product that had been pending transfer for two days in the adjustment tank when the \u2018high temperature\u2019 alarm triggered in the control room. Around 9.00 a.m. tests confirmed thermal decomposition of the product. An attempt to render the gas inert by adding a mixture of zinc oxide and water failed at around 11.00 a.m. Technical difficulties delayed the preparation of the neutralising mixture in a mobile mixer: connection problem, mixture prepared too quickly. The scrubber overloaded and the odorous cloud escaped from the site.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Several causes were identified:\nOn Friday 18 January, a worker inadvertently started up the adjustment tank stirrer rather than the recirculation pump on the unit\u2019s control panel. After being transferred to the tank on Saturday morning, a batch of product at 94&nbsp;\u00b0C gradually heated up until Monday morning, when the thermal decomposition was discovered (T &gt; 110&nbsp;\u00b0C). The staff patrolling the site over the weekend had not noticed that the stirrer was in operation, despite the indicator light on the control panel being on and the shaft visibly rotating at the top of the tank.\nAs a storage tank had been filled and there was no demand, the operator stored some product in an adjustment tank whose transfer and recirculation systems were working on manual mode only following the deployment on Friday of a software security measure that deactivated the pump\u2019s remote control feature so as to prevent the storage tank overflowing.\n16 years earlier the tank had been transferred from another unit with a stirrer and heat insulator that were not suited to the current process; this had been done without a change management procedure.\nIt was unusual for the pump to be started up manually and the stirrer, which had in principle been put out of service in 2006 but was no longer shut down following poorly supervised maintenance, was started up by mistake.\nThe status of the stirrer was not recorded in the control room and the staff on watch had not been instructed to start it up manually or check it visually.\nThe risk analysis had not identified the risk of the ZDDP decomposing slowly at around 110&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nFrom the control room the temperature in the adjustment tank was checked only when the recirculation pump was stared up before manual sampling.\nThe measures planned for dealing with the decomposition stabilised the decomposition reaction without stopping it.\nThe scrubber was set up for a large-scale release of H2S (conservative toxic scenario) and was quickly overloaded when mercaptan emissions exceeded trace levels.",
        "Consequences": "The odours spread across the entire department before reaching the Paris area and the south of England overnight. Tens of thousands of people were inconvenienced, with some complaining of dizziness, headaches, vomiting, etc. A&amp;E services handled around 20 cases in the Rouen area.",
        "Emergency response": "The operator launched its emergency plan at 10.00 a.m. and informed the prefecture at around 11.30 a.m. 33 municipalities received automated emergency notifications. Other attempts at neutralisation late in the evening failed.\nA&amp;E services handled around 20 cases in the Rouen area. The prefect set up an information desk on the Tuesday morning and, as a precautionary measure, launched the external emergency plan at 10.35 a.m. Between Wednesday morning and Friday evening a new operating procedure made it possible to \u2018safely\u2019 neutralise, in 12&nbsp;t batches, the 36&nbsp;t of decomposing product before transporting it in trucks to an incineration plant.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The operator took out the tank\u2019s heat insulator, installed cooling devices that can be deployed in 15 minutes, modernised the running of the unit (block diagram and hierarchy of alarms for continuous monitoring of the temperature and rates of H2S/mercaptans at the stack, introducing redundancy for temperature measurements and making them more reliable, etc.), and recalibrated the scrubber to handle large-scale releases of mercaptans. The operator also improved the surveillance and intervention procedures for exceptional situations, stepped up awareness-raising and training for staff on emergencies, analysed the changes made to the other equipment installed 16 years earlier and improved the procedures for checking and testing equipment."

        "Accident Description": "During restart of a LNG production facility a fire occured in the air intake for one of 5 gas turbine generators. The fire caused material damage of the turbine air inlet and filterhouse, and the salty water used to extinguish the fire caused damages on electric and mechanical equipment. The LNG production facility has been closed since the accident occured, and was still not reopened by the end of 2021.&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "Self ignition of filters in the turbine. The self ignition was probably caused by accumulation of biomass (mainly insects) in the air inlet filters. This accumulation caused too high temperatures in the filters over a long period of time, and has probably also caused a change in the self ignition temperature of the hotoil.\nThe&nbsp; company report states that the incident was not caused by a single technical or human error, but was a result of several direct and underlying causes: design, decisions, operational practices, organisational conditions, conditions related to training, management and control, which together resulted in extensive damage to the plant. The direct cause of the fire was auto-ignition of the filters in the air intake of gas turbine generator no. 4 (GTG4), due to temperatures that were much too high over a long period of time. The underlying cause of the fire was the fact that the anti-ice heat exchanger was used outside its intended area of use, causing this high temperature. The high temperature in the filter housing was not detected.\n&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "The fire caused material damage of the turbine air inlet and filterhouse, and the salty water used to extinguish the fire caused damages on electric and mechanical equipment. The LNG production facility has been closed since the accident occured, and was still not reopened by the end of 2021.&nbsp;There were no injuries during the incident.\nThe fire has been classified by the company at the highest potential degree of seriousness under slightly different circumstances equal to the actual seriousness of the fire. Slightly different circumstances mean that it is only by chance that alternative outcomes of theincident did not occur, and not what could have happened in a worst-case scenario.&nbsp;\nThe total cost of this fire is estimated at 8,6 billion Norwegian kroner.",
        "Emergency response": "A gas alarm was immediately initiated. The alarm was quickly changed to an evacuation alarm, with a subsequent message over the Public Announcement system to evacuate the plant. Control room operators then initiated emergency shutdown (ESD2), notified the emergency services (triple notification) and started up the plant's active fire protection system (fixed monitors, programmed with oscillation). At the same time as ESD2 was activated, there was a power failure both in the plant and in parts of the nearby town. ESD2 caused all the turbines to lose supply of flue gas, and the power supply to the plant was cut off. This further resulted in the shutdown ofcooling water and instrument air.&nbsp;\nThe emergency response team (ERT) and incident management team (IMT) mustered in accordance with theinstructions. It was decided to use firefighting vessels to extinguish the fire instead of sending the local Fire Brigade into the plant out of consideration for the safety of the personnel. After these vessels had been in operation, the local&nbsp;fire brigade went into action at about 22.35 and foamed the area. In the emergency log, it is noted that the fire was confirmed extinguished at 23.20.",

        "Accident Description": "A violent explosion occurred in a dynamite cartridging workshop of an installation specialized in the production of this explosive.The site is classified under the Seveso II directive (upper tier)The accident&nbsp; caused 4 fatalities, all working on the site and employed by the company. On this account the accident is classified at level 3 of the accident gravity scale, as published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive.The quantity of reacting substance is estimated at approximately 100 kg of TNT equivalent (to be considered simply as an order of magnitude).&nbsp; On this account the accident is classified at level 2 of the accident gravity scale ( unless additional information becomes available on this point).The accidentOn 27 March 2003 at 06:16 h an explosion occurred in workshop no. 50. The noise was heard more than 10 km away.When the accident occurred, the adjustment operations were being performed on the machine, the shift had exceptionally started earlier (05:00 h instead of 07:00 h). The tuning phase took a bit longer than usual. At 06:16 h, the presumed time of the explosion, 4 employees were present in the workshop or in the immediate vicinity: the operator of the machine, an assistant, a person responsible for collecting the waste material and a mechanic who was passing in front of the workshop (on the right side of the tunnel). The 4 employees died in the accident. A large cloud of black smoke formed above the site but the fire was rapidly brought under control.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Several investigations were started following the accident: a judicial investigation, an administrative investigation and internal investigations by the operator. These investigations are still going on. The difficulty in looking for the causes of this kind of accident comes from the absence of direct witnesses and the destruction of the material elements. In this particular case two elements have&nbsp; contributed somewhat to reducing this difficulty: a witness went several times into the workshop during the hour immediately before the explosion (the worker of one of the kneading machine workshops who personally brought the paste containers to workshop no. 50) and the area around the Rollex machine was filmed by 4 cameras for monitoring operations from the control room and the images were registered. The analysis of the registrations shows that the initial explosion occurred in the feeder of the Rollex machine and then propagated to the other explosives present in the workshop. The explosion may have been caused by the presence of a foreign body in the feeder, which may have got stuck between the extruder screws and the metal body of the feeder. The experts cannot exclude a certain sensitivity of the dynamite although tests performed on the explosives produced when the accident occurred did not show anything abnormal.",
        "Consequences": "The accident caused the death of 4 persons in the workshop and in the adjacent premises. Significant damage is visible. The cartridging workshop was destroyed, craters can be observed there.\nIn the adjacent workshops, damage was serious but limited. The beams surrounding the workshop apparently reduced the effects of the explosion. Damage offsite consisted in broken windowpanes, displaced tiles (up to approximately 550 m). No domino effect was observed.\n\n\n",
        "Emergency response": "The on-site emergency plan was put into action by the operator. The fire was rapidly extinguished. About 60 fire fighters were involved in operations. The security perimeter initially established by the emergency service was lifted around 10:30 h. Traffic on the De\u00fble channel passing near the site was interrupted until 17:00 h.Site securing operations started immediately with the shutting down of the other workshops and in particular the nitroglycerine production workshop. These operations were continued until June with the recovery and destruction or finishing of the manufacturing in progress on the site, prioritising the operations according to the stability of the products (residual acids from nitration, then nitroglycerine, then dynamite paste..).Parallel to these measures and on the suggestion of the Classified Installations Inspectorate prefectural orders for urgent measures were issued asking for:-&nbsp; the definition and application of a schedule of measures for securing the site. - the carrying out of an investigation into the exact causes and circumstances of the accident-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the definition of measures needed to avoid recurrence of a similar event-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - safety inspection of&nbsp; the installations before any new start-upThe operator has planned to restart operations with a reduced production.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In a first accident report, the operator proposes the following improvement measures:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emptying of the pyrotechnic waste containers by the workers of each workshop or outside of normal working hours,2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setting up of a circulation and material flow plan of the workshops (witness lamp);3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modify or suppress the feeder system;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specification of a paste suited for machining (gluing, hardness);5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verify the suitability of the casing of the Rollex machines;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organise preventive inspections to check the state of the paste containers;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systematize the different phases of the testing procedure8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce the size of the feeders;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build the feeders in composite materials;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue the prevention campaign against foreign bodies started before the accident;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce the number of parts in the machines which can be dismantled;12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppress the toolboxes near the Rollex machines, and substitute them with toolboards having the tool-form outlined on the boards.13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Install electronic torque measurement instruments;14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise the shock resistance thresholds in the compounds, investigate pastes with a higher tolerance to delays in processing;15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modify if necessary the waste material recovery containers under the machines16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigate the pyrotechnic characteristics of a compressed paste17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply the information contained in the documentation on chicanes for corridors and protected access ways "

        "Finish Date": "2012-07-20 19:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "At about 11:40 on 20 July 2012 there was a breakdown in the loading area where aromatic hydrocarbons were being loaded. This was triggered by an unexplained malfunction of two quick-closing valves which are installed to protect the pipeline at a ship loading facility. The closure of the valves resulted in an increase in pressure in the loading pipeline. As a result of this increase in pressure the pump housing ruptured and approx. 20 to 24 t of the product entered the catch basin in the pump house and two unused tanks.\nThe increase in pressure also resulted in damage to the transport pipeline about 250 m away from the pump. This damage was caused by corrosion resulting from faulty external insulation. The leak resulted in about 200 l of product being released from the damaged pipeline and entering the soil. No conclusive reason for the malfunction of the quick-closing valves could be found.",
        "Causes of the accident": "It is clear that the leaks were caused by a pressure increase and defective components. The reason why the quick-closing valves were shut off \u2013 which triggered the incident \u2013 remains unclear.",
        "Consequences": "- Pump destroyed,\n- Section of pipeline replaced Soil contamination, approximately 2 m3 of earth (disposed of).",
        "Emergency response": "The pipeline has a PN 16 pressure rating. Once pressure reaches 12 bar, the loading pump cuts out. Once pressure reaches 14 bar, the hydraulic accumulator (bladder accumulator) operates in order to compensate for ruptures, which is achieved by quickly closing valves. Neither of these safety devices activated. Both devices were inspected and found to be in full working order.\nThis suggests that the pressure was less than 12 bar. The maximum build-up of pressure which the pump can achieve is 9.6 bar. Normal operating pressure is 4-5 bar. Safety measures taken: plant fire service alerted, response carried out using full protection and independent breathing equipment, fluid covered with foam, removal (excavation) of contaminated earth under pipe leak, collection area pumped clear and cleaned. - Fluid contained,\n- Covered by foam - Defective pipeline replaced,\n- Pump will be replaced - Excavation,\n- Additional expert assessment carried out.",
        "Lesson Learned": "- Risk analysis (PAAG procedure) carried out for the affected area.\n- Bypass pumps removed and pipeline routing changed. Loading now done only using the ships\u2019 own pumps and no longer land-based pumps.\n- The loading pump is wired to the quick-closing valves.\n- Pipeline register has been drawn up and a systematic check is made of what inspection requirements must be met under the VAwS (Regulation on plants handling substances hazardous to water), BetrSichV (Industrial Safety Regulation) and St\u00f6rfallV (Hazardous Incident Regulation).\n- For three of the five pipelines which run out of the plant site an inspection requirement applies under the BetrSichV and VAwS. These three pipelines have now been inspected by an approved expert. The faults found have been rectified or are being dealt with."

        "Accident Description": "Description of the circumstances of the major accident: In the tunnel furnace of a brick yard, a natural gas explosion and subsequent fires occurred. The damages to the plant and to buildings are large. The preliminary investigation of the state criminal investigation agency could not identify the cause of the explosion. For this reason an expert agency was engaged. A clear cause could not be identified even through the experts, only a most probable cause could be determined. According to that, the explosion was caused by the release of gas from a ruptured hosepipe or a loose plug-in fitting. Hosepipes and plug-in fittings showed evidence of serious pre-existing damages. It can be assumed that either a porous hosepipe ruptured or that a plug in fitting got loose. As a report of the company proves, in particular the smaller and the older hoses were in a very bad condition. The internal rubber hose was porous and the external wire mesh in part defective. The same applied to the plug in fittings. The internal part of the plug in fittings was very dirty with a fatty grease, which in part was even encrusted (degraded component). This could have allowed a plug in fitting to get loose. The typology of the damages corresponds to the assumed cause of damage. It can be assumed that the explosion did occur in the firing chamber but instead in the intermediate roof (cooling channel). Furthermore, it is likely that the released gas was aspirated through the grid of the air intakes in the roof of the tunnel furnace and from there pulled backwards through the intermediate roof, were it mixed with air and formed thus the explosive mixture. The temperature in the cooling channel was of 127 degrees Celsius, which was not high enough for the ignition of the air/gas mixture. However the mixture could ignite in the range of the metal holders of the suspended roof or also be ignited by air pouring through leaks (cracks) in the suspended roof. The amount of released gas, the amount of the aspirated air and the degree of mixture could not be determined.",

At 02:55, there was a leak of phosgene, a toxic gas used as a raw material, within the pressure equipment containment chamber.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The leak occurred at the location of the connecting flange of a relief valve, upstream of the phosgenation reactor. The valve seal had been incorrectly reassembled after cleaning. A nitrogen leak test carried out prior to restart had not revealed any problems. Inspection showed that the graphite strip over 30&nbsp;mm of the circumference of the upstream seal was missing. The seal's external centering ring, caught in the threading of the bolting system, was found to have buckled slightly. This damage was caused by the seal being damaged when being fitted during reassembly. Checking had been inadequate. At the same time, the large door airlock seal had leaked because it was old and in frequent use, in particular in order to bring in equipment and material, as there was no dedicated airlock for these.",
        "Consequences": "Between 200 and 350&nbsp;kg of phosgene was emitted inside the chamber with less than 1&nbsp;kg escaping to the outside, without any effects on staff. The operator issued a press release and informed the administration. The facility was restarted the following day, once the leaks had been identified and dealt with. Damage and production losses amounted to several tens of thousands of euros.",
        "Emergency response": "The phosgene sensors installed in the containment chamber triggered an alarm. At 03:00, the installations were shut down and&nbsp; the chamber was isolated by ventilation valves being closed (automatic safety shutdown). At around 03:20, two external sensors detected a minor leak at the large door to the chamber (between 0.5 and 1 ppm). The phosgene dispersed throughout the chamber&nbsp; was sucked into the soda-ash packed tower scrubbers, which neutralised it by that evening.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The valve was changed and qualification-tested again. The main door bolts (20 of the 460 bolts were found to be loose) and the inflatable seals of the 2 related airlocks (dried out or corroded) were replaced. All the openings of the containment chamber were checked.\nThe operator made improvements to the formal procedure for testing equipment after cleaning: systematic acceptance of the work carried out by subcontractors, systematic helium leak testing of the valve.\nThe graphite seal technology was changed (from B29 to spiral type). Awareness and other training was organised for subcontractors (identification and tracking of seals). The chamber is to be pressure-tested every time the large door to the chamber is opened.&nbsp; The bolts were replaced with non-deformable bolts."

        "Accident Description": "It was noticed on 21 May 2009 that a PVC/glass-fibre reinforced\nhydrochloric acid pipeline which had been in operation for several years was\nstarting to leak. To avoid greater damage, this part of the plant was put out\nof service and replaced as a precaution with a PVC pipeline which, according to\nthe specification, was resistant to hydrochloric acid under the ambient\noperating conditions (temperature and pressure). On 28 May 2009 the shut-down of the desorption plant was started at\n10.00 as planned on account of decreasing loading. There was a leakage at around 10.10 of 32% hydrochloric acid from the\nby-pass line of a heat exchanger caused by a leaking pipe. The hydrochloric\nacid leaked into the plant's collection basin and was collected there. A\ndetector in the basin activated the alarm (on-the-spot, at the measuring\nstation and to on-site firefighters). Staff of the chlorosilane company were on\nthe spot immediately, the on-site firefighters arrived at 10.13. Once the location of the leak had been identified the feeder pump was\nstopped. The leakage stopped immediately. A total of approx. 7 m\u00b3 of\nhydrochloric acid 32% escaped. As the formation of acid clouds above the hydrochloric acid puddle had\nalready ceased, the emergency services (on-site firefighters) did not set up a\nwater screen to contain the clouds. At 10.20 the on-site firefighters left. The hydrochloric clouds formed from the acid drifted eastwards (Rhine)\nwithin several minutes. There was a westerly wind of around 3 m/s at the time\nof the incident. It is believed that in the middle of the Rhine the cloud was drawn by\nthe movement of the water away from the direction of the wind and towards a\npower station building site in the Rhine. At around 10.30 the head of operations was informed that construction\nworkers on the power station building site in the Rhine were complaining of\nirritation of the respiratory tract. Six staff received initial assistance from\nthe medical services on site. Those\ninjured were then taken to nearby hospitals for observation at around 13.00.\nFour of the staff were released by the hospital that evening after out-patient\ntreatment. Two remained in the clinic overnight for observation.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A hydrochloric acid pipeline made of glass-fibre reinforced PVC which\nhad been in use for several years was beginning to leak and was therefore\nreplaced by the plant's maintenance division to prevent a more serious\naccident.\nHowever, the replacement pipeline was made of PVC without glass-fibre\nreinforcement. When this change was being made to the plant it was simply\nensured that the replacement pipeline was resistant to hydrochloric acid. The\npipeline failed seven days after being put into service.

        "Accident Description": "Fire on the floating roof of a tank containing virgin naphtha, after the naphtha had spilt out onto the floating roof and as the emptying of the tank was starting. The fire, which broke out at 00.50 on 27 September 2014, developed like a pool fire, i.e. like a fire in a pool of fuel, and was therefore confined to the area of the tank roof that was in contact with the fuel. In the safety report, an accident of this kind was considered to be possible. The fire continued throughout the night and was extinguished at about 10.30 on 27 September 2014.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Malfunctioning of the floating roof, which failed to ensure the required leakproofness, thus allowing the substance to spill out onto the roof. It is not known what caused the virgin naphtha vapours to rise even though the control procedures had been activated.\n&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "The accident resulted in damage to the plant as it involved TK&nbsp;513, the virgin naphtha it contained, the ducts connecting other equipment in the accident area to the tank, as well as the tank's containment and extinguisher systems.As the fire was a pool fire, the fuel&nbsp; was contained wholly within the area of the roof and thus burned solely on the floating caissons, the fire being confined within the internal walls of TK&nbsp;513. There were no spills or leakages into the containment basin, and no fire outbreak was recorded there.The company&rsquo;s statements and the measurements and inspections carried out by the local Environmental Protection Agency branch indicate that there was no immediate damage to the environment or to persons. The air quality monitoring units did not record significant variations in the pollutant concentrations measured.&nbsp; This accident resulted in over EUR&nbsp;2&nbsp;million worth of material damage within the plant. The material damage was inspected within the refinery and was due to:&nbsp; - the loss of 6&nbsp;000 tonnes (company estimate) of virgin naphtha in the tank, - the total destruction of floating-roof tank TK&nbsp;513, - damage to the tank&rsquo;s containment and extinguishing systems and to connecting pipes, - damage to one of the company&rsquo;s own firefighting appliances,&nbsp; - the clean-up and refurbishment of connecting devices, - the costs to be incurred in rebuilding the tank. According to the company, the consequences of the accident in terms of cost amount to about EUR&nbsp;14&nbsp;290&nbsp;000.00, including: - approx. EUR&nbsp;4&nbsp;500&nbsp;000.00 for the 6&nbsp;000 tonnes of virgin naphtha that burned;&nbsp; - approx. EUR&nbsp;9&nbsp;790&nbsp;000.00 for the decommissioning and subsequent rebuilding of TK&nbsp;513.During the fire, fire brigade and refinery staff attended to the tank and the tanks close to it, and these were monitored by checking the critical temperatures of the materials. Therefore, the tank did not collapse and spill its contents into the containment basin, but it buckled on one side at about 10&nbsp;m, of the initial 19&nbsp;m, from the base.The tank-roof fire developed despite the measures taken, but the accident did not affect other installations or persons. It is clear that, although functioning, the fixed and mobile firefighting systems used during the accident did not enable the emergency services to keep the fire under control and/or to extinguish the fire immediately after its outbreak.The Prefecture did not consider it necessary to put the external action plan (EEP) into action.",
        "Emergency response": "From 13.50 on 25 September 2014, the tank was being filled.\nAt about 9.30 on 26 September 2014, during a patrol they were making owing to the presence of odours, the operations staff detected the presence of virgin naphtha in a limited area of the tank roof. Checks were made immediately and showed that the product was escaping because the western side of the roof was starting to sink as it was taking in liquid from the pontoon sections on the same side.The filling of the tank was interrupted at about 9.40 on 26 September 2014.At about 10.30 on 26 September 2014, the refinery\u2019s management decided to empty the tank as per the operating manual, in addition to implementing all the necessary preventive measures to ensure safety, namely: continuous attendance of firefighting vehicles; preventive covering of the product on the roof with a foam extinguisher; presence, in continuous shifts, of firefighting and technical operations teams for the emptying operation.The layer of extinguisher was applied to the product on the roof at about 10.45 on 26 September 2014.The operations staff started emptying TK&nbsp;513 at about 12.20 on 26 September 2014.In the hours that followed, the transfer of the product continued, whilst the layer of extinguishing foam was maintained by means of successive top-ups that were needed both to cover the product on the roof and owing to increased wind intensity.At about 0.45 on 27 September 2014, the fuel was found to have started leaking and then the fire to have broken out on the tank roof. The level of the tank was estimated to be about 5.5&nbsp;m (it had not been possible to gauge the level for several hours), corresponding to a volume of virgin naphtha of about 30&nbsp;000 m3. The internal emergency plan was put into action. The municipal and provincial fire brigades were notified.The tank\u2019s fire protection (cooling and foam spraying) systems were activated immediately. The cooling systems of three adjacent tanks were turned on. The cooling systems of two tanks located further to the south, beyond the embankment of a former railway, were later also turned on. It was possible to keep tank shell temperatures under control with the aid of a thermal sensor. Firefighting equipment and perimeter hydrants were used to protect the lines of transfer of the product in TK&nbsp;513 from irradiance (north side), as was the rack to the south of the tank so as to prevent fire spreading to the vegetation on the trackbed of the former railway.The fire brigade arrived on the scene. At about 2.00 on 27 September 2014, transfer of the product in TK513, interrupted when the emergency arose, was resumed in order to minimise the quantity of product burned.At about 10.00 on 27 September 2014, the most intense phase of the fire seemed to have ended; there were far fewer flames but there was still some smoke activity. The tank's firefighting systems were found to be still active. The on-site and external firefighting teams remained in attendance and monitored the situation.The end of the emergency was declared at about 17.30 on 27 September 2014.On 28 September 2014, the situation was stable, with just one spot fire in the south side of the tank. In the meantime, the cooling of the tank shell, using the cooling ring and monitors, and the removal of the product both continued, although the pump was activated discontinuously by the operator.Traces of smoke could still be detected in the air.From 04.00 to 09.00 on 29 September 2014 there was a resurgence of smoke due to a number of residual spot fires.There was another resurgence of smoke at approx. 9.00-14.00 on 30 September 2014, again due to a number of residual spot fires.&nbsp;In response to this, action is being taken, together with the provincial fire brigade HQ, to put in place fixed foam spraying systems with mounted monitors (including two high-power (7&nbsp;000 and 10&nbsp;000 lt/min) systems) in order to extinguish residual spot fires more quickly.It was then decided to revert to cooling the shell and draining the tank.At about 23.00 on 3 October, all the spot fires had been extinguished.The company stated that the internal emergency plan (IEP) had been put into action immediately and had dealt with the emergency. As decided by the Prefecture, the external emergency plan (EEP) was not put into action.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The refinery\u2019s February 2015 analysis of the incident highlighted the need to reassess the frequency of potential accidents arising in the storage tank area when updating the safety report.Following the accident, the control authority has imposed the following measures on the plant operator:- installation of suitable detection systems capable of promptly alerting the control room to tank roof anomalies (installation on all floating-roof atmospheric tanks of a floating roof monitoring system capable of assessing the slope of the roof),- checks on roofs, caissons, ladders and tank drainage systems,- development of a special monitoring plan for floating-roof tanks with reference to standard API 653, check list appendix C- regular planning of dimensional measurements,- revision of the procedure for inspecting and maintaining tanks for hydrocarbon products"

This accident is notified because two persons were intoxicated in Germany, on of was hospitalised more than three days.The accident is classified at level 2 of the of the accident gravity scale made official in February 1994 by the committee of competent authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive (level two due to the intoxication of 5 persons and level 2 for the economic loss caused by the accident).",
        "Causes of the accident": "At 19:50 a black out in the electrical network released the onsite emergency plan in the different production workshops. The units were shut down at 20:15. In such circumstances, it is foreseen that the workshops transfer the products under process to the two flare units of the site. The diesel emergency generator sets foreseen to Take relief in case of black out did not power up fast enough to assure the cooling of the reactors of line 1 and 2 during the shut down phase of the workshop.",
        "Consequences": "A large smoke cloud formed due to the combustion of the discharged products in the flare system and dispersed in the atmosphere during exceptional meteorological conditions with rainstorms.The meteorological conditions were adverse (low wind speed), the styrene cloud affected 3 neighbours of the municipality of Hopital (France) and 2 neighbours of the municipality of Leuterbach (Germanz), including a child hospitalised during 3 days.Between 7 and 9 p.m., sensors close to the petrochemical plant recorded high concentrations of dust, SO2 (585 \u00b5g/m# over a quarter hour) and orthoxylene (535 \u00b5g/m# over a quarter hour) probably due to styrene (compatible chemical characteristics). The high SO2 readings may be due to units on the site, as well as to the coke plant supplying the nearby power station. This is because a condensation separator on the coke plant's gas line self-ignited at about 4 p.m. The electricity supply shut-down resulted in production losses of 0.5 to 2 million euros.",
        "Emergency response": "The onsite emergency plan was activated. The emergency response services took rapidly control of the situation.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In compliance with the urgent prefectural decree issued 06/07/05 - a report on&nbsp; the failure cause of the emergency generator sets was submitted,&nbsp; - the start-up sequential of the generator sets was modified- the risk assessment&nbsp; and the Onsite&nbsp; Emergency Plan were completedThis measures have allowed the operator to start up the polymer plant again. DRIRE has proposed to issue an additional prefectrural decree imposing the operator to review all emergency generator sets present on the petrochemical installation and to perform a study identifying all potential release points of hazardous substances in the installation including the nature of the substances and the quantities potentially released.

        "Accident Description": "On 23 October 2011, at about 21.00, a fire occurred at a plant used for the polymerisation of alpha-Methylstyrene (AMS) with acrylonitrile (ACN) with the help of the radical initiator azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), following a deflagration when pouring the radical initiator AIBN into a preparation tank with AMS.\nEmergency services were activated, the fire was extinguished by the on-site fire service, and all of the facility\u2019s systems were shut down by 22.40. One worker suffered serious burns during the incident. The fire caused extensive damage to the facility, in particular to the electrical cables and data communication. According to statements made by the plant manager, material damage amounted to about \u20ac3 million to \u20ac4 million. The investigation found that the incident was caused by unforeseen excess pressure in a preparation tank for a radical initiator.\nDuring a filling procedure, AIBN was released in the form of a dust cloud, which then ignited, injuring the employee working in the area. A second deflagration occurred when three open AIBN drums, which were near the reactor, ignited. This second deflagration was stronger than the first, and caused the extensive damage to cables and an electrical room. When the process control system activated the alarm, the system was shut down to put it in a safe condition. All input of material ceased, and the remaining reaction heat in the reactor was removed as quickly as possible using water in the cooling circuit.\nWithin about 30 minutes the remaining initiator was used up, polymerisation stopped and the reactor cooled to room temperature. Sequence of events:\n19 October 2011\nFollowing a stoppage, the reactor was put back into operation and approximately 400 litres of AMS/ACN solution was poured in to seal the output pumps. Various problems with the ACN intake valves, as well other system valves, led to operation being suspended so that the intake system could be examined.\nIt was subsequently established that the problems were caused by a faulty software update to the DCS system. As a result, the software update was repeated without further problems. The software error itself is not considered to be the cause or a contributing aspect of the incident. 23 October 2011\n13.30: For the current production in the reactor, a new starting solution was created; the system was working normally, with no signs of any anomalies. 20.13: The shift workers determined that the reactor (due to the above problem of the inoperative intake system) was showing a pressure of 3 bars. A manual valve was opened to release pressure from the tank into the emergency release tank.\nThe shift workers were not aware, nor could they have noticed, that releasing pressure from the reactor led to a pressure build-up in the emergency release tank.\nA subsequent calculation of the pressure patterns showed that the decrease in pressure in the reactor from 3 bars at 20.14 to 2.1 bars at 21.03 led to an increase in pressure in the emergency release tank from 1 bar to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.25: The growing pressure in the emergency release tank reached 1.2 bars, causing the white oil contained in the immersion tank to be pushed into the preparation tank.\nThis assumption was confirmed by analyses of the contents of the preparation tank after the incident, which revealed the presence of white oil. Furthermore, in the gas phase of the preparation tank, organic compounds (acrylonitrile) were detected. This shows that the gas phases of the emergency release tank and of the preparation tank were connected and at the same pressure level at this time. The pressure in this combined system continued to grow to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.30: A worker left the measuring station to prepare the next batch of AIBN starting solution to be added to the preparation tank. He removed four drums of AIBN from storage and placed them on a trolley, removed all four lids and placed the first drum in the drum tipper. This was normal procedure. Approx. 20.50: The first drum was swung over the preparation tank and the slide valve on the tank was opened. As the second slide valve opened, a dust cloud issued from the funnel of the drum tipper, ignited and injured the worker, who at that point was standing at the drum tipper\u2019s control panel. A reconstruction of this situation shows that, when the second slide valve on the drum was opened, the excess pressure of 1.7 bars in the preparation tank lifted the drum out of the funnel by at least a few centimetres. The excess pressure blew the powdered AIBN out of the drum and into the surrounding area, leading to a dust cloud, which subsequently ignited. This ignition could have happened one of two ways:\na) A brush discharge onto metal parts can lead to ignition of the mixture of AIBN powder and the gas phase containing organic components, or\nb) Ignition caused by brush discharge onto the inner lining of the drum.\nBoth possibilities could arise from the drum being lifted up by the excess pressure and the resulting gap between the drum and the funnel, if a highly charged dust cloud with a high gas velocity issues from the gap. 21.03: The shift workers at the measuring station heard an explosion and saw multiple gas detector alerts on their screens. In front of the measuring station, they found the injured worker, who was wet from the emergency shower when he came into the measuring station. They noticed a large fire in the area of the drum tipper and immediately alerted the fire service and the emergency doctor.\nBecause of the fire and the damage done to the cables, most of the DCS information was cut off.\nThe investigation after the incident showed that the injured worker had most likely opened all four drums and left the lids on a shelf on the wall.\nThe drum, which had been swung over the preparation tank, exhibited a large hole and was empty, and the metal rings of the other drums were found near the trolley that had been used to transport the drums from storage to the drum tipper. It is clear that, a couple of minutes after the first fire occurred, the fire caused by the dust cloud had ignited the other three drums (this was the explosion heard by the shift workers) and the cables on the wall behind the drums. 21.11: The on-site fire service fought the fire; all other persons evacuated the building.\nThe cables on the wall bracket led to the central electrical room, behind the wall and one floor up. Some of the cables passed through the wall through sand traps, which were fire resistant, while others led to the electrical room through Hauff cable ducts with insufficient fire resistance. 21.36: Fire under control, worker on way to specialist clinic. 22.40: Fire extinguished, although the on-site fire service posted a fire watch until the next morning.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "System error / management error 1. Creation of the AIBN dust cloud with subsequent ignition:\nWhen relieving the pressure in the reactor by opening the manual valve, the shift workers were not aware that that could overload the gas system of the emergency release tank. The occurrence of excess pressure in the preparation tank caused by opening a manual valve had not been taken into account in safety discussions, only excess pressure caused by the activation of safety valves had been considered; however, this should have become apparent due to the abnormal conditions in the polymerisation reactors.\nThis approach was also supported by technology experts. This problem was made worse by a process modification in 2008, when the exhaust gas line of the preparation tank was attached to the emergency release tank, i.e. before the perforated disk in the exhaust system leading to the vent pipe. In addition, the pressure indicators on the preparation tank were installed such that the shift worker could not see them when operating the drum tipper.\nA HAZOP study was carried out on the polymerisation process; however, the preparation tank for the initiator was not taken into consideration, as it was not seen to entail a risk (due in part to the conclusion that excess pressure would be noticeable due to a disturbance in the polymerisation tank).\nThe recommendation was made to carry out a HAZOP study on the AIBN system when it is put back into operation. 2. Second deflagration and the larger fire with resulting damage to cables and electrical room:\nBecause all four AIBN drums were positioned and opened near the drum tipper, the first fire caused by the dust igniting was able to ignite a larger amount of flammable material, and the fire therefore became significantly bigger. Furthermore, the cable fire reached the electrical room through the Hauff cable ducts. The damage to the cables and in the electrical room meant that the facility was completely out of operation for longer.\nThe decision to include the Hauff system in the factory standard, with reference to the on-site fire service, should be re-examined in light of this incident. 3. The seriousness of the shift worker\u2019s burns:\nThe worker was wearing normal work clothing which was seen as appropriate to the activities.\nIn light of this incident and the seriousness of the injuries he suffered because of it, the protective equipment for this activity and for the site must undergo a full review.\n",
        "Consequences": "Severe damage to switch rooms for certain plant components, as well as smoke and water damage.\nMaterial damage: \u20ac3 000 000",
        "Emergency response": "The building was disconnected from the mains to prevent spark discharges while the fire was being extinguished. Blackened areas cleaned (only with protective clothing and air filtering).\nCeiling covering replaced, cleaning of all affected areas, temporary foil sealing of damaged window openings. All power lines checked before resuming activity.

        "Finish Date": "2011-04-02 13:15:00",
        "Accident Description": "On 2&nbsp;April 2011, between 11.29 and 13.15, there was an emission of ammonia from the high-pressure section of a urea plant. In total, approximately 25&nbsp;000&nbsp;kg of ammonia was released into the atmosphere.  The incident was caused by a leak from an inlet pipe in the high-pressure system. This pipe is part of the high-pressure section of the urea plant, but no urea flows through it when the system is operating normally (dead branch).  The incident was caused by a corrosion mechanism which, due to the prevailing temperature gradient, led to an unexpectedly high degree of abrasion. It should be noted here that, in the context of work carried out while the system was out of operation in 2010, the main pipe was pressure-tested with 1.3 times the system pressure and the wall thickness was measured, with no abnormalities being detected in either case.  The system was isolated and the pressure reduced using valves and water walls were created by the on-site fire service to precipitate the ammonia. At the time of the incident weather conditions were sunny and stable with wind speeds of 3&nbsp;m/s.  There was no harm to any persons or the environment as a result of the incident. A public road was closed to traffic as a precaution. During the incident and until approximately 3 hours after the emission had ended, environmental measurements were taken as a precaution, both on and off site.  Safety measure: - Pressure reduced via a safety valve vent - Water walls created by fire service",
        "Causes of the accident": "See Accident Description.",
        "Consequences": "Defective pipe",
        "Emergency response": "- Environmental measurements\n- Access roads closed ",
        "Lesson Learned": "To avoid similar incidents, similar parts (dead branches) of the urea plant were identified and inspected; this check did not indicate any corrosion.   The defective pipe was replaced and inspected after three, six, nine and twelve months, with no abnormalities being detected.  Inspections must currently be carried out every twelve months on the section of pipe concerned. The inspection results show that the material used in the past is suitable for use in the high-pressure section of urea plants. Nevertheless, the use of higher-quality, i.e. more corrosion-resistant, material is planned when critical pipes are replaced.  Furthermore, an additional risk-based inspection programme (RBI) is used to more effectively monitor parts of the process plants that are critical to the system.  Introduction of improved communication channels both internally and externally."

        "Accident Description": "The emergency services were alerted when a chemical reaction occurred in an intermediate bulk container (IBC) which contained bulk-emulsion explosive waste. When the rescue operation got underway, it was assumed that the container could go on fire or explode. The situation was hazardous because the container was stacked together with about 200 other waste containers\u00a0(about 100 tonnes waste) at a distance of approximately five metres from an explosives warehouse (about 40 tonnes of explosive substances). At that precise moment, the major risk was seen to be an explosion, whose pressure effects could extend to a radius of about 1300 metres from the warehouse.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The sensitized bulk-emulsion explosive and rock material, containing pyrite, reacted together in a steamed waste container which was situated next to the explosives warehouse. The container was originally from the Pyh\u00e4salmi mine, where exactly one year earlier an attempt to load the blast holes in the roof of the tunnel with emulsion explosives by means of a new mobile explosive manufacturing unit (MEMU) failed. As a result of this, a significant amount of sensitized emulsion dropped onto the floor of the tunnel. The miners did not realize that the mixture of sensitized emulsion explosive and rock material was a non-conformity waste. Accordingly, the waste was handled as typical emulsion waste and was sent to Vihtavuori. The production volumes of bulk-emulsion explosives in Oy Forcit Ab have multiplied over the past few years because of increasing mining and infrastructure development. At the same time, bulk-emulsion explosives are being increasingly used instead of traditional explosives. Oy Forcit Ab has not been able to keep pace with the disposal of the emulsion waste. The emulsion waste occurs during both the production phase and the application phase. Emulsion waste containers have been stored mainly in the yard of the explosives factory and in the yard of the explosives warehouse. Tukes has requested that Forcit takes corrective actions to resolve the waste-container warehousing problem. Forcit has taken several corrective actions, but these actions have been inadequate due to the simultaneous increase in production volumes. The Explosives Act that is currently in force covers the production, use and disposal of traditional explosives. The special properties and risks connected with the production, use and disposal of emulsion explosives have not adequately been taken into account in these legal requirements. ",
        "Consequences": "Major accident didn't occur. Major risk was seen to be an explosion, whose pressure effects could extend to a radius of about 1300 metres from the warehouse. Evacuation of the surrounding area, about 2000 inhibitants.Shut down of production unit for two weeks.",
        "Emergency response": "The implementation of rescue operation was\u00a0complicated\u00a0due to\u00a0the following facts:\u00a0- The operator didn't have the permit from authority for waste\u00a0containers (permit was only for explosives warehouse)- Waste containers weren't taken into account in the risk analysis\u00a0or emergency plans. Thus the accident scenarios were needed to recalculate in the event. The rescue services decided to evacuate all the inhabitants in the area before they attempted to move the container and cool down the interior. To safeguard all the inhabitants, the evacuation was extended to cover the whole Vihtavuori village, which has about 2000 inhabitants. After a successful rescue operation, the evacuation was completed during the same evening.",
        "Lesson Learned": "1. All parties need to ensure that they have adequate processes and procedures in place related to the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of emulsion explosives. They also need to ensure that these methods are properly implemented. 2. In major hazard installations everyone is responsible for safety and following instructions. Managers need to ensure that regulatory requirements are met and corrective actions are adequate.3. In particular, it is essential to observe how changes in performance affect safety. Safety-critical changes may include a significant and rapid increase in production volumes, the use of new technology or new kinds of products, or changes relating to organisational structures and responsibilities, or supply chains. There is a need to organise training for personnel and to improve instructions to better identify and manage the effect of these changes on safety.4. In addition, there is a need to organise training for personnel and improve instructions related to the identification and handling of safety-critical non-conformities.5. The major accident scenarios presented in safety reports should be more systematically communicated when preparing internal and external emergency plans. In addition, training for those scenarios should be comprehensive.6. A complete reform of the Explosives Act is called for. To this end, the requirements should be updated to take account of the specific properties and risks connected with emulsion explosives."

        "Accident Description": "At 14:53 on 5 June 2016 there was a brief (360 ms) voltage fluctuation on the 20 KV power supply (in two phases) of the operating area.This was caused by a lightning strike on the electricity supplier\u2019s 110 kV line. This led, amongst other things, to the failure of the cooling brine pumps and the HF cooling machines. The duty electrician was sent for immediately afterwards. The lack of cooling and the pressure build-up in the whole system led to a visible emission of CaSO4/H2SO4/HF from the two rotary kilns a few minutes later.This was stopped by opening the emergency extraction system immediately. Due to the lack of cooling capacity, the liquid HF evaporated in the condensers. The resulting large quantity of gas was drawn into the kilns as a result of the emergency extraction and then escaped at the kilns\u2019 sealing points. The raw materials feed was then shut off. In parallel, the brine pump was manually started, but in spite of the electrical starting pulse being given, this pump did not start. The cooling machines were then able to be started with the help of the electrician. At that time (15:30), emissions were already starting to fall due to the feed of raw materials being halted.As the brine pump was not running, the cooling machines failed again due to unused cooling capacity. At that time it was noticed that the brine pump was not running; this was then successfully started. The emissions were then stopped (15:36).At 15:40 the site squad, who had been called, arrived, followed at 15:55 by the site fire brigade. By then, there were no more emissions. It was no longer necessary to put a water curtain in place.\nSafety measure:Shut down the HF production facilities after the cooling machines and coolant pumps could not be started immediately.",

        "Causes of the accident": "Analysis of the accident shows that the first explosion was linked to the generation of an electric arc on the furnace\u2019s stinger. This arcing for 29 seconds pierced the stinger cooling water circuit. The water poured into the furnace and evaporated on contact with the metal, producing hydrogen. The pressure in the furnace rose. The steam and hydrogen were evacuated through the valve from the furnace\u2019s air pumping circuit, but the pressure continued to rise. The portholes of the furnace give way in turn. When the water circuit was shut off by the foundry worker, the pressure decreased and air entered the furnace. The mixture of hydrogen and air became explosive, resulting in the first explosion and the destruction of the furnace casing and crucible cooling circuit. The crucible cooling water poured onto the molten metal on the ground, generating steam and hydrogen. Mixed with air, the hydrogen caused the second, more violent explosion. The secondary arcing could have been the result of a problem of geometry, surface condition and/or quality of the fitting of the parts (stinger, stub and tip).

        "Finish Date": "2005-10-28 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SituationThe storage terminal contains 7 storage tanks in one large bund. The bund is made of earth. The terminal is situated at some distance from the refinery it is connected with.-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 large crude oil tanks of which 3 are situated in a row and a fourth crude oil tank is situated before the second tank. These storage tanks are identified as D1, D2, D3 and D4;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 smaller slop oil tanks, D10 and D11;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a very small crude oil tank D26.The crude oil tanks D1, D2, D3 and D4 have a capacity of 40 000 m3 and the slop oil tanks D10 and D11 have a capacity of 24 000 m3.The crude oil is delivered by pipeline and is pumped by pipeline to the Refinery.On September 12th, 2005 a minor incident occurred at the storage tank D3. During this incident an amount of 35 m3 crude oil leaked from the bottom of the tank. The exact cause of this incident is not yet known. At the moment the major accident occurred with tank D2 cleaning operations for storage tank D3 were just started in order to inspect storage tank D3 and to determine the causes of the incident of September 12th.At the moment the major accident happened the slop oil tank D10 was full, the slop oil tank D11 was empty, the crude oil tank D4 was partially full, the crude oil tank D2 was for 75% full en the tanks D1, D3 en D26 were empty and in revision.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chronological description of the accident and the interventionOn October 25, 2005 around 18.15h a major leak at tank D2 was detected. Storage tank D2 contained at that moment almost 33 000 m3 crude oil. Information from the DCS-system situated in the off-sites control room of the refinery indicates that the full inventory of storage tank D2 was released within 10 minutes. Because the contents of the storage tank was released in such a short time, an enormous wave appeared. Due to the amount of crude that was released, the bund was filled ( 40 000 m2 large) with crude up to&nbsp; a height of 1 m. Due to the effect of the crude wave, a small amount of 3 m3 of crude was ejected out of the bund into a nearby creek.After the release the storage tank was leaning forward. It also seamed that the storage tank was sledded of his foundation, although it is not clear if this was a cause or rather a consequence of the incident. Initially the fire brigade started to cover the bund with fire fighting foam to avoid ignition of the crude oil and to reduce the smell. Directly a large amount of fire fighting foam was donated by the Refinery, other (petro)chemical companies and the fire brigade to cover the very large bund area with foam.&nbsp; Due to the very strong wind that evening and the use of different types of fire fighting foam they did not succeeded to cover the whole bund with foam. Especially the inner part of the large bund (where al the piping and valves are situated) stayed even after several hours uncovered. On the other hand the strong wind had the advantage that no explosive atmosphere was formed above the spill.The contents of the slop oil tank D10 and the crude oil tank D4 was immediatly pumped to storage tanks situated at the refinery itself. The contents of the bund is firstly pumped to the slop oil tank D11. In order to fill the slop oil tank D10 and de crude oil tank D4 with the product in the bund, some manual valves had to be handled. Because of the presence of piping, valves and walking platforms in the bund, is was not possible to reach the valves by boat. Therefore two operators (fully protected with chemical overalls and breathing apparatus) have walked through the crude and manipulated the valves.During the next two days the mixture of crude oil, fire fighting foam and water was pumped to the storage tanks D10 and D4. This was done at a velocity of 900 m3 an hour. Afterwards a part of this mixture was send to storage tanks at the refinery. In the afternoon of October 27th , 2005 the bund was mostly empty, except of some smaller pools of crude oil. These pools were removed by vacuum cleaning trucks.On October 28th, 2005 the intervention was finished and the cleaning up of the terminal could start. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommentsThe storage tank D2 was built in 1970. At that moment the storage terminal belonged to XX. It was sold in 1990 to the Refinery. At that moment all the tanks were inspected and repaired if necessary. This was also the case for storage tank D2. The inspection before the tank D2 was used again was done in 1991. From 1994 until now each 3 years an external inspection was performed. These inspections showed almost no remarks. Next year a total revision of the storage tank was planned. Every three years setting measurements of the storage tanks were carried out. The last measurements were done in 2004. These measurements showed no anomalies.At this moment the cause of this major accident is not yet know. There are some indications that a subsidence (movement of the soil) could have caused this accident, because one month before this accident the crude oil tank D3 also had a leak. More investigation on both tanks is necessary to know if both accidents are related with each other.Two days after the accident, the bund was nearly empty. At that moment it was clearly visible that a part of the foundation of storage tank D2 had disappeared. Parts of the foundation were found in the bund over a distance of 20 to 30 m. An important concern after the accident is the stability of all storage tanks at the storage terminal at the left bank. For the moment each day setting measurements are performed. To reduce the risk of another release, most part of the contents of the storage tanks D4, D10 and D11 are pumped to the refinery where it was shipped to Rotterdam. Afterwards these tanks were partially filled with water in order to let the roof float.For the moment the terminal only contains sludge. This sludge is present in the storage tanks D4, D10, D11 and D2.After the accident the company organized already 8 inspections with the authorities in order to discuss al measures they are taking concerning safety and environment. Also a public hearing for the neighbourhood was organized.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean-up operationsThe Refinery has set up a project group in order to make the terminal safe and start the cleaning of the terminal.In order to reduce the smell in the neighbourhood. The bund area is covered with sand, except the zone in front of the storage tank D2. Because the tank is leaning forward, it was not safe to enter the bund and in that area a lot of sludge was still present. This sludge containing a lot of sand is very viscous and has an average depth of 1 m.From November 6th, 2005 the storage tank D2 is stabilized by 4 mayor cranes. These cranes that can support the total mass of the storage tank are placed on a service way just outside the bund.After the stabilisation of the storage tank D2, two manholes of the storage tank were opened. Measurements indicated that the atmosphere in the storage tank was not explosive. They also saw that the floating roof had properly landed on his supports (legs). Nevertheless the company does not want operators to enter the storage tank to remove the sludge. For that reason they have ordered a robot to suck the sludge out of the storage tank.In the next week a profound investigation of the soil will start. Firstly drillings until a depth of 2 to 3 m will be performed to measure the soil contamination. Afterwards drilling until a depth of 25 to 30 m will be performed to measure the stability of the soil at the terminal and in the surroundings.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A circumferential fissure in the bottom plate has been observed after cleaning.\nThis fissure has a length of about 10 m and is situated at about 2 m from the tank wall.\n\nSamples of the bottom plate have been taken for further investigation.",

        "Lesson Learned": "6.1. Detection of the problemJust as for each process equipment with risks for major accidents, the phenomena which can lead to a degradation of the containment, in this case the storage tank, should be identified and analysed.This accident indicates the possible risks as a consequence of the presence of non mixable phases which can settle out. An investigation of the possible presence of such phases should form a part of the identification of possible corrosive phenomena. If necessary chemical analyses should be performed to determine the corrosive behaviour of these phases (chemical composition, pH,#).This incident further shows that in the bottom of storage tanks gutters can be formed. In those gutters corrosive products can accumulate, what can result in local, uniform corrosion. In the case water and/or other corrosive products can induce corrosion of the tank bottom, it should be investigated if there is also a problem of gutter forming in the bottom.Gutter forming in the bottom of storage tanks is induced by a combination of the size of the storage tank, the local compressibility of the foundation and a relative elastic underground. The gutters are not always visible by the eye. They can be mapped by performing a topographic investigation. The topographic maps are achieved by a surveyor who measures the bottom of the storage tank with a laser.The local uniform corrosion which is a consequence of the gutter forming is not easily detected. The local reduction of the thickness of the bottom plate can be overlooked if ultrasonic thickness measurements are only performed on a cross banded pattern. If the risk of local corrosion due to gutter forming in the bottom exists, suitable techniques should be used to investigate the bottom plates. These techniques are described below.6.2. Possible solutionsIf local, uniform corrosion induced by gutter forming is a problem, the company should take suitable measures to avoid a loss of containment as a consequence of the corrosion. In the next paragraph some different possible measures are listed according to the place they take in the prevention hierarchy. In function of the specific situation it can be necessary to take multiple measures, if necessary completed with additional measures which are not described here.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoiding or limiting the presence of corrosive products that can settle out.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid that products settle out (mixing the different phases)Mixing of the products in the storage tank can avoid or limit that insoluble phases settle out. To achieve good results the effectiveness of the mixing is important.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removing of settled out productsIt has to be assured by a procedure that settled out products are periodically removed. But note that the draining of settled out products does not guarantee that settlements are removed out of gutters in the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoiding the formation of gutters in the bottomExisting storage tanks can be lifted up and the foundation underneath can be restored. In this case it must be kept in mind that by performing a hydrostatic test it is possible that new settlements can take place. For existing tanks there is also the possibility to analyse the foundation and the underground under the storage tanks in order to gather enough information to perform calculations. These calculations can indicate if the risk of gutter forming exists or not. For new storage tanks a detailed calculations of the foundations can be performed during the design phase to reduce the risk of gutter formation.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LiningA lining is applied on the tank bottom and the first shell course. A lining which is well attached will largely reduce the corrosion velocity. A badly adjusted lining will still reduce the uniform corrosion but will promote pitting corrosion underneath the lining. A good attachment of a lining depends on a lot of parameters such as moisture, temperature, kind of lining, not stepping on a not fully hardened layer,#.&nbsp; To achieve guarantee about the thickness of the lining and the attachment of the lining it is necessary to perform measurements on the thickness of the different layers, to perform a conductivity test and to perform a non porosity test. The code API 652 \"Linings of aboveground petroleum storage tank bottoms\" describes the advantages and disadvantages of different kind of linings.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning of internal inspections based on the corrosion velocityThe intervals between internal inspections have to be defined based on the estimated corrosion velocity. This is a general principle that can be found in de API 653 standard \"Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration and Reconstruction\". Normally the corrosion velocity of the bottom plates is the most important one. In the case of major local corrosion, it will be this higher, local corrosion velocity which is determinative for the inspection interval.The internal corrosion velocity can be determined by analysing the settled out products. Based on graphics which indicate the overall corrosion velocity of the construction material as a function of the corrosive character of these residues (e.g. pH-measurement), the corrosion velocity can be estimated. Based on the corrosion velocity it can be determined how long the storage tank can be safely used before a next internal inspection is necessary. API 653 describes what minimum plate thicknesses have to be measured to use a storage tank safely. If it is expected that large differences can occur in the chemical composition and the properties of the residues, these analyses and the calculation of the inspection interval must be periodically repeated. The analysis of the bottom products can be used to trace other corrosion phenomena (e.g. bacteriological corrosion).&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adapted internal inspection techniquesInternal inspections in which case ultrasonic thickness measurements are only performed in a cross banded pattern (just to achieve a general impression of the thickness of the bottom of the storage tank) are not sufficient to trace local, uniform corrosion.In order to achieve an entire image of all changes in the thickness of the bottom of a storage tank the bottom must be totally scanned. Floor scans are very useful to measure sudden volume changes in the floor (e.g. pitting corrosion). They can however also be used to trace gradual changes in the thickness of the bottom plates. To guarantee that a floor scan generates accurate information on the state of the entire bottom of the storage tank, certain conditions have to be satisfied.It must be checked if the presence of a lining has an influence on the results of the floor scan.Before the inspection is must be clearly discussed with the performers in which state the storage tank must be presented to achieve good measurements. In some cases the entire bottom of the storage tank must be sand blasted before measurements can be performed. In this case it is necessary to discuss the criteria for the sand blasting in advance. It is also favourable that the contractor who will perform the floor scan inspects the cleaning conditions of the bottom plates.The signal that is generated by the floor scanning apparatus can suffer from drift. This phenomenon is not necessarily a problem if the floor scanning is used to detect pitting corrosion. The moment pitting corrosion is detected, the signal changes so much that even with some drift on the signal, the pitting corrosion is detected. The drift on the electric signal has however a much larger impact when floor scanning is used to detect gradual changes in the bottom floor. To solve this problem it is useful to perform a few ultrasonic thickness measurements on each bottom plate. The signal from the floor scanning apparatus can be gauged for each bottom plate in order to achieve accurate measurements on gradual changes in the bottom thickness.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional external inspection techniquesIn addition to the above described internal inspections, intermediate external inspections can be performed in order to gather additional information on the corrosion status of the storage tanks. These inspection techniques, which can be applied when the storage tanks are in duty, are especially useful when there is large uncertainty on the corrosion phenomena and/or on the corrosion velocity.A first technique uses acoustic emission measurements. Microphones are placed on the shell of the storage tank to receive sound waves coming out of the tank. Each sound wave is stored and the source of the noise is calculated by software. The sounds that can be associated with a general corrosion activity have a very high frequency. The data are processed in order to map the places where corrosion activity is found and to determine the density of the corrosion activity. The technique makes it also possible to determine different grades of corrosion activity, going from grade A (very small) to grade E(high corrosion activity). As a function of the established corrosion activity it can be decided to perform immediately an internal inspection on the storage tank (in case of grade E), to reschedule the next internal inspection to an earlier date or to repeat the acoustic emission measurements after a certain period.The acoustic emission technique also allows to detect leaks. These leaks are detected at other frequencies than the frequencies at which the general corrosion activity is detected. This technique makes it possible to detect small perforations in the tank bottom.Another technique to achieve an indication of certain corrosion phenomena is \"long range ultrasonics\". This technique admits to achieve a qualitative image of the status of the annular bottom plates (not from the entire tank bottom) by using guided waves.These external inspection techniques do not gather (quantitative) information about the corrosion velocity and can't be used to enlarge the inspection interval that is based on the corrosion velocity.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applying leak detection techniquesSeveral techniques can be applied to detect a leak in the bottom of a storage tank while the storage tank is in duty.A possible leak detection technique exists of cables placed in the underground at fixed distances. The conductivity of these cables changes if a product is detected in the underground.Larger leaks can be detected by looking for abnormal deviations in the fluid level in the storage tank. If a continuous level measurement is installed on the storage tank, it is possible to install an extra alarm in the control program. The alarm is generated when the fluid level decreases when there are no pumping activities out of the storage tank. "

        "Accident Description": "The task of the odorization plant was to add to the natural gas the necessary amount of the odorizing agent to enable early detection in case of gas leakages. It consisted of two reservoirs having a capacity of 1,200 litres each, connected through a flow measuring device and a filter, with two proportionating pumps and to a mixer with a capacity of 240 l/h.The plant was shut-down by the emergency team within 60 minutes after the initiating event. ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:Variable weather with rain after 16:00.In a natural gas station, about 800 kg of the odorizing agent (TetraHydroThiophene [THT]) were released to the atmosphere when a gasket of the filter located upstream of the metering pumps was accidentally ruptured. The plant was shut-down by the emergency team one hour after the accident occurred. Sand for absorbing, sodium hypochlorite for destroying and a perfume (GM-1135) for masking the odour were applied&nbsp; in the area involved in the odorizing spreading. They were able to recover about one third (about 200 kg) of the whole amount of released odorizing agent (the others two third, about 600 kg, were collected in the basin located under the plant). Contacts with the local fire brigade and police were made for distributing information on the accident to the public. The odorizing agent release resulted only in an asphalt impregnation in the area nearby the odorization plant. This kind of accident has been the first in this plant (and in similar ones) managed for a long time by ITALGAS. The gasket rupture was caused by the malfunction of the obturator of the pressure regulator that allowed a gas flow which resulted in an overpressure in the storage vessel containing THT. This resulted in the rupture of the gasket (made in Viton) of the filter in the measuring device placed on the flow line to the pumps. The pressure regulator was installed in November 1988 and was inspected regularly as follows:- visual inspections 3-4 times a week;- functional control during filling of the vessels containing odorizers (average twice a week).",

        "Finish Date": "2002-12-27 16:50:00",
        "Accident Description": "At 15:03 hrs in the isomerisation unit a mechanical rupture in one out of two compressors occurred. The compressors, which were working in parallel and were operating at a pressure of 20 bars, were dedicated to conveying the gas mixture needed for the isomerisation process. The rupture caused the release of a gas mixture containing hydrogen, which on coming into contact with air ignited forming a jet fire. The jet fire headed towards the adjacent benzene saturation (BenSat) section hitting the nearest equipment (a pressure vessel) located 14 m from the release point. Weakening of the BenSat structure, consequent release of benzene from these structures and extension of the fire, with substantial destruction of the section. The length of the jet-fire could not be calculated with precision because the flame hit against the nearby BenSat unit; if the jet had not been stopped by the BenSat unit, it could have had an estimated length of approximately 30 m.Off-site fire brigade teams intervened extinguishing the fire within approximately 1 hour and a half of work. No damage was reported to persons or to the environment.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident was caused by the mechanical rupture of the bottom of the reciprocating compressor in the isomerisation section. This rupture was probably caused by a failure of the crank mechanism made of piston rod and drive shaft that caused the beating of the piston on the cylinder-bottom of the compressor. The combined effect of the beating and of the operation pressure may have caused the failure of the nuts holding the cylinder bottom; the following energy release threw the cylinder bottom weighing 100 kg approximately 14 meters away.Due to the fact that the process control records did not register significant changes in the process parameters it has to be assumed that the failure of the crank mechanism was caused by aspects linked to maintenance or by a material defect.At time of this report investigations were being performed on the material fragments of the failed crank components. An official systematic investigation on the failure cause with an expert appointed by the court is expected.The clearance in the compressor between piston and cylinder bottom is 3 mm. According to the declarations of the operator, it appears evident that a mechanical interference between cylinder bottom and drive shaft may have occurred.The nuts holding the failed cylinder bottom were found with completely abraded threads whereas the bolts on the contrary were practically undamaged and a few were just slightly blackened.The flammable gas mixture was probably ignited by the beating and the friction of the failed crank mechanism or by an electrostatic charge built up through gas seepage.",
        "Consequences": "Substantial destruction of the BenSat unit; only a small part of the equipment could be recovered. In the isomerisation unit the loss of the compressor was registered, the compressor had practically to be completely substituted and was taken back into service in June 2003. For some months the isomerisation unit worked only with compressor K2901A.\n\nAt time of this report a quantification of the repair costs was not possible.The accident could have caused more severe damage without the adoption of effective response measures and the joint effort of the on-site personnel and the off-site fire brigades; even if the on-site emergency response organisation could be improved.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "The emergency response operation was managed by the fire brigade of Rome in collaboration with the on-site personnel.At approximately 15:00 hrs a loud anomalous noise coming from the isomerisation unit was heard by the personnel working near that unit. Reaching the place the person in charge realised that the noise was caused by compressor K-2901B and tried to stop the compressor via the emergency shut-off switch installed on the control panel near the compressor, then he went to the control room to order the activation of the emergency shut-down procedure, with the activation of the discharge system into the fuel-gas network and the rapid depressurisation by the blow down system.Immediately afterwards the violent release of a hydrogen rich gas mixture occurred from the compressor bottom, the jet ignited almost instantly and hit the adjoining part of the BenSat plant (approximately 14m). The refinery personnel closed the manual valves installed on the pipe mains and started extinguishing operations, activating the fixed cooling systems and the foaming system of the units involved and nearby units.Meanwhile (at 15:03 hrs) the onsite Emergency Control Centre team gathered and established communication with the Advanced Control Centre. At 15:12 hrs the Emergency Control Centre decided to alert the off-site fire brigade. Meanwhile the on-site emergency response team fought the fire from the southeast with a fixed high capacity monitor, from the south with two UNI45 extinguishing hoses, another fixed monitor positioned in the southwest, an extinguishing lorry with a monitor positioned on the northwest, two UNI170 extinguishing hoses in the northeast.At 15:16 hrs the Emergency Control Centre ordered the emergency shut-down procedure to be started for the entire establishment.At 15:30 the first off-site fire brigade team arrived on-site and started to support response operations on the north side, which was more exposed due to the wind blowing from the south and a major presence of fixed extinguishing systems on the south side.The size of the fire was greatly reduced by 15:50 because the compression section of the plant no longer fed the fire; the fire continued in the BenSat unit engulfing it with flames.At 16:25 the fire was practically extinguished, some small flames remained on the highest points; cooling operations continued. At 16:50 the emergency was called off.Meanwhile, at 15:26, the Mayor's office, the Carabinieri and the Prefecture were informed about the occurrence. During the emergency also the 118 - (sanitary emergency call number) intervened at 15:45 hrs. On-site, besides the Fire Brigade Commander of Rome, and the General Fire Brigade Inspector of the Latium Region, also the Prefect and a journalist from the news of the third national Television chain arrived at the refinery (respectively at 16:49 hrs and at 16:52 hrs); representatives from the police headquarters also arrived.Official action taken - legal action: At time of the present report a confrontation was in progress between the company and the supplier of the compressor. An official systematic investigation into the failure cause was expected to be started, subject to appointment of a consultant by the civil court of Rome. \nThe company had already requested a technical expert opinion.\n\n\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Corrective actions on the On-site Emergency Response ManagementEquipment-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compressor orientation-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vibration detection system-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; automatic cut-off valves at the compressor intake-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; functionality and location of the automatic shut-down buttons-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electric powering system and sectioningEmergency response planning and management-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; number and placing of the water and foam dispensers of the fixed extinguishing systems-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; number and placing of the monitors-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; performance of the extinguishing system in terms of delivery and capacity of the water supply-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accessibility of the hazardous areas with extinguishing equipment-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; performance of the extinguishing systems of the refinery and accessibility of appropriate personal protective equipment for the emergency response teams.- appointment of an interdepartmental working group, with the assignment to issue or supplement the emergency response procedures so as to better define the tasks both of the single emergency response team members as well as the tasks of operative personnel in charge of sectioning and shutting down the installations. The procedures will comprise specific checklists, made available also to the Emergency Control Centre, which will be more efficient in following and supporting operations on the field.- verify the sewage system with respect to the suitability to cope with emergencies- prepare a portable radio communication system, for use only during emergencies, in order to improve communication during emergency response operations.- optimise the availability and location of personal protective equipment- increase the possible intervention points, numerically insufficient- increase the flow rate of the extinguishing water network, verify the performance of the extinguishing water network in terms of flow rate and water storage capacity.With reference to the experience gained and the updating studies carried out the following measures are planned by the company:Structures and equipment:- substitute the reciprocating compressors with a single centrifugal compressor in view of developing the isomerisation unit;-adopt electrically driven shut-off valves at the intake to be mounted near the compressor (the old valves were manually driven), so as to significantly limit any possible gas leakage;- improve the placing of hydrants and fixed monitors. Concerning management and documentation aspects:- improve the localisation of personal protective equipment;- improve the training of the personnel concerning the management of emergencies; systematic call-up of the emergency response team with drills every 15 days;- define for all equipment the sequence of operations needed to secure the equipment;- overhaul the electric securing systems of the machines, defined as a priority with respect to securing the process equipment;- update the risk analysis carried out for the safety report;- start the necessary procedures to tune the on-site emergency plan to the accident scenarios identified in the safety report."

Reportable due to quantity released: 750000 cubic metres of gas (weight approx 94 tonnes,c. 50% of top tier quantity)At approximately 11.30 am on Monday 9 August 1999 the energy distribution control (EDC) contacted Redcar blast furnace (RBF) control room and reported a dip in gas make from the furnace.&nbsp; No alarms were reported from RBF and the gas make appeared to returnto normal.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards however carbon monoxide alarms went off in the power station (range of CO levels, 40-80 ppm on turbine floor) and it was noticed that the gas make had not returned to its normal level.&nbsp; A check was made of the gas line to determine the source of the gas leak.&nbsp; It was reported that the leak was from the ERT inlet valve and the ERT was tripped.&nbsp; When it came off line the full flow of the blast furnace gas was directed down the clean gas main.&nbsp; In fact the leak was from the demister plate valve, this increased the leak and also, because of the pressure build up in the system caused a pressure sensor situated upstream of the demister plate vAlve to trip at 170mbarg so opening flare stack leg A and allowing the contents of the gas holder to escape to the flare stack.&nbsp; The flare stack was not lit (see below) and the gas was released unflared.&nbsp; Levels of carbon monoxide of 100ppm were recorded around the ramp at no 1 slag pit.&nbsp; At around the time that the ERT was tripped it was noticed that the leak was actually from the demister plate valve and blowing across the top of the ERT building then towards the bag filter house and towards the power station.&nbsp; Part of the cast-house floor of the blast furnace were within the path of the gas.&nbsp; Personnel were evacuated from the cast-house floor of the furnace however casting was in progress and some personnel were required to complete the cast before the plant could be made safe.&nbsp; These personnel were given Draeger comopac carbon monoxide monitors and returned to the casthouse to complete the cast.&nbsp; In the meantime the furnace was taken off blast to reduce the flow of gas.&nbsp; It was reported that the highest levels of gas (200ppm) were found on the rocker bay below the cast house floor.&nbsp; During the release the alarms in the ERT building were set off by carbon monoxide, these are set to go off at 2000ppm.&nbsp; The blast furnace was brought off-blast, an operation which took some time and necessitated the opening of the bleeder valves at the top of the furnace which introduced another release source for the gas during the incident.&nbsp; The u-seal between the blast furnace and the clean gas main was put into place at around 12:20 and the incident declared closed at 13:14 although the blast furnace had not been completely brought off blast at this time.&nbsp; Theexact amount of gas released during the incident is unknown although a British Steel calculation estimates that 130 tonnes were lost through the demister plate valve and 77 tonnes from the gasholder unflared through the flare stack (the gas holder was estimated to be 40% full at the time of the incident).&nbsp; Unusual weather conditions for August, North-easterly wind and heavy rain.&nbsp; Prevailing wind Westerly hence gas cloud moved towards plant instead of off-site.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Plate valve used for isolation of gas main during shutdowns and normally kept in open position closed due to electrical short-circuit allowing hydraulic operation of the valve.  Valve did not fully close and seal blown off by closing into full gas flow, leak occurred through annulus of valve.  System of work in place where hydraulics isolated and locked off when valve in open position had not been followed and electrical fault led to valve closing.  Blast furnace shut down but residual pressure in gas holder led to continuation of release, some gas flared but c.750,000 cubic metres lost via valve.The site is a new\nentrant COMAH top-tier site and little previous work has been done to\nevaluate the managemnet system in place to prevent and mitigate\npotential major accidents. The assessments above are from information\nreceived during the investigation into the release. These aspects will\nbe considered in more detail during inspection as part of the\ninspection plan. No entry written.The investigation involved two main areas of interest, the demister\nplate valve itself and the flare system, these are dealt with\nseparately below.&nbsp; \na)&nbsp; Initial investigations showed that the reason the demister plate\nvalve had shut was because of an electrical short circuit between\nrelays 28767 the local emergency stop and 28777 the local closed push\nbutton relay in the demister plate valve location box.&nbsp; This box had\nbeen designed to IP65 however a compression joint in one of the top\nglands had been incorrectly fitted so that part of the steel wire\narmouring of the cable was above the level of the seal hence water\ningress was possible.&nbsp; This short in itself however should not have\nbeen sufficient to cause the closure of the plate valve as British\nSteel procedures required physical isolations to be fitted to the\nelectrical input to the local box together with the electrical and\nmanual operation of the plate valve clamps situated in the hydraulic\nshed below the plate valve.&nbsp; None of these three isolations&nbsp; were\nfitted at the time of the incident.&nbsp; There are a number of procedures\non TEMS (Total Engineering Management System) which relate to\noperations on the demister plate valve.&nbsp; Of these, Job Safety Procedure\nJFP607 refers to operation of the plate valve during shutdowns and\nincludes details on both closing and opening the valve.&nbsp; The procedure\ndetails the need to isolate the valve electrical and hydraulic systems\nto prevent unauthorised valve operations.&nbsp; The isolations referred to\nin JFP607 for the valve when in the open position are detailed in\nisolation no.IF4494,these are; the gas plant isolation valve hydraulic\nhouse below the valve at the north end of the demister); and the gas\nplant isolation valve electric actuator on the platform adjacent to the\ngoggle valve actuator in the gas main.&nbsp; When the valve is in the closed\nposition there is an additional electrical isolation in the switch\nhouse.&nbsp; The isolations are made by way of isolocks on the local\nisolators which are secured by an EBI lock.&nbsp; There is a master key\nwhich fits all EBI locks, this is kept in a key cabinet in the RBF\ncontrol room and issued via a signing out book.&nbsp; The key to the key\ncabinet is kept to the side of the communications panel in the control\nroom and is easily accessible.&nbsp; The last shutdown which required\nclosing of the demister plate valve was carried out at the end of\nJune.&nbsp; There are no records in the key signing out book between 30 June\nand 9 August when, following the release the isolocks and EBI locks\nwere observed to be lying on the windowsill in the hydraulic house\nbelow the valve at the north end of the demister.&nbsp; In 1996 and 1997 a\nquality improvement programme (QIP) was initiated which looked at all\naspects of operation of the plate and goggle valves in the clean gas\nmain.&nbsp; The minutes of the meetings are attached.&nbsp; Issues raised during\nthe QIP included the identification of the valves (as problems had been\nencountered where personnel meant different valves when that used a\nparticular number) and safe operation of the valves.&nbsp; Concern was\nexpressed about the level of isolation of plate valves as the manual\nhydraulic override was not isolated.&nbsp; A was raised in which it was\nstated that the actuation of a plate valve during furnace operation\ncould result in a large release of gas and recommended the isolation of\nthe manual hydraulic clamp release on the plate valves.&nbsp; Following the\nplate valve QIP a committee was set up to look at the implications of\nCOMAH for the blast furnace.&nbsp; During a meeting on 23rd July 1997 a list\nof the top ten scenarios for major accidents occurring on RBF were\npresented, failed operation of plate valve PIV7 was included on this\nlist.&nbsp; In addition to the procedures for safe operation of the plate\nvalve, TEMS holds routines for the inspection of plate valves by both\nelectrical and mechanical inspectors.&nbsp; There are separate electrical\nand mechanical routines for all plate valves, some examples are\nattached.&nbsp; Those for electrical inspections are typically on a two to\nfour week frequency and include a reference to checking that isolations\nare in place.&nbsp; In the case of PIV7 however the reference to check that\nthe isolation was in place was added after the incident on 9th August\nso prior to the incident there was no requirement for electrical\ninspectors to carry out checks that the isolations were in place on\neither the electrical junction box adjacent to the demister plate valve\nor in the hydraulic house despite there being requirements to check\nthese isolations on other plate valves.&nbsp; The schedules for mechanical\ninspections for the plate valves are similar to those for the\nelectrical inspections and again there are no instructions on the job\nfor PIV7 to check isolations are in place whereas these are present on\nsome of the job schedules for other plate valves.&nbsp; Two routine\nelectrical inspections of the plate valve were carried out between the\nshutdown at the end June and the gas release but TEMS contains no\ncomments as to the presence or otherwise of the isolations at these\ninspections.&nbsp; \nb) Originally it was thought that the flare had ignited and the gas\nfrom the gas-holder had been flared, it soon became apparent however\nthat this was not the case and that raw gas was released from the flare\nstack during the incident.&nbsp; Operation of the flare stack can be\ninitiated manually or by the tripping of one or more of five pressure\nswitches situated as shown in the attached diagram.&nbsp; Switches 1 and 2\nare set to trip at 173mbar and open flare leg A, switch 3 is set at\n80mbar and opens legs A, switch 4 is set at 85mbar and opens leg B and\nswitch 5 is set at 95mbar and opens leg C.&nbsp; In addition there is a\npressure transmitter which ties in with the gas holder level system and\nacts to open leg C.&nbsp; The flare is not normally lit but lights by means\nof an air and propane ignition system when a leg opens.&nbsp; During the\nincident on 9th August, pressure switch 2 tripped due to a build up of\nblast furnace gas around the demister plate valve and so it was leg A\nwhich opened.&nbsp; At the time of the incident the flare was in an alarm\nmode and so there was no ignition when the flare was opened.&nbsp; The flare\nhad been in alarm since at least 1st August (there were no records\navailable prior to this date but no action had been taken to reset the\nflare which was done by manually operating a button at the base of the\nflare stack.&nbsp; Visual display of the alarm is given in the control room\nat RBF, when the alarm comes in there is an audible alarm and a\nflashing light however once accepted the audible is canceled and the\nlight remains on but does not flash.&nbsp; It is thought that the contents\nof the gas holder were lost through the flare in around 7 minutes.&nbsp;\nDuring the investigation into the failure of the flare system to ignite\nduring the incident it was discovered that in fact none of the flare\nlegs was operable and consideration was given to the service of a COMAH\nProhibition Notice however action to restore temporary propane\nsuppllies to the flare legs brought the flare back into use until\nrepairs were carried out.\n",

        "Emergency response": "The on-site emergency plan was not formally initiated although Cleveland Fire Brigade did attend the site however were not called upon to take any action.  An attempt was made to close the main entrance to the site however other entrances were not closed and operators from the afternoon shift were able to come onto site and relieve their opposite numbers from the morning shift during the incident.  On a number of occasions the relief was handed a comopac carbon monoxide monitor which was already in alarm mode.Official action taken - other official action: HSE enforcement management model applied with input from HID B2(C), the outcome was a letter which has been sent.  Management systems audit proposed.",

Fine\ninstruments damaged in the chlorine control room of the facility. Seveso II duties  - remarks: At the time of the accident the Seveso II wasn't in force in Hungary, but the company owned the adequate documentations.",
        "Emergency response": "After the alarm, the workers of the plant tried to cease the gas leakage, and in the meantime they directed the other employees from the area over the fence No 2. In parallel with this action, the mayors of the towns in the vicinity were informed. The firefighters, the ambulance, the National Public Health and Medical Officer Service (ANTSZ), the relevant environmental inspectorate and the civil protection units were alarmed. Constant air pollution monitoring was carried out. Elimination began after the alarming of these bodies. Emergency measures - Remarks: The unloading of the chlorine from tanker to storage tank was begun on 24th July 1999. At this time 4850 kg was unloaded. Purging was carried out and the pipelines were removed. The tanker was reconnected on 29th July again and unloading was begun, which was completed on 30th July. The pipeline was purged after unloading. At this time the tanker remained connected for unloading. On 7th September, the unloader was intended to be sprayed by sand and so that the tanker would not be affected by this action, they intended to fix it. At the fixation, the nitrogen connection was removed, it was no problem, however the operator observed leakage during the disconnection of liquid chlorine discharging pipe. At this time the valve was attempted to close, which did not move, and the chlorine began to leak. After this, the worker on the ground put on a breathing equipment and attempted to close the apparatus. The valve spindle rotated freely, therefore the manual valve was inoperable. According to the operator, based on the position of the handle, the bottom spring safety valve was in closed condition. The alarm was initiated by the chief foreman, the firefighter brigade of the facility moved to the site and started the absorption of the constantly leaking chlorine by establishing water shield. In the meantime the alarmed units arrived to the site (firefighters, policemen, chemical rescue team of BC Rt.). The arrived civil protection unit carried out constant measurements. Hazardous material did not get into the atmosphere. The chlorine\nleakage ceased at 5 pm, 30 minutes later the units returned to their\nquarters. After this the damage assessment and the reconstruction works\nbegan.Official action taken - legal action: There was no legal action. The expert's report on the damage was accepted by all authorities. Environmental authority requested Action plan, the implementation of which was checked. Official action taken - other official action: The operator had to pay 4,000 Euro fee for the labour protection authority.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: The managing director released an Action plan including 11 clauses to avoid further accidents, which were presented to the workers and they have it kept strictly. Measures to mitigate consequences: The Action plan released by the managing director contains it.Useful references: Action plan released by managing director."

        "Causes of the accident": "Primary causeThe day before the incident, a worker forgot to close a purge valve on an LNG recovery circuit. As a result, gas was injected into the unloading line until the gas detectors detected the leak. The surveillance patrols and temperature sensors did not spot the leak.\nRoot causesAn in-depth analysis of the event showed the following:\n\nthe different shifts had different practices for locking gas purgers to loading bridges;\nthe locking method and its tracing were described only partially;\nthe workers lacked a clear and comprehensive picture of the operations carried out and the condition of the circuits of the gas purger;\nthe route and purpose of the surveillance patrols were not described clearly and were open to interpretation.\n",
        "Consequences": "The concrete slab of the intermediate platform was covered with frost (expansion of the released gas) over an area of 20&nbsp;m&sup2;. It is estimated that 26,000m3 of LNG was released into the atmosphere (about 17 t at atmospheric pressure).

The valve had never been serviced.The event was caused by the sudden ejection of the control shaft of the ball valve while opening the valve. The failure was caused by the age of the valve, and the probable wear of the bush thread, the valve was constructed in 1966 (installed in 1967). The rupture of the control shaft caused the release of LPG under pressure (approx. 5 kg/cm2) through the cylindrical opening formed by the control shaft housing of the valve. A total amount of 15,000 to 16,000l of LPG corresponding to approximately 8 tons of product were released.",

        "Emergency response": "The on-site emergency plan was activated involving the nearby refinery, with monitoring of the gas cloud, the off-site emergency plan was activated involving the fire brigade, the prefecture, the municipality and the police forces, the personnel not needed for the emergency response operations were evacuated.Emergency measures - Remarks: The first emergency measure taken by the on-site emergency response service and the emergency response personnel of the neighbouring installations Saras and Polimeri Europa was to dilute and confine the gas cloud with water sprays. In particular the personnel of Saras stationed themselves externally on the southern part with monitors and installed water curtains fed by the refinery water network, while the personnel of Polimeri Europa positioned themselves externally on the eastern part of the installation with sprays fed by with a water tender.The first fire brigade team arrived at 8:05 hrs and substituted the personnel of the installation in the response operations.Subsequently water was pumped through the pipe coming from the Saras refinery, usually used for transferring LPG from the refinery into the storage tanks. The water was pumped at a higher pressure than the pressure inside the tank (approximately 5 kg/cm2), so as to displace the LPG in the bottom of the tank and substitute it in the leakage.This measure allowed&nbsp; the surrounding area to be made secure by 9:30 hrs and to approach the ruptured valve and seal it by 10:00 hrs.The LPG remaining in the tank was then transferred to another adjacent tank.The off-site emergency plan was activated.Discussion about response: The environmental conditions in which the accident developed were such that the employment of all foreseen emergency response means was possible, thus avoiding the evolution of the accident event.\nThe accident analysis showed that pumping water into the tank was a very effective measure. \nThe accident was caused by the rupture of a ball valve shaft installed on the liquid outlet pipe of the tank which was ejected from its seat while opening the valve. The valve had been installed at the time the installation was built, 35 years earlier; therefore the substitution of these valves should be more frequent.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate Lessons: Similar valves were substituted also on the other tanks, the new valves installed have an improved safety design (better technology), the refurbishing operations of the installation were brought forward."

        "Causes of the accident": "The 1,500 t sphere (which still contained 100 t of butadiene) was being emptied in preparation for a major turnaround of the manufacturing unit for maintenance and inspections. The operation involved filling the sphere to the top with water to transfer the residual butadiene by overflow to a second sphere. The supply rate of the sphere was increased during the operation by installing a DN 100 diameter, 10 bar supply pipe, without assessing the associated risks. The resulting flow rate was too high compared to the overflow rate to the second sphere. The pressure in the first sphere therefore increased until the valve opened. There are no concerns about the calibration of the valve.\nThe incident was the result of a change in the list of points to be checked (change of supply rate) for an emptying operation, with an insufficient assessment of the risks associated with that change.",
        "Consequences": "Measurements at the limit of properties showed low initial concentrations of 25 ppm that fell to 5 and 0 ppm after 30 minutes and 1 hour 20 minutes respectively. The emergency services used 2,200 litres of foam. The volume of fire water collected in the basin was 800 m&sup3;. &nbsp;The butadiene concentration measured was 38.6 ppm. The mixture was pumped and then treated with activated carbon. The amount of butadiene released into the atmosphere is estimated at 8 t (calculated using mass balance).",
        "Emergency response": "Two operatives equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) shut off the water supply within a few minutes and the valve closed. The sprinkler network was activated by the two operatives. The operator launched the internal emergency plan. The gas alarm was sounded and the plant staff were put into lockdown. The operator informed the neighbouring municipalities.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The remedial action concentrated on improving the checklists:\n\nby including warning and information points for operatives, incorporating the main safety points (limitation) and explaining the background to these points;\nby specifying whether they involve equipment that could give rise to serious scenarios;\nby ensuring a process of validation by the process safety service, in particular for the equipment that could give rise to scenarios taken into account in the technology risk management plans (plans de pr\u00e9vention des risques technologiques - PPRT).\n"

        "Accident Description": "Release of liquefied butane (LPG) from a 6\" pipe under an empty spherical tank of 6000 m3 due to the opening of a valve, with the consequent constitution of a pool which evaporated forming a flammable cloud which deflagrated when it reached the ignition source some 200 m away, producing a pressure wave and a thermal radiation wave (UVCE), causing different effects, among others also one fatality. After the deflagration of the cloud, the pool and the product released from the pipe caught fire, which could be extinguished only after an hour, also a series of repetitive fires spread all over the plant.Comments: [TEXT 2]\nAccident Gravity Scale=4\n\nDue to the opening of a valve a  release (1102) of liquefied butane occurred from an 6 (6\") inches pipe at the bottom of a 6000 cubic metres (6000 m3) sphere (spherical tank) which was empty end inertised (degasified), with the consequent formation of a liquid pool which evaporated forming a flammable gas cloud which when it reached an ignition point , at approx. 200 metres (20 m), deflagrated producing a pressure wave and thermal radiation (1204). After the deflagration of the cloud, the liquid pool and the product released from the pipe which were ignited (burning) (1203) could be extinguished only 1 hour later, as well as a series of repetitive small fires around all the plant (1999).Meteorological conditions - Precipitation: noneMeteorological conditions - Wind speed: 1.00Meteorological conditions - Wind direction: SEMeteorological conditions - Wind stability: AMeteorological conditions - Temperature: 25.00Meteorological conditions - Remarks: due to the low atmospheric stability and the low wind speed, it appears that the butane (cloud) spread in all those directions it was free to flow instead of being pushed by the windDiscussions about the occurrence: the emergency (occurrence) started at 8:42:39 with the opening of the valve, at 8:48:20 the butane cloud deflagrated; at 8:54:55 the first fire-fighters vehicle arrives, at 10:25:00 the situation is under control (the offsite emergency plan is called off) and at 11:25:00 all emergency plans are deactivated.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The valve (5105) separating a liquid&nbsp; butane line (pipe) with the atmosphere, opened apparently spontaneously (5999). Concerning other aspects human failure has to be considered (taken into account), due to the fact that the system has been designed with such a high inherent risk (such a high, relevant consequence with only&nbsp; one safety element, device, system) (5308). And finally some organisational and operational aspects (problems) of the onsite emergency plan have to be considered and particularly those concerning the inter-phase with the exterior (external communication)b (5303, 5304).",
        "Consequences": "The effects are mostly due to radiation and overpressure, caused by the deflagration, apart from the structures affected within the cloud at the moment of the explosion, 18 persons were affected, of which 3 were particularly affected by radiation and 4 by overpressure. The most seriously affected were two burnt workers, who were at about 50 - 70 metres distance in a straight line from the spreading fire (flare, flashing flame), one of which died as a consequence of the burns. 24 adjacent (neighbouring) establishments (companies, plants) were\nevacuated as a prevention measures (in order to avoid other damages).Damage to nearby buildings, the filling station building with serious structural damages, office rooms with cracks in the walls of 100 metres, ruptured windows at 120 metres distance from the company, rupture of asbestos panels (Eternit = panels of asbestos cement or similar used for roof covering) at 150 m distance from the company, rupture of roof coverings at 150 m, throwing of debris up to 300 metres.&nbsp; The establishment (plant) is located in an industrial area between two large cities which outskirts (external areas) were affected by the accident, that is why regional effects are also indicated.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localAffected Area: off-site: regional",
        "Emergency response": "Initially when the release was recognised the alarms / sirens of the company were activated (sounded (7106), this signal activates the onsite emergency plan (7101), the first action (operation) of it is to put all processes in the maximum safety state (situation, condition) (7104), the workers assume their assigned roles for emergency situations (7107), the activation of a series safe-guards like activating the sprinklers for cooling the spherical tanks, activation of extinguishing water run-offs control meansures (7108), the information (call of) external services  of which the fire-fighting services (7201) the police (7203) entered on-site whereas off-site the affected (victims) were received (taken over) and treated with the help of the medical emergency services (7202), traffic control(7208), evacuations (7404). After the accident work is under way to rebuilt (restore) the conditions (situation) as before the accident in order to get back to a safe condition, and afterwards for dismantling the establishment (company), (7602)Official action taken - other official action: a series of recommendations was made which should be implemented, like the installation of a system for the direct communication of the company with the (external) emergency servicesDiscussion about responce: From the aspect of the external impact of the accident, the major problem can be found in the insufficient onsite-offsite communication, which caused a relevant co-ordination problems between the external servicesEmergency measures taken  - Description: On the one hand, the on-site emergency plan of the company was activated, which foresaw the evacuation and the activation of different safeguards, like refrigeration systems of the tanks, some of which failed. On the other hand, the off-site emergency plan was activated, which meant for the public officers blocking the access of an area of 350 m around the company and the evacuation of the companies in this area.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: no specific measure has been defined at the moment ( the causes are still under investigation), it seems (appears) that the valves should be put in such condition to be not movable when not in use ( interruption of power, energy shutdown)&nbsp;Measures to mitigate consequences: It is necessary to improve the external relations (communication), a direct communication system between the off-site emergency communication centre and the company is necessaryUseful references: an accident scenario similar to the accident which occurred had been foreseen and simulated, the result  of the simulation fits (corresponds) sufficiently with the real occurrence. The simulation was realised with commercial computer codes (software) which were not to complex."

        "Accident Description": "The accident is an accident of operation: operators experienced difficulties in putting into equilibrium a purification column during start-up after a triennial maintenance shut down. A poorly-controlled pressure rise caused significant damage to the installation. The amount of damage is sufficient to make this accident notifiable under the Seveso II Directive.\n \nThe accident is classified on level 3 of the severity scale on the basis of the criteria \"material damages within the establishment\" (30 MF or 4.6 MEuros). \n",
        "Causes of the accident": "The malfunctioning of the column was primarily due to the inappropriate presence of water, which reacted with the di-isocyanate. A subsequent inspection revealed that one of the two boilers at the bottom of the column was leaking where a tube had been cold-joined to its support plate. In addition, during the accident, the operators experienced difficulties in controlling the variations of pressure and temperature on the right hand side of the column. In particular, the column had been re-supplied with at about 13.00, when it had been barely stabilised. The 3 downstream units which use Isocyanate Toluene are supplied with the product almost in line, and therefore require rapid start-up of Isocyanate Toluene purification.",
        "Consequences": "The damage (column plates deformed and out of use) has been estimated at 30 MF (4.6 Meuro), and the loss of production at 0.5 MF/day. Three downstream establishments using Isocyanate Toluene have also had to reduce their activities.",
        "Emergency response": "The opening of valves to remove the residues (ammonia...) involved the temporary evacuation of the personnel present in the unit. External fire fighters were called in to reduce the temperature of the installation. The fire-fighters hosed down the column until 7.15a.m. the following day.",

        "Accident Description": "At 13.22hrs a jet flame erupted from the front manhole of a 7.9 m long, 2.7 m diameter still base that was being cleaned out by operators using a metal rake. For about 3 hours before and whilst raking was taking place heat was applied through an internal steam battery that was submerged below the tarry residue. The steam supply was at about 135 psig corresponding to a steam temperature of approximately 180\u00b0C.When the jet flame erupted it impinged on a nearby control building of wooden construction and a large brick built office behind. The jet consumed the control building in its path killing 2 employees instantly. Two others in the control building later died from burns. The jet caused a fire in the office block which produced smoke and fume. A young female employee was found in the building approximately 30 minutes after the initiating event. She had been overcome by fume and had suffered a hearth attack from which she did not recover. 3 other employees sustained reportable injuries. One was detained in hospital with 15% burns and a number of other employees suffered psychological effects resulting from trauma and shock. Fire damage was confined to the site and water used to extinguish fires at the still base, control cabin and office block were contained and did not contaminate the river and canal which run through and around the factory site. There were no injuries to persons or damage to property off-site. The HSE investigation concluded that the incident resulted from self heating and runaway exothermic decomposition of thermally unstable residues in contact with heated steam pipes. This led to a jet flame with a surface emissive power of about 1000kw/m2 which lasted approximately 25 seconds.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Management failure to provide a safe system of work for removal of potentially unstable highly energetic residue from a vessel which had not been opened and cleaned for many years. These failings were characterised by a number of errors including:-i) Failure to test the residue and atmosphere inside the vessel;ii) Application of heat to the residue;iii) Use of a metal rake;iv) Failure to blank off an inlet before the work commenced, etc.",
        "Consequences": "Approximately 200 persons were exposed- 5 persons killed by fire;- 1 was hospitalized;- Material damage: total loss of the control building. Extensive fire damage to the&nbsp;&nbsp; internal fabric of the main office building. Amount: 1.25 millions Pounds.",
        "Emergency response": "Internal fire crew responded to extinguish fires at the still base and the control cabin after the jet had subsided. The on-site fire alarm was sounded, the emergency services were called and employees followed the company's fire evacuation and assembly procedure.Roads around the factory were sealed by the police and 22 units from the Fire Service attended. They concentrated on the office block fire and carried out a search and rescue for missing persons. After the female casualty was found she was transferred to hospital by a police helicopter. The fire service took water from the nearby river to fight blazes on site. Within days of the incident a significant number of fire service personnel reported sick with a variety of symptoms including eye and skin irritation, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.The public Health Department investigation that followed looked at 2 possible causes, ie toxic and gastro intestinal effects. No evidence was found to implicate toxic chemicals arising from the fire but a viral source was identified for the outbreak of gastro intestinal problems. This may have been associated with food and drink consumed at the site.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate shutdown of the Meissner Plant. The new operations director strengthened area production management to ease the workload of middle managers. Risk management consultants were brought in to review changes proposed to the Meissner plant before start up. The main office block was taken out of use.The implications with regard to off-site emergency planning have been reviewed.External to the Establishment:As above. Risk assessment consultants have also been commissioned to review all other chemical manufacturing processes on the site."

The column was vented, then followed by a vapour clean-up (on May 28 to 29) and finally flushed with water. The actual major maintenance programme was started on May 30. The operators were inspecting plates inside the column and welding on the main \"hard\" pipe (1 m diameter) when an internal flash fire burst suddenly, killing two operators inside the column and injuring 5 other workers. In the Original Report there is no evidence of sulphur dioxides release during the accident.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident was probably caused by the spontaneous burning of pyrophoric iron sulphides deposits in the column (code 5107). Such deposits may appear in equipment made in ferrous alloys shells where hydrocarbons contaminated with sulphur are handled. The procedures for the preparation of the units to maintenance operations were inadequate (codes 5303 and 5307) because did not take into account the possible formation of the iron sulphides deposits.",

        "Accident Description": "The incident occurred on Blast Furnace Nr 5, which was constructed in 2001-2002. The blast furnace is used for the making of iron as part of the steelmaking process. At 23:00 hours a large leak of blast furnace gas was seen emerging from a circumferential crack in the downcomer by an operator who heard a hissing noise. The downcomer carries this gas from the top of the furnace to storage via the dust catcher. Leakage of blast furnace gas continued for 26 hours from the crack, which measured 2.3m in length and up to 3mm in width. The operator estimates that 24 tonnes of gas was released. The location of the crack was at one of the banded welded joints made during the construction of the downcomer, the incident did not trigger the on plant gas detection system. No ignition and fire of this extremely flammable and toxic gas occurred.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The primary cause of the incident was the occurrence of a gapping circumferential crack in sleeved welded joint number 7. &nbsp; The following factors are all relevant to this failure:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The condition of the refractory lining which may have led to differential thermal expansion across hot spots. The top gas temperature in the furnace could reach 900 deg. C causing the steel in unprotected areas to heat up to 670 deg C in a 5 minute excursion;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of the downcomer did not take into account that such temperatures could be reached, nor that parts of the refractory lining could be missing;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operation of the blast furnace was not adequately controlled over a number of years in that there were repeated high temperature excursions experienced in the downcomer;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality control procedures during the fabrication of the downcomer, including NDT, were inadequate. This led to defects in the fabrication and welding of the banded joints that were outside of design tolerances. There were also defects in the refractory lining caused by leaving wooden stop ends in place which burned away during operation to leave unprotected steel surfaces;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standards of workmanship found were below those expected for a structure of this type.In 2002, the completed fabricated downcomer was transported several hundred metres at ground level before being lifted into position for site welding at joints 1 and 9 and the refractory lining may have been damaged then",
        "Consequences": "The outcome of the operator&rsquo;s failure to ensure that the downcomer was adequately designed, operated and maintained was a significant release of an extremely flammable and toxic gas over a 26 hour period, which was only stopped when a temporary steel patch repair was put in place. &nbsp; The release occurred at a fracture in joint number 7 which is around 50m above ground level. The release did not find an ignition source and was not able to accumulate in dangerous quantities near to personnel. &nbsp; There were no physical injuries reported.The company incurred substantial financial costs on work to repair the downcomer and comply with the Improvement Notice, and are considering whether to replace the downcomer in its entirety.",
        "Emergency response": "The company initially carried out a steel patch repair to the downcomer, which, as it was not considered as part of a formal management of change process, was poorly constructed to an inadequate design, and masked the extent of existing defects in joint 7 of the downcomer",
        "Lesson Learned": "Very early on in the investigation, the Competent Authority required the operator to comply with a statutory Improvement Notice served under Section 2(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, that required the following action to be taken&nbsp;in order to ensure the safety of employees and to demonstrate that the downcomer was adequately maintained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full review of the design of the downcomer on blast furnace number 5 should be carried out which should consider the adequacy of the design and whether integrity can be maintained under all foreseeable conditions of loading. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appropriate Non Destructive Testing (NDT) technique should be selected and qualified for use in examining the downcomer in order to determine significant defects that may be present. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualified NDT should be put into use on all circumferential welds on the downcomer, and on any other welds on the downcomer that the design review (see item 1) finds may be at risk of degradation. 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suitable thermographic camera(s) should be obtained and used in order to continuously monitor the condition of the downcomer and detect leakage of gases which may affect its integrity. 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A system of regular visual checks of the condition of the downcomer should be put in place, the results of which should be documented. The visual checks should include reference to both the downcomer itself and to images obtained from the thermographic camera(s) (see item 4) 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A time-bound plan for the future maintenance and thorough examination of the downcomer should be prepared. The operator complied in full with this Notice by 16 October 2009 and is now considering replacement of the entire downcomer Major lessons learned by the Operator for the future centre around Design of blast furnace and other plant Management of Integrity Procurement of plant and quality control during construction Process safety management and leadership"

        "Accident Description": "A nickel strike bath caught fire in an electroplating machine, presumably due to a cable fire. 8&nbsp;000 litres of electrolyte, comprising hydrochloric acid and nickel chloride, leaked out.\nDuring the fire, oxides and chlorine compounds were produced, as well as smoke and by-products of burning plastic.\nThe fire alarm system alerted the fire brigade. Leaked electrolyte and contaminated extinguishing water were pumped to the on-site waste water treatment plant.\nNo persons were injured or harmed.\nThe fire triggered an alarm at the fire station via the fire alarm system.\nThe pump of the pump sump automatically pumped out the electrolyte and the water used to extinguish the fire.\nAll of the water used to extinguish the fire as well as the leaked electrolyte could be collected by pumping it into appropriate collection tanks of the waste water treatment plant.\nSimilar incidents:22.7.2012 - Hydrochloric acid/nickel chloride mixture released at surface treatment plant.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause cannot be identified. One theory points to a cable fire, another to the overheating of the contacts in or on the bath.",
        "Consequences": "All of the piping, the rubber lining of the nickel strike bath, the valves of the baths (rinse and nickel strike bath), the suction boxes, the entire carriage and cables were burnt.\nThe roof and the waste water treatment plant were affected.",
        "Emergency response": "The pumps of the pump sump pumped out the electrolyte and the water used to extinguish the fire.\nThe fire brigade alerted the public.\nThe fire brigade extinguished the fire and then reopened the site after measuring the breathable air.\nThe site was decontaminated. The liquids collected were disposed of by a specialist disposal company, as were the contaminated electrolytes. The entire hall was cleaned by a specialist company. The waste was disposed of properly.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The following changes have been made:\n- The voltage applied is measured. If the maximum voltage is exceeded, electroplating is discontinued and a rectifier alarm is triggered.- When selectively cleaning the nickel strike electrolyte, the contacts are measured using an IR&nbsp;sensor.- Level monitors have been installed in the electrolytes.- The fire alarm system has been extended so that the hall is now also monitored.- In case of fire, the exhaust fans switch off.- The electrolyte heating units have been equipped with rod temperature limiters which switch the units off if the set temperature is exceeded.\nThe measures put in place served to prevent greater damage."

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:On December 21(Saturday), at 5:10 a.m in the AGIP coastal depot of Naples a very violent explosion (an unconfined vapour cloud explosion [U.V.C.E.]) followed by a fire occurred. The fire involved 25 tanks containing mainly light petroleum products. The sound of the explosion was heard at a great distance from the depot (up to Capri) and witnesses noticed the shock-wave up to Vico Equense. The explosion flame reached a length of hundreds metres. The explosion caused:1- the complete destruction of some buildings and damages to some industrial and civil premises in a radius of various hundred metres from the depot;2- the death of 4 people (two workers of the AGIP company inside the depot and two people living outside the depot, in a building beyond the Sperone channel;3- the injuring of many people hit by debris or fallen during the escape following the accident (the explosion caused a great panic in the population in a large area of the city);4- a large fire in the area of the SIF depot;5- serious damages to the road connecting the city of Naples (street \"Arnaldo Lucci\") to the high-way Napoli-Salerno;6- damages to the rail-way \"Circumvesuviana\".The fire that followed the explosion was characterized by high burning and energy rates of the combustion. There was risk of explosion of fixed roof tanks and propagation of the fire to the nearby areas (where there were others tanks) and to nearby critical industrial premises (Feltrinelli). Also, there was a risk of burned products flowing into the Sperone channel (with consequent damages to the activities in the harbour) and serious risks to the public health. Due to the successive collapse of some storage tanks engulfed in the fire, some fire-balls occurred and the flammable liquid contained was released into the dikes. It was a good choice to send foam (though more expensive) instead of water in the dikes to reduce the effects of the collapse of tanks. In this way the whole amount of available water was used to cool the tanks and the risk of dikes overfilling and, therefore, of the spreading of fire to other areas was avoided.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nDuring ship unloading operations, a leak of flammable/explosive liquid from tank No 17 occurred. The vapours were ignited resulting in a violent explosion which involved 25 tanks (SIF area) containing flammable substances. The explosion was followed by a fire that involved the SIF area.\nCAUSES:\nThe release of the flammable/explosive liquid from tank No 17 during loading operations was caused by the loose of control of the gate valves position by the two operators in charge of the operation. It caused the overfilling of the tank and the liquid overflowing from it. The released vapours formed a cloud that was ignited in an adjacent area, causing a violent unconfined vapour cloud explosion (U.V.C.E.).",
        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:2 people inside the depot (in charge of the unloading operations) and 2 people living in a destroyed building outside the depot were killed by the explosion. Many people (about 100) were injured (and hospitalized) because they were hit by debris or fallen during the escape following the accident (the explosion caused a great panic in the population in a large area of the city).MATERIAL LOSS AND COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:The accident caused great damage to the depot and to its structures. Also caused:1- the complete destruction of some buildings and damage to some industrial and civil premises in a radius of various hundred metres from the depot (about 220 civil buildings, 12 large buildings and 448 industrial or artigianal units were damaged);2- serious damage to the road connecting the city of Naples (street \"Arnaldo Lucci\") to the high-way Napoli-Salerno;3- damage to the rail-way \"Circumvesuviana\".MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX. DENSITY OF POPULATION:The depot was in an area with a high density of population, close to civil buildings.Ecological harm - Remarks: In the Original Report there is no evidence of significant ecological harms because, though there was a risk of burned products flowing into the Sperone Channel (with consequent damages to the activities in the harbour), nothing happened.Disruption of community life: A large area around the depot had been declared off limits. Ships had been moved away from the harbour.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:To fight the fire for avoiding its propagation to the nearest tank No 101 full of diesel oil and the ignition of the other tanks in case of their rupture and escape of flammable liquid, immediately after the explosion arrived on the scene:- 6 fire fighting teams,- the fire fighting team of the refinery;- the fire fighting team of harbour;- fire fighting teams from the other provinces of Campania.The day after, since the fire was still huge, others 180 firemen, 15 officers and many fire fighting means were called.Due to the successive collapse of some storage tanks engulfed in the fire, some fire-balls occurred and the flammable liquid contained was released into the dikes. It was a good choice to send foam (though more expensive) instead of water in the dikes to reduce the effects of the collapse of tanks. In this way the whole amount of available water was used to cool the tanks and the risk of dikes overfilling and, therefore, of the spreading of fire to other areas was avoided.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:1- a large area around the depot had been declared off limits and it was prohibited the entrance of the personnel;2- ships had been moved away from the harbour.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",

The first explosion dislodged the object and the camera became operational again, so the end of the event was filmed. A series of explosions occurred for less than 10 seconds before inflammable objects (rafters, boxes) caught fire.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The woman appears to have deliberately set fire to stored products, causing the explosion.\nFollowing the liquidation of the company at the end of 2015 and its takeover by a shareholder in March 2016, the former owner and his wife were still living in a house in the immediate vicinity of the pyrotechnic facility. The victim managed to get through the company\u2019s perimeter, probably via a hole made by dogs in the mesh fence separating her home and the site. The fence complied with the rules regarding height.\nThe site\u2019s intrusion alarm had been out of order since two days prior to the accident and was due to be repaired on the day of the accident. The operator therefore did not receive any message that the door to the store had been opened. Since the door of that building was blown off, there is no way of knowing whether it was broken into or whether the victim had a pass. The new operator has stated that, after taking over the company, it had changed the locks of some buildings but had not yet done so for the store concerned. The most recent site inspection had revealed that the doors, locks and remote monitoring station did not comply with the benchmarks in force (A2P2 and APSAD certifications).",
        "Consequences": "The woman who set off the explosion was killed.\nThe roof of the store (made up of wooden supports and fibre cement panels) was blown off, its door was burned and one of its walls cracked. No other building was affected. Light debris (pieces of wood, boxes) was projected no more than around 15&nbsp;m from the store. The fact that the store concerned was located quite far from the perimeter and surrounded by earthen embankments prevented material being projected outside the site.",
        "Emergency response": "A neighbour notified the firemen after hearing two explosions and seeing red smoke.The victim\u2019s body was found a few metres from the building.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The inspectorate ordered the operator to:&nbsp;&nbsp; - put the intrusion alarm back in service as quickly as possible;&nbsp;&nbsp; - check and repair the fence;&nbsp;&nbsp; - finish replacing the locks in all the doors in the facility\u2019s buildings."

It is observed that detector Nr. 36, located a few metres from the release point, did not detect any VCM at 7.50.17, it is concluded therefore that the CSM release occurred between 7.50.17 hrs and 7.51.38 hrs.The shift assistant was informed immediately over the phone by the personnel in the control room, that the sensor system indicated the presence of VCM onsite, he came directly into the control room. Also the operative assistant came into the control room, after he was informed via intercommunication system and had ordered the entire personnel to go to the emergency gathering points, as foreseen by the onsite emergency response plan.The external reactor assistant, equipped with self-respirator and a portable VCM-meter went to check the detector which triggered alarm. Successively also the shift foreman went to the release area equipped with self-respirator and reached the filter P24123/B almost contemporarily with the external assistant, there they both noticed that the filter was releasing two phase VCM from the flanged coupling in correspondence of the filter head.Following the most relevant actions undertaken by the workers to isolate the VCM leakage from the filter are listed.- The shift assistant closed the manually operated valve located upstream to the filter;- the plant maintenance assistant opened 2 gas relief valves to the gas flare and to the abatement system.- the operation assistant closed the manual valve located downstream to the filter, concluding the isolation operation of the filter.- the switchboard assistant closed the remotely operated valves XV24121 and XV121G located on the VCM feed manifold of reactors on line B, as shown in the technical operating scheme PM 33640 of the VCM feeding process - the switchboard operator successively depressurised the flare line such to transfer the VCM contained in the isolated line to the abatement system- the shift assistant, the process assistant, the plant assistant and the plant maintenance assistant checked that the leak of VCM was originated from the flanged coupling of the filter head, and tried to tighten the filter head bolts without obtaining an appreciable result.- the plant maintenance assistant , assisted by three department maintenance assistants opened the filter , extracted the candle filter package, mounted a new filter holding plate without candle filters and new sealing gaskets, after receiving the authorisation from the department manager.- the above described operations were executed in different moments: The plant workers started to spray the release area with water after the valve downstream of the filter had been closed..- the Integrated Emergency Management System of the Site was triggered and the day shift workers arriving to the establishment were blocked at the establishment entrance or directed to the emergency gathering points.- the fire brigade teams of Servizi Porto Marghera intervened and set up water curtains to abate the VCM in the affected department area.The Integrated Emergency Management System of the Site sent three messages concerning the evolution of the event.Time of the message8.17 PIE team in CV24 to check VCM release from the coupled flange of filter to reactors8.18 CV24: release stopped, circuit aspiring, teams assisting8.34 CV24: event ended, plant in safe condition",

        "Consequences": " ON-SITE:One worker was treated at the on-site medical services for cold burns caused by the exposition to VCM while responding to the event.Additional CommentsVCM is in gaseous state at ambient temperature and pressure. VCM is maintained in liquid state by applying a higher pressure than ambient pressure. If VCM in liquid state is released into the atmosphere, because its boiling point is -13\u00b0C, the VCM partly vaporises into a cloud which can cause cold burns on the skin.During the emergency response operation, while the worker was trying to isolate the failed filter by closing a manual valve downhill of the filter, the worker suffered a slight cold burn on his forearm caused by the contact with the handle of the manually operated valve, which was covered with ice due to the VCM release. The worker went to the onsite sanitary service for medical attention after alarm was called off.During emergency operations, another worker suffered from a temporary sensitisation of the hand while opening the valve of the gas release system, the symptoms disappeared without any medical treatment. The accident did not cause any off-site consequences.Area concerned:The environmental monitoring system of department CV24-25 is equipped with 52 gas sampling probes, the system analyses the presence of VCM (vinyl chloride monomer), ECF (ethyl chloroformate) and DCE (di-chloro-ethane), this has allowed to detect the VCM release in the area affected and the evolution of the VCM concentrations.The streams extracted by each sampling probe is sent to a mass spectrograph to determine the concentrations, the systems allows to detect concentrations from 0 to 100 ppm.The VCM monitoring is performed each 17 minutes, between each extraction of air samples by the sampling probes and the successive extraction, the analysis sequence is not numeric. The VCM release point is located inside a shed with three walls, partially opened to the exterior. The filter is located on a second floor some 8-10 m from the ground. On the ground floor are located polymerisation lines A and B constituted by a total of 14 reactors.The records of the values measured by each probe the day of the event (annex 4), show that during an extended period of time inside the shed. VCM concentrations reached values of more than 100 ppm (above the measurement limit of the instruments), probably due to the fact that the shed is only partially opened.In the polymerisation area a value above instrument measurement limit was measured at 7.51.38 by probe 30 (bottom of reactors 7 and 8) while probe Nr. 19 (comb of reactor 14) measured values above 100 ppm. also after 9.30 hrs. Probe Nr. 36 located near the release point registered VCM concentrations in the air above 100 ppm. Untill approx. 10.15. After that hour there are no records of VCM concentrations measured by the probes above 100 ppm.Also outside the polymerisation area there are some probes which registered VCM concentrations above 100 ppm: in particular probes 6 and 63 registered concentration peaks of VCM respectively at 8.15.14 and 8.09.06 in correspondence of road F located south- west from the release point, the measured values descended to 10 ppm respectively at&nbsp; 8.49.59 and 8.27.00.The probe located the farthest from the release point measured relevant concentrations of VCM, probe Nr. 61, located in correspondence to the gasholder some 120 m from the release point, measured a VCM concentration of 74.34 ppm. at 8.07.47 hrs, while the foregoing measurement and the successive one registered just CVM concentrations below 1 ppm.Also probe Nr. 44 inside the control room detected a VCM concentration of 93.28 ppm at 8.11.42 and then progressively decreasing values until values below 1 ppm.Ineos Vinyl has employed a mobile vehicle to monitor the VCM concentrations in the areas outside of the departments (annex 5 page 20)The mobile vehicle performed 28 progressive measurements at 12 minutes interval in relation to 9 different positions, of which 8 were inside a perimeter of 500 metres from the department and one measurement point was located between 00 and 1000 m from the department. The values measured by the mobile vehicle were in the range of a few ppm while inside the department the values measured were above 100 ppm.The position nearest to the city, monitored by the mobile vehicle, was position Nr. 7, the values were of 0,19 ppm and 0,8 ppm measured respectively at 11.34 and 11.46.People - Remarks:When the event occurred the shift personnel present insite was composed by:Shift personnel Position1 shift assistant in the office building3 switchboard operators in the control room1 external reactor operator in the control room1 external services operator in the control room1 external drying process operator in the office of the shift assistantThe day shift personnel starts work at 8:00 hrs. When the event occurred there was the following personnel present onsite.Day shift personnel Position1 plant assistant in the office building1 operation assistant in the office building1 plant maintenance assistant in the office building4 department maintenance assistants in the office building1 department safety assistant in the office building8 employees with the function \"maintenance and engineering\" in the office building1 SHE manger in the office building4 personnel of external contractors in the office building5 personnel members with the function of \"electric instrument maintenance\" in the electric instrument maintenance workshop.Non hospitalised injured persons.None of the persons present in the department or nearby areas was directly exposed to VCM, nor has presented symptoms relatable to the event.During all phases related to the emergency response, individual protective equipment with self respirators was employed. Self protective equipment with facial mask and specific AX filter or ABEK filter (annex 5 page 7)The company has presented a technical consultancy report on the impact of the VCM release made by Doct. Tommaso A. Dragani in which it is stated that: \"The VCM release on 6/07/2006 never constituted a health hazard\".During the emergency response operation a worker, while trying to isolate the failed filter by closing a manual valve downhill of the filter, suffered a slight cold burn on his forearm caused by the contact with the handle of the manually operated valve, which was covered with ice due to the VCM release. The worker went to the onsite sanitary service for medical attention after alarm was called off.During emergency operations, another worker suffered from a temporary sensitisation of one hand while opening the valve of the gas relief system, the symptoms disappeared without any medical treatment. There are no known offsite consequences to persons or known offsite material damage.Ecological Harm - Remarks:On 06/07/2006 at 14.07 hrs a water samples were taken from the sewage water discharged into the public sewage system at point SM2. The analysis made by the Societa Servizi Porto Marghera (SPM) indicates a concentration of 22,4 g/l of VCM, with respect to the threshold limit of 50 g/l.Test report 2006/5852 on a former test sample taken at 8:20 indicates a VCM concentration of 3.1 g/l.",
        "Emergency response": "ON SITEAccordino to environmental monitoring system equipped with VCM detectors (annex 4) at 7.51.38 sensor Nr. 30,positioned near reactors 7 and 8 detected the presence of VCM, indicating a value of &gt; 100 ppm (upper measurement limit). It is observed that detector Nr. 36, located a few m from the release point did not detect any VCM at 7.50.17, it is concluded therefore that the CSM release occurred between 7.50.17 hrs and 7.51.38 hrs.Analysing the data provided by the plant operator concerning the VCM detectors and the data obtained from the Distributed Control System (DCS), like the data registered by detector FI900 (mass flow meter) or PI906 ( pressure sensor of feeding line B) there is a discrepancy with the indicated timing.The operator declared (pag 5 annex 5) that the time indicated in the DCS is always 7 minutes and 29 seconds later than the time indicated by the sensors.The shift assistant was informed immediately over the phone by the personnel in the control room, that the sensor system indicated the presence of VCM onsite, he came directly into the control room. Also the operative assistant came into the control room, after he was informed via intercommunication system and had ordered the entire personnel to go to the emergency gathering points foreseen by the onsite emergency response plan.The external reactor assistant, equipped with self-respirator and a portable VCM-meter went to check the detector which triggered alarm. Successively also the shift assistant went to the release area equipped with self-respirator and reached the filter P24123/B almost contemporarily with the external assistant, there they both noticed that the filter was releasing two phase VCM from the flanged coupling in correspondence of the filter cap.According to the reconstruction made by the operator the timing was the following:7.52 signal from the mass spectrometer7.54reactor assistants goes to the release point7.55 the shift foreman goes to the release point7.58 Closure of the manual valve upstream of the filter7.58 Closure of the valve downstream of the filter8.00&nbsp; Start of gas relief operation8.03 shut off operation of the valve downstream of the filter completed and connection of the filter with the gas relief line and pressure relief.8.04 Alerting of the Operative Centre for Emergency Response of the industrial pole.The company alerted the Operative Centre for Emergency Response of the industrial pole (pag. 7 annex 5) by dialling 3333, requesting the assistance of an emergency response team to set up water curtains in order to avoid the dispersion of VCM and to abate the VCM in the area affected by the release. Afterwards the shift technician informed the fire department in Porto Marghera about the event and informed via FAX the authorities, on the starting and ending time of the emergency, as foreseen by the communication procedure of the company.The operator ordered, consequent to the event, all department personnel not involved in the emergency response to reach the gathering points, as foreseen by the on-site emergency response plan. At 9.15 hrs the operator called off the emergency and normal vehicle circulation conditions around the department and the access to the department were re-established.OFF SITEThe accident did not trigger the offsite emergency response plan, nor the alarm sirens placed on acoustic poles in the city of Marghera were activated to alert the population.Emergency measures - Remarks: At 8.04 hrs INEOS requested the intervention of the Operative Emergency Response Centre of the chemical pole. The emergency alert was passed to the fire brigade of the pole located 300-400 m from the accident place. the fire brigades of the company Servizi Porto Marghera intervened and took measures for the precautionary containment of the VCM by the means of water curtains. They installed the water curtains using the water distribution system of the department and specific equipment they brought. The shift technician of SPM (Servizi Porto Marghera) called the security service of the chemical pole, in accordance with the emergency response procedures of the establishment, to control the vehicle movement inside the establishment and the access to the establishment itself, the shift technician also activated the message transmission system of the Site Integrated Emergency Management System.The Integrated Emergency Management System of the Site sent three messages concerning the evolution of the event.Time of the message8.17 PIE team in CV24 to check VCM release from the coupled flange of filter to reactors8.18 CV24: release stopped, circuit aspiring, teams assisting8.34 CV24: event ended, plant in safe conditionThe alarm in the department does not represent an emergency situation for the Integrated Emergency Management System.In the report of INEOS dated 12/07/2006 (annex 5) it is stated that, apart from isolating the leaking filter the personnel responding to the emergency took the necessary measures to transfer the VCM from the filter to the abatement system.During the operation the technicians detected the persistence of the release from the failed filter gasket, due to an incomplete emptying of the filter itself. They substituted the failed gasket at 9.40 to assure the complete safety of the area affected.Official action taken - legal action:&nbsp;a)legal action\nThe competent Attorney General's Office of Venice opened a proceeding to evaluate the responsibility of the company with regards to the accident.\nFollowing a joint inspection of ARPA Venice and the public fire department of Venice (annex 14) a preliminary report has been issued.\n\nOfficial action taken - other official action: b) other official action\nThe Occupational Health and Safety Service of the Local Socio Sanitary Unit NR. 12 (Venice) prescribed according to art 20 of legislative decree 758/94 following measures to limit the consequences of similar accidents.\nThe Occupational Health and Safety Service prescribed refurbishment and improvement measures for the pressurisation and conditioning system of the control room of plant CV24/25, and the installation of adequate sanitary services apt to be used in case of accidental exposition to VCM of a worker.\n\nDiscussion about response: Concerning the notification of the accident to the European Commission  according to paragraph I.1 of Anex VI of legislative decree 334/99:\nThe occurrence has to be notified to the Commission as accidental release, if the assumption that 4000 kg of VCM were effectively released as measured by the flow-meter is considered credible; as the quantity corresponds to more than 5% of the threshold quantity for extremely flammable substances which is fixed for the application of art. 8 b - legislative decree 334/99 in 50 tons. \nSeveso II duties  - remarks: Organisation element existed Did element relate to actual circumstances of incident? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no yes no partly yes adequate inadequatewritten policy objectives&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X X X specified management structure X X Xspecified responsibilities X X X specified working procedures X X* X Xspecified procedures for assessment/auditing of management system X X** X specified procedures for review and update of management policy X X X specified general training procedures X X X specified emergency training procedures X X X**** There was no specific written procedure for the substitution of the gasket of the filter affected by the accident, further the tightening torque value of the filter cover bolts was not defined. The company used a generic procedure for the substitution of PTFE gaskets on RF type flanges (annex 13).** The company has performed an investigation on accidents, near misses and non conformities (registration Nr. 120/06) in the context of the Safety Management System, the report states that the fundamental elements of the SGS in play during an emergency are the operative control and the emergency planning.*** The emergency response procedure in case of VCM release foresees the remote shut off of the root valves. It is pointed out that the workers have closed the remote control root valves once they closed manually the isolating valves of the filter which was not foreseen by the emergency response procedure.Concerning the compliance with art 21 of legislative Decree 334/99 with respect to the Safety Report and to art. 25 of legislative Decree 334/99 with respect to the SMS assessment, the approval procedure of the safety Report presented in 2000 had been concluded while the approval process of the safety Report presented in 200 is still undergoing.The last assessment of the SMS made with the commission named by the Environmental ministry was concluded in 2002.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:&nbsp; a) measures to prevent recurrenceThe company declared that (annex 2):- the accident was caused by the failure of the sealing gasket of the cap of filter P24123/B installed on the reactor feeding line B. Possible causes of the accident:1. defective sealing surfaces (non planar surfaces, dirty surfaces)2. faulty tightening of the bolts after substitution of the candle filters3. failure of the gasket employedDue to the fact that it is not possible to identify one single accident cause it has been decided to take preventive measures concerning all 3 potential accident causes described above:1) refurbishment of all 4 filters P24123/A-B e P24104/B-C. The operator has provided to grind all gasket seats of the flanges and of the candle filter bearing plate, although the inspection and tests performed on the filter did not show any defects on the sealing surfaces, this operation was performed under the supervision of ARPA Venice.2) The tightening torque for the bolts of the flanged coupling was calculated and a procedure and regulation for the closure of filters P24123/A-B e P24104/B-C was established.3) Modification have been performed on the equipment in order to minimise from the source pressure variations during the VCM charging process of the reactors.4) The emergency response procedures of the department have been revised concerning the response to similar accidents. The personnel of the department has been trained concerning the emergency response and how to isolate the VCM lines in case of VCM release.5 A study on the possibility to install a double sealing system on the filter cover is foreseen.6) Compliance with the measures prescribed by the Occupational Health and Safety ServiceMeasures to mitigate consequences: b) measures to mitigate consequencesAfter the integrated emergency response system of the establishment triggered alarm, the fire brigades of the company Servizi Porto Marghera (SPM) intervened to and took measures for the precautionary containment of the VCM by the means of water curtains. Useful references: The company has presented a technical consultancy report on the impact of the VCM by Doct. Tommaso A. Dragani (annex 12) in which it is stated that the VCM release did not constitute a health hazard.\n"

        "Accident Description": "In a petrochemical plant, 60 t of off-specification ethylene was flared from 11.15 am to 5 pm following the securing of the digester of the steam-cracking unit after a lightning strike. The work carried out on one of the plant's boilers prevented removal by steam of the flaring exhaust gas; a cloud of smoke was visible from several kilometres away.The digester used nickel catalysis to convert hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) into methane (CH4) and water (H2O) at a temperature close to 230 \u00b0C. The H2 purified in this way from the CO can convert acetylene into ethylene, which is not the case when it is polluted with CO. The ethylene, which meets a relatively strict specification (5 ppm acetylene maximum) is then transformed into polyethylene.At 11.15 am on the day of the accident, a lightning strike made it necessary to secure the digester on high temperature safety; insufficient supply of H2 to hydrogenate the acetylene resulted in a high output of off-specification ethylene that had to be flared given the lack of any storage facility on the site. The unit was back in service at 12 noon, but the time required to restore the system was underestimated, leading to the production of off-specification ethylene and consequently the need to flare it until 5 pm. 2. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "Lightning (natural accident source) and organizational failure.\u200bA lightning strike made it necessary to secure the digester on high temperature safety; the decrease in H2 production, which permits hydrogenation of the acetylene, resulted in a large output of off-specification ethylene that had to be flared given the lack of any storage facility on the site. ",
        "Consequences": "Atmospheric pollution",
        "Emergency response": "Flaring",
        "Lesson Learned": "The lightning device has fulfilled its role"

        "Accident Description": "A pressurized ammonia sphere tank was taken out of operation for change of a level transmitter. The inlet valve for liquid ammonia to the sphere was closed, but ammonia was still passing through. High level alarms (High and High-High) came in, but the operators believed that the alarms were false since the sphere was closed out. This resulted in the sphere filling up completely and subsequently, liquid ammonia entered the ammonia gas system. This caused 4 episodes of ammonia releases during the period 10.07.2020 17:30 to 11.07.2020 09:30. 2 of these releases ocured relatively close to areas where people and vehicles may be present.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Direct causes: The valve that was used to close the ammonia feed to the sphere was passing ammonia in spite of being in a closed position, and several alarms on high level where not reacted to because the operator believed the alarms to be false.\nContributing factors:\n\n- Lack of understanding of the instrumentation system \u2013 that the level alarms where independent from the level indication.\n- Insufficient communication\n-Insufficient labeling of passing valves\n-Missing risk assessment for the method used to close out the ammonia sphere&nbsp;\n",
        "Consequences": "The incident led to minor consequences to the environment and no consequences to people.&nbsp;No assets/equipment were damaged.\nEconomic losses (prod. losses and cleanup) 400&nbsp;000&euro;",
        "Emergency response": "The shifts responsible for the involved equipment did not see any need to call for the emergency force. However another department called the emergency force and upon arrival there was very little ammonia gas in the area.\nA truck driver was prevented by Yara personnel to drive into an area that contained ammonia gas.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The main lessons learned from the incident was as follows; the technical standard around the system was ready for an upgrade, the competence and understanding of the operators, especially concerning important alarms needed a refresher, the communication between different parts in the organization was not optimal.\nBased on this, a technical upgrade of the system is being performed, amongst other replacement of leaking valves. Regarding competence and understanding, there is now an increased focus on strenghtening of communication lines and risk assessments.\n&nbsp;"

        "Accident Description": "A pipe cracked in reaction furnace 1 of the carbon disulphide (CS2) plant. As a result, natural gas, sulphur and carbon disulphide were burned and sulphur dioxide released.As a result, natural gas, sulphur and carbon disulphide were released at a pressure of approximately 6 bar into the furnace fired with natural gas burners and burned there. As a result of the pressure increase in reaction furnace 1, flames were emitted for a short period of time. These caused damage to wiring and also led to a shutdown of reaction furnace 2. The released substances burned up in the reaction furnace and sulphur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and small quantities of CS2 were released into the air via the reaction furnace\u2019s tall chimney. Due to wind conditions (wind direction from WNW, 1.4 m/s), the gas cloud moved towards the Rhine. Complaints were received by the fire brigade from residents on the right bank of the Rhine.Safety measures:Due to the drop in pressure in the reaction tubes, the supply of raw materials was stopped by the automatic closure of the valves. The furnace was shut down in a controlled manner under established conditions. The affected parts of the plant concerned were then rinsed.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The tubes in the reaction furnaces are subject to sulphidisation, a special form of high temperature corrosion. This cannot be avoided in this process, as past investigations have shown.The examination of this event by an expert approved under Section 29b of the \"Federal Immission Control Act\u201d (BlmSchG - Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz), and in particular the examination of the materials, has shown that the existing technical method for measuring the wall thickness of the furnace pipes and its implementation has led to misinterpretations.Technical issues: Sufficient recording of sulphidisation by a measurement method.",
        "Consequences": "Reaction furnaceCosts: &euro;465,000Odour nuisance (approx. 20 people affected) caused by a sulphurous smell or hydrogen sulphide in two districts of Cologne on the right bank of the Rhine, 6-7 km from the upstream source of emissions.",
        "Emergency response": "Controlled burning of the reaction tube contents and rinsing of the system.The small-scale localised fire was extinguished directly by the staff trained as first responders. No further fire brigade intervention was required.Outside the site, air measurements were carried out by the professional fire brigade of the city of Cologne in the districts where the odour complaints arose. The substances released could not be detected. Moreover, by the time the professional fire brigade arrived, no smell could any longer be detected.Repair of reaction furnace 1 in consultation with an expert organisation approved in accordance with Section 29a of the \"Federal Immission Control Act\u201d (BlmSchG - Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz) and the competent authority.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Precautionary replacement of reaction tubes in the other similar furnaces.A new technical procedure including a redesigned test was drawn up for measuring the wall thickness of the process tubes in the furnaces. The method has been tested to ensure that it is suitable for measuring the thickness of the wall. The test intervals and test points have been redefined. The process is being integrated into the existing management system and regularly validated as part of the management system\u2019s requirements. Staff performing wall thickness measurements are regularly trained on the implementation of the new procedure. This staff training is documented.The main purpose of improving measurement technology is to prevent incidents.Additional shut-off devices are being automated on the basis of a systematic hazard analysis.Existing agreements with the emergency services will be fleshed out."

Restart of BOG compressor. Stop of ethane release to atmosphere. Authorities informed.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "BOG compressor :\n\nThe investigation with experts indicates as root cause an overpressure of nitrogen in compressor crank case during operation leading to (excessive) oil leakage through oil packings and oil ingress into gas packing vents. Gas packing vent is connected with compressor suction, which explains oil in suction lines.\n\nFlare compressor :\n\nThe first failure of the flare compressor on 20/09/2020 (damaged impeller) is due to:\n\n1) a not visible damaged impeller during overspeed testing at the manufacturer, inducing the start of crack forming in the impeller of the flare compressor\n2) frequently operating in a certain speed range (rpm) in combination with a high process flow through the compressor inducing internal instability\n\nThe second failure on 22/09/2020 (damaged shaft and bearings) is due to:\n\n1) Operating flare compressor with a (too) high process gas flow, caused by a (too) high temperature of the process gas (-14\u00b0c instead of -88\u00b0c). This high temperature was caused by a standstill of the inlet piping during 5 days, where process gas was heated up from the environment\n2) A closed valve at the recirculation (kickback) gas flow back to the suction of the compressor",
        "Consequences": "40 tonnes of ethane was released into the atmosphere.",
        "Emergency response": "On monday 21/09/2020 the duty multi-disciplinary team was put in place. A conservative safety perimeter of 150 m around the tank (no works, no loadings) was put in place based on dispersion calculations (20 m 100% LEL). This safety perimeter remains inside establishment fences. Extra mobile gas detection put in place at ground level. Water curtains put in place around tank. Nitrogen flushing of relief valves outlet in service (reduction of ignition and freezing risks).\n&nbsp;\nOn the night of monday to tuseday 22/09/2020 the internal emergency plan level I an II (highest priority) was activated. The internal emergency crisis cell was mobilised, as well as the external emergency crisis cell. The public road next to the establishment was closed. The external fire department helped with the intervention at the tank top.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The starting procedure for the BOG compressor was not sufficiently clear which lead to errors while starting the compressor that caused the compressor to fail.&nbsp; This procedure has been updated to describe the staps more clearly. The BOG compressor has been modified to be more reliable."

For this reason the accident&nbsp; is notified.",
        "Causes of the accident": "During manoeuvring operations in the marshalling yard at about 3:40 the buffer of a platform wagon parked near a switch point hooked a rail tank wagon transporting 48 t of liquefied ammonia at 7 bar at the level of  a lateral recovery valve. The piping connected to the valve was torn by the shock to such a point that a fissure formed in the joint between the pipe and the tank causing a release of ammonia.",
        "Consequences": "The toxic cloud expanded with the wind (8 to 10 m/sec that day) reaching a distance of 700 m from the wagon, on a scarcely populated plain. 47 t of ammonia were released in the atmosphere but also in the watershed; in fact a part of the ammonia was diluted in the water curtains set up as protective measure. The transfer of the product in another tank wagon (which arrived after 8 hours) permitted the recovery of only 1 t of ammonia.  Nobody was injured in this accident.",

        "Accident Description": "At a chemical facility,&nbsp; following heavy rain (episode with a 4-year repeat frequency) the water/hydrocarbon settlement tanks overflowed into the final treatment plant and thence were released from the treatment plant's stormwater catchment pool into the environment, during 2\u00bd hours of untreated effluent charged with COD,&nbsp; hydrocarbons and benzene were directly released. Atmospheric emissions of benzene measured on- site and off-site were thus generated, causing numerous complaints from neighbours. Although measurements made by the fire brigade in the inhabited areas of Carling and L'H\u00f4pital were found to be negative (&lt;0.2 ppm), the sensors on the local air quality monitoring system measured values higher than 100 \u00b5g/m3 for 3\u00bd hours (peaking at 506 \u00b5g/m3). The quantity of effluent released from the accident is assessed at 6,000 m3 and the quantity of benzene is assessed at nearly 5 t; the quantity of dangerous substances released lie more than 5% over the threshold defined by the Seveso Directive, which is why this accident is notified.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Heavy rain (16.4 mm of water, which is a rainstorm of an intensity with a recurrence of 4 years) caused several retention systems and some water / hydrocarbon settlement tanks to spill over as their overflows could not discharge into the site's stormwater catchment tank which was already full due to heavy rainfall in the days leading up to the accident.",
        "Consequences": "The accident caused untreated water to be discharged directly into the Le Merle brook which carried excess COD (flow of 4,468 kg/d for 3,750 authorised), hydrocarbons (flow of 165 kg/d for 100 kg authorised) and benzene (flow of 84 kg/d or a concentration of 1.8 mg/l).Atmospheric emissions of benzene were also generated: measurements made by the fire brigade in inhabited areas showed a benzene concentration of less than 0.2 ppm (detection threshold) but the local air quality monitoring system between 7.15 and 10.45 a.m. measured concentrations of over 100 \u00b5g/m3 with a maximum measurement of 506 \u00b5g/m3. The nuisance caused by the smell&nbsp; resulted in 12 phone calls to the fire brigade from neighbours.",
        "Emergency response": "The floating barrage system incorporated in the water-based effluent treatment plant was deployed, enabling the hydrocarbons discharged to be limited. Hydrocarbons in the system were skimmed off and pumped for reprocessing later.\n\n\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "A survey is being conducted at the site to: - quantify waterable areas and their permeability, -&nbsp; identify the destination of water collected,- analyse the quantities of water collected in normal weather and during heavy rainfall and find out whether they are compatible with the existing holding and treatment facilities.&nbsp;"

        "Accident Description": "At around 13:40 on 9&nbsp;July 2014 (estimated time of the accident based on the fact that the first call to the fire brigade on the emergency number 115 was recorded at 13:41), two explosions took place in close succession (approximately 30 seconds between the two) inside a fireworks factory. The first explosion appears to have originated in building C. According to the information available, the plant was manufacturing fireworks to be used in displays to be put on in the surrounding area as part of local summer festivities. Another explosion (the third) took place a few minutes after the second one.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The expert witnesses appointed by the public prosecutor\u2019s office and the company to ascertain the causes and dynamics of the accident are currently performing their investigations. To enable this, the plant has been cordoned off. According to the information received from the competent rescue units of the fire brigade, \u2018based on information obtained immediately after the event, it appears that work was taking place in the area housing the hydraulic press when the explosion took place, and a van was parked in the area opposite, presumably loaded with fireworks \u2014 it was completely destroyed in the accident\u2019. According to the legal representative of the plant operator, with input from the expert witness, the explosion may have been caused by a spark generated by a discharge of electrostatic energy that had built up on a worker\u2019s clothing or on bags containing the raw materials awaiting processing in the hydraulic press area. It is argued that, given the fact that the accident took place at 13:40 in the month of July, the weather conditions (high temperature, low humidity) may have contributed to this accumulation of electrostatic energy.&nbsp; The plant\u2019s representative has also stated that the surveillance footage from within the establishment shows that the first explosion took place in building C (workshop and hydraulic press) and that burning fragments (from finished fireworks present in the area) were launched in the direction of the other buildings reachable in a straight line from building C, causing a domino effect. The roofs of the affected buildings, which, in accordance with applicable legislation, had been designed to channel the force of the blast upwards in the event of an explosion inside, would not have been capable of protecting the products within those buildings from the impact of those burning fragments. The role, if any, of the van found destroyed in the area facing building C (figures 4 and 5 in the Confidential section) remains unclear, though it is \u2018very likely that it was directly affected by the explosion, since it marked one of the points of the crater and had been completely blown apart by the blast\u2019 (fire brigade report of 10&nbsp;July 2014).",
        "Consequences": "The explosion virtually destroyed the entire plant, except for buildings I, E and TPF, which were damaged to a lesser extent (see figure 6). Three people were taken to hospital with burns and injuries of varying severity; two were discharged on the same day and were expected to recover soon afterwards and the third was admitted to hospital with second-degree burns and fractures, although his condition was not considered to be life-threatening. Another three employees were found dead at the scene: one was found between buildings I (canopy-covered structure) and D (compound warehouse), while the other two victims were found under the rubble of building C (the workshop and hydraulic press). The shell of a van, completely destroyed and with evidence that an explosion had taken place inside it, was found in the area opposite building C (workshop and hydraulic press). Other vehicles used to transport raw materials and products around the plant were also found damaged in different parts of the plant. Fragments (concrete fragments and unexploded devices) were found across a radius of approximately 500&nbsp;m. The projection of incendiary fragments after the explosion caused fires to start in the scrubland surrounding the plant (figures 7 and 8). The explosion was felt beyond the plant&rsquo;s immediate surroundings, as far as homes in the nearest urban centres.&nbsp;",
        "Emergency response": "The competent local fire brigade, ambulance service, carabinieri, municipal police, National Forestry Corps, military explosives experts and the main local authorities (regional and municipal authorities, Prefecture and prosecution service) got involved immediately. Given the nature and timing of the event, it would not have been feasible to manage the emergency internally. Local people who saw and felt the effects of the explosions called the fire brigade to report the accident and firefighters were promptly dispatched. The intervention basically consisted of searching for missing persons and putting out fires in vehicles and scrubland both on and off the plant premises, taking the necessary precautions given that unexploded fireworks were present. Once notified of the accident, the competent authority activated its External Emergency Plan.&nbsp; As part of the activities carried out under this plan, inter-institutional meetings were held for a joint assessment of the event and to decide on further steps to be taken. Staff from the Prefecture took part in these meetings.&nbsp;\nAt a dedicated meeting held on 10&nbsp;July 2014 at the offices of the local authority, it was decided, in view of an assessment of the situation, that none of the additional measures possible under the External Emergency Plan would need to be activated, so the emergency was declared over. However, as agreed at a subsequent meeting, supervision and clean-up work continued in the area.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In the report entitled Risk assessment report: major accident risks and the consequences of major accidents (August 2010), the plant operator concluded that a hypothetical explosion in building B or G would be fatal (0.14&nbsp;bar) at a distance of up to 173&nbsp;m, cause irreversible injuries (0.07&nbsp;bar) up to 281&nbsp;m and cause reversible injuries (0.03&nbsp;bar) up to&nbsp;533 m. The owner of the fireworks business is under investigation for multiple counts of manslaughter and criminal negligence resulting in a major accident. The plant area was ordered to be cordoned off. The plant\u2019s safety management system was audited in 2012, revealing major technical and management weaknesses with regard to safety issues. These weaknesses, with specific reference to health and safety for the protection of workers, were also highlighted by the local health authority following its inspection of safety conditions at the business.\nThe proceedings are ongoing and the expert witnesses appointed by the parties have not yet submitted their reports."

A call for help was received at 03:07 by the centre of alert transmission of Tours and it was re-trasmitted to the centres of Chateau-Renault and Amboise. At 03:20 a fire fighting vehicle from Chateau-Renault arrived on-site. Since the accident led to the rupture of three fire hydrants, two lances were installed taking water from the Brenne river, 500 metres away. At 03:40 the fire fighting vehicle from Amboise arrived and at 04:06 4 lances were in operation. Meanwhile, the fire covered a surface of about 2,000-3,000 m2. At 05:52 two foam guns arrived from Tours and, when at 06:15, 2 foam tankers arrived on-site, they were put in operation with positive effects due to the synthetic foam used. Owing to the formation of a toxic cloud inside the building, at about 05:00 the Mayor of Chateau-Renault decided to evacuate a building where 200 handicapped people were housed. From 05:00 to 08:30 analyses of the cloud composition have been performed every half an hour. Those analyses revealed the presence of hydrogen cyanide, carbon oxide, nitrogen oxides and halogens. At 08:30 the analysis revealed only some traces of carbon oxide. There was the risk of intoxication for the rescuers (because they had no suitable personnel protection equipment) and also a risk of explosion of nearby reactors and vessels. The water used to cool these vessels and to extinguish the fire (500-600m3/h) caused the pollution of the Brenne river crossing the site. A dike was built a few hours after the fire started to prevent discharge of used fire fighting water to this river. Despite these measures, phenols were found in Loire river fed by the Brenne river. The authorities decided to interrupt (for three days) the distribution of drinking water to 200,000 people. Drinking water needs were estimated to be 45,000m3/day and were covered by various sources (interconnection with water networks of nearby communities, the use of water sources not affected by the pollution, the use of deep wells, extended the use of bottled mineral water and the use of two trains of 3,000 m3 capacity each).",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nDuring the process in which an emulsion of oil and water was prepared with the addition of various oxyethylenic tensioactives, a wrong mixing operation was performed in a reactor of area Z9 causing a release of hydrogen, and perhaps also sodium hydride, due to a wrong pH control (this reaction, when was experimentally performed in a laboratory, caused a deflagration) that resulted in an explosion.

Personnel working in the immediate vicinity attempted to extinguish the fire but quickly realised that aerosol containers were beginning to fail and evacuated the building. The fire was contained in Warehouse 9, although there were some road closures. The main heat of the fire declined by late evening but was not finally extinguished until Monday 7th November. No-one was hurt during the incident and no offsite injuries or health effects have been reported. There were environmental consequences due to surfactant contamination of the River Skerne causing foaming and minor fish death, insufficient in scale to constitute a major accident to the environment. However, it is clear that some organic material was also released to ground during the incident.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Not possible to confirm due to substantial fire damage however most likely explanation for the fire (by elimination of other causes) was a collision from an electrical powered fork truck with a pallet of aerosols. It is likely this involved a FLT reversing into the pallet, although the FLT driver may not have been aware of this due to the size of the truck, which along with the other FLTs operated in relatively narrow aisles. The collision would release LPG vapour which was then ignited, with the FLT potentially acting as a source of ignition. The FLT was not specifically designed for use in hazardous / zoned areas reflecting the fact that the warehouse had not been established as a zoned area. The fire was discovered by a fork truck operator.\nOrganisational:\nThe potential risk of operating relatively large FLTs within narrow aisles had not been recognised.\nHuman:\nNot possible to confirm however the most likely explanation of the fire is a FLT driver reversing into a pallet of aerosols causing damage and a release of LPG vapour which was subsequently ignited. Owing to the size of the FLT it could be possible for the FLT driver not to be aware of the damage caused.\n&nbsp;",

        "Emergency response": "Full emergency response.&nbsp;On site and off site plans invoked.",
        "Lesson Learned": "No direct lessons learned by the operator who has withdrawn from warehousing aerosols. They had previously conducted a gap analysis against the accepted industry guidance on the storage of aerosols in warehouses and found themselves broadly compliant. Whilst further risk reduction measures had been identified including caging of aerosols and fitting of a deluge system they had been rejected following a cost benefit analysis. They had however decided to replace their FLTs with ones rated for use in a zoned area when the time came to renew their FLT fleet, which had been planned for a future date. The speed with which the incident escalated was not previously foreseen which highlighted the importance to consider additional control measures in any situation where rapid escape may be difficult e.g. working in raised platforms, scissor lifts, man aloft FLTs etc. This is now reflected in the associated trade industry guidance."

It has not yet been possible to determine the origin and exact location of the fire. A judicial investigation and an administrative inquiry are still under way to determine, in particular, where the fire started: whether at the Seveso site or at a neighbouring storage company. Two neighbouring industrial sites suffered damage (a waste treatment plant and a warehousing company). A total of 9,511 tonnes of products were burned in the fire (5,253 tonnes of products on the Seveso site and 4,258 tonnes in neighbouring warehouses). A significant plume of smoke outside the site (22 km long and 6 km wide) travelled as far as the Rouen city centre, the north of France and was observed in Belgium and the Netherlands. Local residents experienced a nauseating stench, with some of them reporting throat irritation, a headaches and vomiting. The operator was unable to contain all of the extinguishing water and combustion products, part of which ended up in the River Seine, despite the installation of floating barriers.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The starting point and origin of the fire are not yet known. A judicial investigation and an administrative inquiry are under way.",
        "Consequences": "There were no deaths or direct injuries. It was not possible to contain all of the extinguishing water on the site. The floating barriers placed in the canal adjacent to the River Seine limited the pollution to a great extent (supernatant surface of approximately 2,000 m&sup2;). A plume of black fumes 22 km long and 6 km wide, led to ash falling at distances of more than 100 km along with strong odours. During the first two days, 237 schools in 12 municipalities downwind of the establishment were closed and there were 254 hospital emergency presentations and 9 hospital admissions linked to the fire, though no-one was seriously injured. Restrictions were imposed on the consumption of agricultural products from 215 municipalities and lifted in full on 18 October.Starting on the morning when the fire broke out, samples (air, ash/deposits) were taken by the fire brigade, the approved observatory for air-quality monitoring and information and private laboratories designated by the State. The samples were supplemented by analyses of the various matrices (air, surface water, supply of drinking water, soil and vegetation, food matrices) to ensure their compatibility with current and medium-term use. The results at this stage do not reveal any contraindications with regard to the uses analysed.",
        "Emergency response": "The fire brigade was alerted by a third-party company that noticed flames in the direction of the two sites. The fire grew very quickly. In order to avoid secondary incidents, the Seveso establishment staff, with the help of the fire brigade, removed containers of phosphorus pentasulphide (a flammable product, reacting violently with water, generating hydrogen sulphide and phosphoric acid) to a safe distance. As the situation progressed, large bulk containers stored outdoors started melting and firemen had to deal with the release of liquid fuels. After 2 hours of use, the site\u2019s fire water reservoir (1,860 m\u00b3) was empty. It took 5 hours to arrange for water to be pumped directly from the River Seine. The prefect of the department triggered the special intervention plan at around 5.30 a.m. and ordered the confinement of an area within a 500-metre perimeter. The fire, which spread over approximately 3.7 hectares, was brought under control after an intervention of 13 hours.

Production requires, inter alia, hydrazine hydrate with 64% hydrazine as input.At 19.45, shortly after starting the pump pumping the hydrazine hydrate from the storage tank to the receiver tank, hydrazine hydrate escaped from a leaking flange on a +5 m platform of the production building.The hydrazine hydrate flowed through the platform drainage into building\u2019s waste water pit.\nSafety measure:As the start of the process was supervised from the control room and by an on-site staff member, the leak was noticed immediately and the pump stopped. As a further immediate measure, the valve to a neighbouring container was fully opened. As a result, the pressure in the pipe was lowered and the leak flow significantly reduced. The leakage ended when the pipe ran empty, approximately eight minutes after the pump was switched on. Another container was freed up so that approximately 100 kg could be diverted into that container.The quantity released could thus be limited to approximately 680 kg of hydrazine hydrate.",

        "Emergency response": "The liquid accumulated in the open wastewater pit, consisting of the spray and cleaning water already present in the pit and the liquid that had leaked, was pumped into an empty, enclosed wastewater tank and retained there.To remove the leaked hydrazine, the building\u2019s platform and drainage pipe were rinsed with water. This rinsing water was also discharged into the tank via the waste water pit and retained.Sodium hypochlorite (chlorine bleach solution) was added to the waste water tank to destroy the hydrazine. The hydrazine was thus oxidised to nitrogen and the chlorine contained in the sodium hypochlorite was converted into chloride.By the time the maximum fill level was reached, we were able to reduce the hydrazine concentration to about 0.5%. The analyses show that there are no other substances above the authorised concentrations or loads. The water containing approximately 0.5% hydrazine was transferred to a total of two tank-containers pending a decision on its continued use.",

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:\nAn inexperienced new operator (17 years old) had to mix 2 chemicals for the first time. He got a prescription of the proceedings but he was not under supervision. By unacquaintance of chemicals and their names, he took by mistake sulphuric acid instead of sodium sulphate. An exothermic chemical reaction, which could not be stopped, occurred resulting in the release of chlorine and hydrogen chloride into the building and, then, into the environment (the building was well vented). The operator, as soon as he detected an abnormal amount of smoke that was developping from the mixer, stopped it and pressed the alarm. The local fire brigade started to cool the mixer until the unwanted reaction stopped. The local fire-brigade also measured the concentrations of chlorine and hydrogen chloride inside the building. No action to alert the population was carried out because the measured concentrations inside the building did not exceed several times the MAC-values of chlorine (1.5 mg/m3) and hydrogen chloride (7 mg/m3). The dimensions of the cloud outside the building are not known. Toxic effects (irritation) in the neighbourhood were limited within a distance of 100 metres. Unfortunately, the toxic fumes were sucked in by the ventilation system of a nearby factory. As a consequence, 29 employees of this neighbouring company were intoxicated. 30 people were referred to a hospital: 1 operator from Biesterfeld &amp; Co and 29 employees of this neighbouring company.

        "Consequences": "EFFECTS ON PEOPLE:1 operator of Biesterfield &amp; Co was hospitalized due to intoxication caused by the toxic cloud of chlorine and hydrogen chloride.Since the concentrations of toxic substances measured inside the building did not exceeded several times the MAC-values for chlorine and hydrogen chloride (toxic effects [irritation] were limited within a distance of 100 metres), no action to alert the population was carried out. Unlucky, the released toxic fumes were sucked in by the ventilation system of a nearby factory and, as a consequence, 29 employees of this neighbouring company were referred to a hospital together with the intoxicated operator of Biesterfeld &amp; Co. After examination, 12 people were taken in for observation and 18 were sent home.MATERIAL LOSS:No data are available about the cost of the pollution in the mixing room where the accident occurred.Disruption of community life: The local fire brigade measured the gas concentration inside the building but no action was carried out to alert the population because it did not exceeded several times times the MAC-values of chlorine (1.5 mg/m3) and hydrogen chloride (7 mg/m3). The toxic effects were limited within 100 metres but, unfortunately, the toxic fumes were sucked in by the ventilation system of a nearby factory and 29 employees of this company were referred to the hospital due to intoxication.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",

        "Accident Description": "In the hydro-cracker plant during repair works on a pressure pipe a mechanical failure occurred. During milling of apertures in the piping, the encircling enclosure that is a gas sealing joint which should guarantee to the atmosphere was milled too. The works on the pipe had the task to interrupt it before the radiator to put it out service for repair. These borings and lockings of under pressure tubes are called HOT-TAPPING and are executed by specialised companies. By milling of the security enclosure and by these apertures the pressure released from this part of the plant through the pentane columns, air-cooler reflown vessel and the involved piping system. During this action  the hydrocarbons (C1-C5) and H2S escaped, in total a quantity of 14.45 kg. For a  sulphur content of 1.5 ma% in the hydro-cracker unit in the quantity which was gone out 1.385 kg H2S. By the outlet three collaborators of external companies which made the works were injured,  one of them fatally. Immediately after the gas escape the plant was shut down. The application of the plant fire brigade prevented a larger distribution of the gas cloud. The neighbourhood was not in danger.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The testing of the employed bore-machine showed that the cause of the perturbance was the discordance between the actual advance value and the advance value indication. The bore movement was exactly the double the required and displayed. By this the fitting was destroyed. It is presumed that the false indication is a consequence of a construction error which was from the beginning in the bore-machine and was not observed.",

The crane operator had trouble lifting the dismounted equipment he was handling and increased the lifting power. This caused the gangway to become abruptly disconnected and to sway, so that it collided with the valves.",
        "Causes of the accident": "While replacing a metal gangway straddling four horizontal storage tanks, the crane operator caused a collision with the valves of three of the cylinders. The crane operator had trouble lifting the dismounted equipment he was handling and increased the lifting tension. This caused the gangway to become abruptly disconnected and to sway, so that it collided with the valves. During the process the crane operator, a subcontractor of the outside company handling the work, was guided by two people.",
        "Consequences": "No victims. 12 tonnes of propane were released into the atmosphere.",
        "Emergency response": "The site was secured and the automatic sprinkler system was activated. The internal operating plan was launched at 9:45; the rescue services were alerted and gas detection measures reinforced. A security perimeter was established and three neighbouring buildings occupied by members of the police force and their families (150 people) were evacuated. Traffic on the N193 was interrupted, which affected access to the airport and caused disturbances for 50% of passengers at boarding. Firemen regularly measure the amount of combustible and explosive gases at and outside the site. The liquid phases of LPG are emptied by fire trucks and removed by clients. LPG is transferred between the storage tanks in question gradually as the valves of each tank are replaced after they have been put under atmospheric pressure. As valves needed to be delivered for the repair of the third tank, it was taken out of service. During the emptying phase, the walls of the retention troughs and the related compressed air networks broke under pressure from the water accumulated during the sprinkling of the tanks; when the bleed valves lost their air supply, they closed automatically and consequently the transfer of propane was stopped until the personnel could restore the network. Road traffic was re-established at 21:30 once the situation was under control. The internal operating plan was lifted at 5:30 the next morning and the rescue services finished their work at 6:30. On 25 May, a specialised company carried out non-destructive testing on the tanks to verify that there were no cracks.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The operator will examine which work procedures need to be implemented or changed (permit for crane work, working at heights, etc.). It plans to carry out the work on tanks filled up to the minimum level and to perform manual operations, if necessary.\nWhile the rescue services were at work, the motor of one of the two seawater pumps supplying the fire fighters overheated after being used non-stop for 18 hours and due to blockage of some of the suction strainers. Despite a loss of efficiency, the water supply to the fire main remained sufficient. The freshwater pump was used as a backup. During the emptying phase, the walls of the retention troughs and the related compressed air networks broke under pressure from the water accumulated during the sprinkling of the tanks; when the bleed valves lost their air supply, they closed automatically and consequently the transfer of propane was stopped until the personnel could restore the network."

        "Accident Description": "Fire in a dye synthesis plant",
        "Causes of the accident": "Incrustations of p-NA built-up in the upper part of the reactor, particularly in correspondence with the steam injection pipe. Moreover, certain amounts of dry p-NA penetrated into the suction pipe and formed deposits inside it. Consequent to the formation of NO2 during diazotation, the incrustations on the steam pipe and in the exhaust system were transformed into a more reactive product.\nTests have shown that exposing solidified p-NA surfaces (having a  similar consistency of p-NA incrustations) to NO2 gas, leads to the formation of an extremely reactive product.\nOn 11/05/00 a fire occurred in a dyes synthesis plant.In the plant in question, p-nitroaniline (p-NA) is diazotated. The diazotation reaction occurs in an iced hydrous solution, sodium nitrite (in hydrous solution) and hydrochloric acid (34%) are used as diazotation agents. During the diazotation reaction, nitrous gases are released and sent, together with the hydrochloric acid vapours, to the alkaline absorption through a piping system.During the start-up operations of the apparatus for a new synthesis process, an empty container (18,5 m3)&nbsp; had to be cleaned with pre-heated water added with a sodium hydroxide solution (approx. 200 l).After filling the container to approximately 2/3 of its volume, low pressure vapour was blown into the container by opening a manual valve. The steam is fed through a pipe directly into the cleaning solution. The liquid phase as well as the pipe-walls which are not covered by the liquid heat up, temperatures expected are around 100\u00b0C.A few minutes after&nbsp; the steam feeding started, the operator observed the appearance of a flame which moved towards the suction opening. Shortly afterwards (a few minutes), flames accompanied by detonating sounds appeared in the suction pipe. Immediately after, the suction pipe completely burnt with a flash-like fire.&nbsp; The operator declared, moreover, that during diazotation reaction large amounts of nitric oxides are released and that during the last 10 start-ups large amounts of dust occurred during dosage because of the use of dry p-NA. Dust was aspirated and penetrated into the suction system.",
        "Consequences": "1.000.000 EURO material damage",

        "Lesson Learned": "Pimary measures:Exhaust air system: Prevent the formation of dust by using moist anilins. Installation of separate exhaust systems in order to avoid the contact between deposits and NOx. Continuous monitoring and cleaning. Installation of spraying nozzles at the socket of the suction pipe for dust abatement. Inhibition of the deposit reactivity by moistening/washing.Diazotation reactor: prevent the formation of deposits/incrustations by flushing of the reactor wall and the reactor internals.Secondary measures:Exhaust air system: Signal/detect exothermic reactions by installing temperature-sensors in critical areas. Flooding of the piping system at a threshold temperature by means of an automatic/manual release. Prevent exhaust air ventilators from being potential ignition sources (avoid spark formation, arrange driving motors outside the exhaust air system).Diazotation reactor: Prevent heating of surfaces by temperature-monitoring of the shaft of the stirrer; insert the steam pipe horizontally under the surface of the liquid; use a double walled pipe as steam pipe .Unequivocal and restrictive regulations concerning maintenance-, cleaning- and other operations.Tertiary measures:The following measures are intended to avoid/limit the fire&nbsp; propagation in the suction system:- internal extinguishing system automatically activarted by&nbsp; a temperature sensor- linked to an automatic fan switch-off- use ofcertified&nbsp; inflammable or fire resistant materials for the piping and the adsorber equipment- use of automatically closing fire dampers- installation of the vertical exhaust air duct on the external wall of the building (exhaust air ducts should not pass through firewalls)- installation of spray nozzles in vertical pipes - consider eventual waterloads in structural calculations"

        "Finish Date": "2010-09-21 08:15:00",
        "Accident Description": "30 litres of water were to be introduced in the prescribed manner from a container into a reactor (in a manual controlled addition, depending on the reactor temperature) as part of a plant operator's control routine. Two shut-off valves (one metering valve and one pneumatic shut-off valve) must be closed before the water is added. The plant operator then opens the pneumatic shut-off valve using a process control system (PCS) and the water is added via the metering valve. The operator forgot to check if the metering valve was closed, so after the pneumatic valve was opened the full 30 l of water was released into the reactor, triggering a reaction, releasing hydrogen chloride and causing the reaction product to foam up. The gas-liquid mixture from the reactor escaping quickly through the exhaust pipes to the absorber increased the pressure in the reactor to at least 0.5 bar. This pressure surge resulted in the cooling coils breaking off two of the three vapour coolers. The hydrogen chloride/product mixture continuing to rise up from the reactor was thus able to penetrate through the cooling coils into the coolant pipe system and then escape through the pressure compensation tank opening into the building.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause of the release of the hydrogen chloride was excessive water metering in a reactor vessel (30 litres in one go, as opposed to in 3 litre increments), which led to an uncontrolled exothermic chemical reaction. A glass cooler broke in the process and product leaked out via the cooling circuit. The bursting disc (set pressure 0.8 bar) was not damaged.\nIn addition to the operating error, an assessment confirmed the rupture of the cooling coils resulted from the pressure increase caused by the rapidly rising gas/liquid mixture.\n",
        "Consequences": "Cleaning and repair of the facility, removal cost, loss of raw materials, costs for fire brigade and police.\n7 people outside the operating area were injured.\n",
        "Emergency response": "The safety devices reacted in accordance with their intended functions. The bursting disc of the reactor (set pressure 0.8 bar) was, however, undamaged. As it was not contaminated, the pressure must have remained in the reactor 0.5 < p < 0.8 bar, before the cooling coil broke. The pneumatic stop valve of the water addition was closed automatically by the detected increase of pressure (with p > 0.2 bar). The fire brigade was automatically alerted and took further action in conjunction with the police. The plant management and the company management were notified via the emergency and incident management system, as were the other people flagged for notification in the system. On-site:\nSealing off and evacuation of the premises.\nFresh air from outside was used to dispel the polluted indoor air until the smell of hydrogen chloride in the building was very faint. Until that point, gas masks had to be worn by those entering the area.\nThe fire brigade sprayed the building with water to condense any remaining\nhydrogen chloride gas or hydrochloric acid vapour.\nThe resulting precipitation in the operating area was\ncollected in a chemical catch basin and was channelled into the public sewage system after pH tests.\nRestoration:\nResidue from the reaction product had to be removed from the entire facility and the facility inspected for damage. Damaged parts were then replaced. Off-site:\n-\tSurrounding roads sealed off.\n-\tOrder to keep doors and windows in the surrounding area closed (including radio announcements).\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Revision of the PAAG (hazard and operability study) concerning this process to take particular account of operating errors and balanced measures.\nThe PAAG revealed that the process for adding water must be technically restructured such that the maximum quantity that can be added at one time is limited to 3 litres. This happens through a second glass vessel with a maximum volume of 3 litres situated between the initial glass vessel and the exhaust pipes. Likewise, the shut-off valve to the reactor and the shut-off valve to the initial glass vessel are connected to each other, so that only one of them can be open at any one time. The buttons for operating these two valves are installed within sight of the valves so that permanent visual control by operators is ensured. This also limits the maximum amount that can be added to 3 litres and prevents recurrence of this operating error.\nThe operator carrying out the task must ensure, before the addition of water commences, that the dispensing valve is closed. This check must be consciously performed and documented from now on.\nThe PAAGs of other chemical reactions will be examined for potential operating errors. Findings from the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Office for the Environment, Land Surveys and Nature Protection:\nOne of the main lessons from this incident is that there must be a balanced relationship between recognised danger points and the measures selected to manage them. In the event of a potential loss of control over the reaction process, only inherently secure process configurations or protection through PCE devices should be selected. When designing PCE devices, the reliability and inertia of the entire system must be taken into account. Coupling of the room ventilation system to the fire alarm system.\nReview of the information procedure for notifying the affected neighbourhood \u2013 completing the list of contacts, and optimisation of the telephone notification chain.\n"

At 18:10 the ship's responsible mechanic requested a halt in the loading in order to proceed with necessary repairs. 20 minutes after the interruption, a strong explosion occurred in the ship machinery shop, followed by a fire. Immediately the refinery fire alarm was activated and the refinery fire-fighting crew reached the fire area in a couple of minutes. 4 injured members of the ship's crew were carried out to the pier and from there to the nearest hospital. The fire fighting operation started with the local monitors covering with foam the outside part of the ship and the machinery shop. Meanwhile the ship was disconnected from the loading hoses (spouders) and from the tied ropes and, by means of two tags, transferred away from the pier. The fire fighting activities were undertaken by the Navy Guarding Services using special fire fighting tags (water foam). Finally, the burning ship was transferred at about 1.5 km away from the pier installation and six hours later the fire was under control. Meanwhile, the Navy Guarding Services were connected with fire fighting crews from the Special National Fire Fighting Services. However, the next morning the fire, from the machinery shop, reached the first tank and spread, with repeated explosions, to the other tanks of the ship. At noon of the day after, the situation appeared to be out of control. Four firemen were injured. The ship was bent and the fire was extending from leaking gasoline 50 m around. Navigation in the gulf was interrupted and fire fighters tried to the fire from spreading to the other anchored ships. They tried to avoid environmental pollution by using a 400 metres long boom. On Saturday afternoon, about 48 hours after the first explosion, the tanker sank.",

Meanwhile the ship was disconnected from the loading hoses (spouders) and from the tied ropes and, by means of two tags, transferred away from the pier.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The special forces from the National Fire Fighting Services came to support the fire fighting efforts close to the pier and later with tags in the open sea. The ship was disconnected from the loading hoses and moved away from the pier (the fire did not spread to the refinery loading installations) in order to put out the fire without its spreading to the other anchored ships.&nbsp; Navigation in the gulf was interrupted and no other ships were allowed to enter the sea Gulf. The environmental pollution was avoided by using a 400 metres long boom around the burning ship.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- the upgrading of the refinery pier fire fighting systems (including the installation of new automatic remote control monitors on local towers) is ready for application;\n2- the crew of ships and especially tankers must be well trained in fire prevention.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, the following measures were established:\nAfter the accident, the following measures were established:\n1- the crew of ships and especially tankers must be well trained in fire fighting;\n2- the fire fighting means for this type of tankers must be improved and they must be in a sufficient number both on the deck and in the other special areas of the ships;\n3- the fire fighting tugs must be equipped with large quantities of a foam compound."

        "Accident Title": "Release of LPG (no fire nor explosion) during the dismantling operations of asafety relief valves for test",
        "Start Date": "2001-09-17 11:25:00",
        "Finish Date": "2001-10-17 15:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Release of LPG in gas phase from the connection pipe to one of two safety valves installed on storage tank no. 1 in the tank park. Each tank is equipped with a safety valve assembly made of two safety relief valves installed on a slide valve to allow the regular testing of the safety valve efficiency by excluding one of the two safety valves from the circuit, allowing the provisional dismantling of the safety valves one at a time.At about 11 am, after having turned the shaft of the slide valve in such a way as to exclude the valve which was to be dismantled, a maintenance worker started to unscrew the valve; at a certain point during the loosening of the connection the valve and the drainage pipe to which it was connected were projected into the air and the violent release of LPG in gas phase from the tank started.The release continued without any other associated occurrence until the off-site fire brigade reached the premises and interrupted the release by sealing the valve socket.According to the safety manger of the company approximately 12.5 tons of LPG were released during the occurrence: this amount is above the 5% threshold foreseen for the substance involved in column 3 of Annex I of the Seveso II Directive (200 t).",
        "Causes of the accident": "The installation was sealed off by the locally competent judicial authority and subsequently a technical investigation was carried out by the Vicenza fire brigade on the safety valve assembly involved in the accident. The investigation showed that the washer, the separating metal plate with the relative gaskets and the sealing bolt of the gasket were missing on this valve assembly. All the missing parts except the bolt were later found inside the tank when it was inspected after cleaning operations; it is likely that the bolt was thrown out into the air.According to the design, in normal working of the valve assembly the central position of the gasket connects the tank with both safety valves, whereas by changing the position of the gasket towards one of the safety valve connections that valve can be dismantled and serviced.&nbsp; In the specific case, the missing gasket prevented the closing of the connection with the safety relief valve, causing the release of LPG and the ejection of the safety relief valve which was being dismantled by the worker during the scheduled periodic calibration. It is therefore assumed that a defect occurred in the slide valve due to a defective tightening of the bolt holding the sealing gasket.The initiating cause of the accident was probably the sealing gasket in the slide valve of the safety valve assembly slipping out of its seat and preventing the sealing of the valve seat opening of the safety valve which was being dismantled.However, the worker who was present at the accident stated that the gas detection device of the slide valve, consisting in a vent-hole, did not indicate detection of the presence of gas, which would have prevented him, according to the safety procedures, from dismantling the safety valve. ",
        "Consequences": "The accident caused damage to the safety devices of the tank and the loss of 12.5 tons of LPG. The tank was sealed off for a short period of time by the competent judicial authorities.No effects on man or the environmentMaterial Loss:The costs indicated refer to: the value of the product released, the loss caused by the shut down of the installation ordered by the judicial authority and the substitution of the safety devices: the emergency response operation of the fire brigade is not taken into account as it is free of charge.Consequences - Discussion:Nevertheless, it has to be considered that in the case of ignition a jet fire could have occurred. The estimated effects were calculated using mathematical models available on the market (SIGEM, STAR and ministerial decree of the Environment Ministry DMA 15.5.96), reaching in the worst-case values of 12 kw/m2 up to a radius of 15 m approx. (lethal threshold indicated in the relevant literature), with easily foreseeable consequences for the worker.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "When the accident occurred the operator was dismantling the safety relief valve to be calibrated. When he noticed the release of LPG he immediately alerted the storage house manager who activated the procedures foreseen by the onsite emergency plan (securing the installation by activating the shut-off valves on the pipes and the tanks constituting the tank park and starting the transfer of the LPG from the leaking tank into another partially empty tank).After a call from the company and also from the neighbouring population, first the fire brigade of Bassano del Grappa and then the fire brigade of Vicenza intervened and stopped the leak by sealing the valve seat of the safety relief valve which had been ejected by means of a threaded blind plug.For safety reasons the traffic on the road passing near the establishment (express way SS248 Gasparona was closed) throughout the occurrence (from approximately 11:25 hrs to 15:00 hrs).Official action taken - legal action: Immediately after the accident the Attorney General of Bassano del Grappa ordered the sealing off of tank no. 1 and equipment involved in the accident. The competent judicial authorities started criminal proceedings which were concluded in June 2002.Official action taken - other official action: The Regional Technical Committee  (CTR ) discussed the technical report presented by the fire brigade commander of Vicenza taking note of the accident causes, which successively led the company to present a new safety report.Seveso II duties  - remarks: When the accident occurred a\ncomplete safety management system had not been implemented. Only after\nthe accident was the Safety Management System completely implemented\nand verified with an inspection in February 2002.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons: Considering the\nresults of the technical investigation performed by the fire brigade on\nthe safety valve assembly, the company decided to substitute the valve\nassembly concerned in the accident and all the other similar valve\nassemblies on the other 6 tanks.\nThe competent inspection authority (ISPESL) also imposed the\ninstallation on the pipe connecting the valve assembly and the tank, of\nan additional shut-off ball valve with a seal applied on the all-open\nposition.\nThis measure was agreed upon with the competent regional control\nauthority. Measures to prevent recurrence: All safety valve assemblies were substituted and between each assembly and tank an additional valve with seal was installed, as described before, in order to be able to shut-off possible accidental releases. Measures to mitigate consequences: As a containment measure for accidental releases the installation of a water barrier is foreseen around LPG tanks.Useful references: The study of the accident was presented at the 2002 Risk Evaluation and Management Conference (VCR 2002) held in Pisa, with the title \"Analisi di un incidente - Rilascio di GPL gas\" by the authors F.

        "Accident Description": "An employee wanted to clear a blocked pipe between a container and a pump (filter press). He closed the ball valve on the container (holding 15,000&nbsp;litres) and opened the pipe before the pump.\nIt became apparent that the valve was not completely closed, so when the pipe was unblocked the raw zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) solution was released from the container.\nAs the valve could no longer be sealed, the employee opened the drain valve of the container and emptied it into the collecting tray.\nSafety measures:\nA large proportion of the solution was transferred to the collecting tray.\nHowever, part of the solution ran into the raw materials hall via the open pipeline before the pump. Despite the plant\u2019s containment measures, approximately 500 l passed through the western gate into an open space in front of the hall. From there it passed via the plant\u2019s drain system into a six-chamber tank.\nAll nearby drain inlets were immediately sealed with drain covers. However, one drain inlet was blocked by a pallet.\nWhen this was discovered, the outlet of the six-chamber tank was immediately sealed off from the sewer system (22:45). The possibility cannot be ruled out that waste water contaminated with zinc (Zn) entered into the public sewer network via the six-chamber tank.\nThe operator\u2019s estimation is approximately 50&nbsp;litres of raw solution.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause was a hand valve on the container that was not completely closed.\nAt the time of the incident, pallets had been placed on the drain inlet outside the raw materials hall (west side). The inlet was therefore not sealed in time. The surrounding drains were all sealed with drain covers.",
        "Consequences": "Cleaning costs approx. EUR&nbsp;5,000.",
        "Emergency response": "Binding agent to contain the solution, covering of drains, closure of the valve to the discharge point.\nCleaning of the drains and the six-chamber tank.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The following measures are the result of an expert opinion issued in accordance with Section 29b of the Federal Immission Control Act. They have been approved by the D\u00fcsseldorf Regional Government.\nMeasure 1:The newly installed ball valve must be included in the zinc sulfate installation\u2019s testing plan. Testing must cover at least the functionality of the measurement and control equipment (position feedback) and the leakproofness and mobility of the ball valve (due to interference from sediments).The testing cycle will initially be set at 1 year.\nMeasure 2:The ball valve position feedback must be shown in the P&amp;I diagram. Until the next revision of the P&amp;I diagram, a redline revision in the master copy will suffice.\nMeasure 3:The procedural instructions \u2018Production and purification of raw zinc sulfate solution\u2019 must be extended to include a passage describing the procedure for purging a blockage in the pipe from the container to the filter press. It should at least describe how to purge the blockage and what to do if a simple purging does not work. Training must be given on what to do in the event of a fault, and evidence of this training must be documented.\nMeasure 4:The opening of pipelines containing hazardous substances must be described in separate procedural instructions. Training must be given on this, and evidence of this training must be documented.\nMeasure 5:The operator must demonstrate that, even if the entire contents of the container is discharged, no other substances stored in the wettable area that have material incompatibilities with the raw material solution (e.g. zinc dust, reactive sludges) make their way into the raw material solution. This proof can be provided by a member of staff with comprehensive knowledge of the subject matter (demonstrated by relevant university studies) by 1 October 2019.\nMeasure 6:The floor in the raw materials hall is not sufficiently resistant to raw material solutions. The area beneath the pump is not currently visible, as the pump operates in an elevated position. As a high-performance forced conveyor, vibrations in this area cannot be ruled out during the pump\u2019s operation. It is therefore necessary to check whether the floor beneath the pump has been damaged by the incident in such a way that it can no longer be guaranteed with sufficient certainty that the pump is mounted securely.\nMeasure 7:During the incident, some of the raw material solution was able to flow freely through the rear hall gate into the yard. Following the incident, in order to prevent the yard\u2019s asphalt surface from being contaminated by raw material solution from the container again, the operator added a raised edge, in the form of a threshold, to the floor at the rear gate in order to increase the retention volume of the raw materials hall. The threshold is exposed to mechanical loads due to site traffic (forklift trucks). The threshold must undergo regular visual inspection to check for damage. The proposed interval for these inspections is monthly. This inspection must be included in the zinc sulfate installation\u2019s testing plan.\nMeasure 8:At the time of the incident, pallets bearing sales goods had been placed in the outdoor area behind the raw materials hall. The raw material solution that ran through the gate was able to enter a drain hidden beneath these pallets unnoticed. After the incident, the operator marked out restricted zones in the areas leading to the drains, into which, due to the gradient leading away from the raw materials hall, leaked raw material solution could run in spite of any and all measures taken. Management must check at least weekly that the designated restricted zones are always kept unobstructed. Staff are to be instructed that the restricted zones must be kept unobstructed. This instruction is to be documented.\nMeasure 9:The plant drainage plan must be revised. The drains running from the inlets in the yard behind the raw materials hall to the six-chamber tank at the SO2 installation must be recorded and shown.\n&nbsp;"

        "Accident Description": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 24th May 2007 at 1000 hours a tank exploded at the Vest Tank company in Sl\u00f8v\u00e5g in Gulen Municipality.&nbsp; Amongst other, the tank contained sulphur components and petrol products (gasoline) &nbsp;following the desulphurization of oil products.&nbsp; The explosion was violent and&nbsp;the tank was recketed&nbsp;into the rock wall behind. The explosion also led to a several nearby tanks containing oil products catching fire.&nbsp; Vest Tank\u2019s office building and several tankers were totally destroyed in the fire that followed. No persons were seriously injured from the explosion and the ensuing fire.\n&nbsp;\nEmergency response personnel from Gulen Fire Service participated in the acute phase. In addition, Bergen Fire Service and Hordaland Civil Defence District were called out.\n&nbsp;\nFollowing the incident many people living permanently in the near vicinity of the plant have experienced illness and unpleasant conditions consisting of nausea, vomiting and sore throats. Uncertainty surrounding the contents in the tanks resulted in the need for public information.&nbsp; At a later stage, information meetings and public meetings have been held to accommodate this aspect of the incident. Uncertainty still exists amongst the public regarding possible long-term effects from the chemicals involved despite documentation of the contents of the tanks.\n&nbsp;\nThe incident can be divided into two phases; the acute phase and the after phase.&nbsp; The acute phase consisted, amongst other, of fire extinguishing, the establishment of necessary emergency preparedness response at the location in relation to pollution of exterior surroundings, obtaining an overview of the total extent of damages and identifying the cause of the explosion.&nbsp; The after phase is related to complaints of illness, considerable and troublesome odorous smells and other types of unpleasantness experienced by the public.&nbsp; The Company where the accident took place has been and still is under investigation. What is now clear is amongst others that the activities that took place at the plant was not in accordance with the official permissions given to the plant.&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "For some months prior to the accident, the tank involved and the neighbour tank had been used for treating an oil product (coker gasoline) in order to reduce the sulphur&nbsp;components (such as mercaptanes (thiols))&nbsp;of the coker gasoline. The treatment was done with 30 % solution of NaOH in water. At the time the explosion took place, this activity had stopped, and the company added water and hydrocloric acid to the tank in order to neutralize the solution. This caused a slight exotermic reaction that lead to the formation of mercaptanes and other flammable gases from the coker gasoline residues, and subsequently an explosion when this gas was introduced to an ignition source. The flammable gas was ignited due to self- ignition in an activated carbon canister (self constructed carbon filter installed in order to limit the release of malodorous gases). The company had not installed a flame arrester between the tank and the carbon canister.Further detalis are given in the attached investigation report.&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "The plants permission for storage of flammable liquids was withdrawn&nbsp;after the accident, and there has not been regular operation at the plant since the accident occured. Financial costs&nbsp;are related to replacement of equipment, tanker trucks, decontamination.No people were injured in the accident itself, but following the incident many people living permanently in the near vicinity of the plant have experienced illness and unpleasant conditions consisting of nausea, vomiting and sore throats.

The biogas plant has been provided with a connection for an emergency generator set.The filling level of the digestate in digestate store 3 is said to have been around one-third (approx. 1.80&nbsp;m). However, this cannot be verified.The gas link between digestate store 3 and digestate store 4 was closed due to the damage that had occurred on 24 February 2017.During the work on the transformer (12:00 - 14:00), the electricity supply to the entire biogas plant frequently failed.\nThe biogas still being produced in the three lines is compressed entirely by means of gas compressors for gas processing.

According to the digitally documented measurements, the pressure in the system increased from 5% (approx. 0.5 mbar, 10:30) to an initial peak (30%, approx. 11:50) to 65% (approx. 3.9&nbsp;mbar, approx. 14:00) before then the roof of the digestate store tore and the pressure fell again.\nSafety measures:Immediate closure of all gates in the gas system.In order to prevent further overflow of substrate from digester 3 into digestate store 3, the fill level of the digester was lowered by pumping. Digestate store 3 was emptied and prepared for the installation of a new roof.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The tear in the roof of digestate store 3 was caused by a steep increase in pressure from approx. 0.5&nbsp;mbar to 3.9&nbsp;mbar between 12:00 and 14:00. This increase in pressure can be explained by the fact that the biogas produced in digester 3 and digestate store 3 could not be extracted from the sub-installation.\nAt this time, work was being carried out on the power supply in order to implement a robust emergency power plan. For this reason, the biogas temporarily could not be moved on either by compressors for gas processing or by flares from the plants. It was not possible to reconstruct whether the pressure relief device had started to be discharged at the set pressure of approximately 3.5 mbar. The pressure increased beyond that to approximately 3.9 mbar until the roof of digestate store 3 tore.\nThe damage of 20 June 2017 therefore occurred as a result of a simple disruption of operation through internal pressure that was too high for the worn roof. The installed, inherently safe overpressure and vacuum protection system was not able to sufficiently reduce the internal pressure before the worn roof was destroyed.",
        "Consequences": "Torn roof.Costs: &euro; 25,000",
        "Emergency response": "Gas from fermenter disconnected, partial emptying of digester 3 in order to avoid further overflow into digestate store 3, emptying of digestate store 3.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nConstruction of a new roof in accordance with the latest technical rules.\nIn this case, it is planned to install a rigid stainless steel roof.\nApplication for authorisation has been submitted.\n\n\nCurrent incident plan is in place.\nIn the light of the event it will be fine-tuned as regards the reporting chain and the use of the prescribed forms.\nAdaptation of the emergency plan.\n"

        "Accident Title": "Operator killed by explosion in a batch reactor  while filling through open manhole",
        "Start Date": "2006-06-02 00:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "2006-06-02 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident, its development and consequencesOn the 2nd of June 2006, an operator was killed by an explosion in a batch reactor. At the time of the accident, he was closing the manhole of the reactor after loading solid raw materials through the manhole. The manhole lid was blown off by the explosion in the reactor and hit the operator in the face. The operator died instantaneous. The manhole was found several meters from the reactor. The sprinklers in the production building were automatically activated by the fire in the reactor. Neighbouring equipment was slightly damaged due to projectiles from the explosion. The accident had no consequences for the environment or for the surroundings.Process descriptionThe reactor is the first step in the batch production of polyesteracrylates. In the reactor polyols are esterificated with acrylic acid. This endothermic reaction is operated at ambient pressure and at a temperature between 80\u00b0C and 120\u00b0C. The process exists of different consecutive steps in different equipment (reaction, washing, filtration, stripping and concentration) and needs many manual interventions by the operator. The installations are located in a closed building.The accident happened in the loading phase of the reactor, which consists of:- loading of liquid catalyst from an isobulkcontainer (IBC). It is sucked in the reactor by putting the reactor under vacuum. This is done manually at the reactor.- manual loading of small quantities of solid raw materials (prepared in buckets) through the manhole- loading of solvent (toluene) from the bulk tank (controlled by DCS)- loading of acrylic acid from a bulk storage tank (controlled by DCS).The reaction is controlled by the process computer (DCS) through the flow rate of acrylic acid and the temperature. The operator checks the pH of a sample of the reaction product to determine whether the reaction is completed. If so, the product is transferred to the wash vessel and the reactor is rinsed with the solvent toluene, which is afterwards also added to the wash vessel. The reaction product and the wash toluene are transferred to the wash vessel using compressed air.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Accident scenario &amp; causesTwo of the three components of the fire triangle were with certainty present at the time of the explosion:- OxygenThe process was operated in oxygen containing atmosphere (ambient air). According to the company, in the initial design this was judged to be necessary to assure the acrylic acid inhibitor to inhibit the undesired autopolymerisation of the acid. - Flammable substanceThe reactor is washed with toluene between two batches. After the washing, there are still toluene vapours present in the reactor. Calculations performed by the company before the accident estimate the concentration of the toluene/air mixture at approx. 5 vol%. Given the explosion limits of toluene of 1.2 vol% and 7 vol% at ambient temperature, the reactor contained an explosive toluene/air mixture in the gas phase when the operator was manually loading raw materials through the open manhole. The ignition of the toluene/air mixture is most likely due to an unwanted chemical reaction between the raw materials that were loaded manually through the manhole of the reactor. Laboratory tests performed during the accident investigation identified a reaction between three of the five manually loaded solids. The heat production rate is low at ambient temperature but raises rapidly from 70\u00b0C on. At 90-100\u00b0C, a violent exothermic reaction occurs with the production of carbon oxide, carbon dioxide and phosphine. Phosphine&nbsp; autoignites at 100\u00b0C. The explosion was most likely an explosion of the toluene/air mixture in the reactor, ignited by the auto-ignition of phosphine. Because the solid materials are added to a nearly empty reactor (contained only 100 litre of liquid catalyst), they could accumulate at the reactor wall below the manhole. This wall is supposed to have been at a temperature around 80\u00b0C, since the previous batch was stopped at 80\u00b0C and based on evidence that the cooling was not turned on before the operator started the loading of the next batch. This means that the reactor wall was at a temperature very close to the start of the runaway reaction between the solids.The company claims that the normal operation was to load one third of the solvent before the manual addition of the additives. This would have avoided the accumulation of the solids to the reactor wall and hence the runaway reaction igniting the toluene vapour.However the loading sequence was not clearly defined in the batch cards and instructions. Furthermore, the process computer software was not in accordance with the sequence supposed to be followed by the operators. During the last 15 years, several modifications were introduced (E.g. loading the solvent in two steps to avoid splashing when adding solid catalyst and raw materials,&nbsp; change from solid to liquid catalyst). As a consequence, operators often only launched the new batch on the process computer after having loaded the catalyst and the solid raw materials. Since the cooling of&nbsp; the reactor is only automatically activated by the DCS once the start of a new batch is launched on the process computer, this deviation in the loading procedure implied that the reactor was not cooled during manual loading unless the operator started the cooling manually. The normal sequence implies an exposure to toluene vapours when loading the raw materials during the manhole. This exposure issue was formally identified by the company in risk and work place studies since 2001. Operators were supposed to wear breathing protection masks, but this was not formally and strictly imposed nor supervised. Due to the lack of clear batch cards and instructions and the lack of supervision by management, the loading sequence differed from shift to shift and even between operators of the same shift. As for the sequence followed by the victim, some of the operators intended to avoid toluene exposure - and thus the need of wearing a breathing mask - by adding the toluene after all the manual loading via the manhole. The risk study on the process was incomplete:- not all process steps were addressed (E.g. toluene washing of the reactor between two batches)- the explosion risk was not adequately evaluated (only measures to avoid ignition source, no question whether oxygen was really needed during the loading phase)- the loading sequence was not investigated (was supposed to be correct and followed in practice)- not all risks were identified (dangerous reactions between raw materials, use of compressed air for the transfer of solvents between vessels).An incident in July 2003 on a similar reactor indicated possible dangerous reactions between the solid raw materials.&nbsp; The follow up of the conclusions of the incident investigation was insufficient. A project aiming addition of all raw materials with closed systems (hoppers) and working in lean air conditions was planned for implementation later in 2006. The organisational changes within the company over the last years significant influenced the delay in taking technical improvement measures. The establishment changed of legal entity mid 2004 with a view of being taken over by a worldwide group, with a freezing of investments as a consequence. The take over in 2005 lead to significant changes on management level and staffing.&nbsp; The safety management system, which was in process of being adapted to the SMS guidelines of the new group who took over the company, did not assure an evaluation of the impact on safety of this kind of organisational changes.

        "Emergency response": "\nFire was limited to inside of the reactor.\nVictim was killed instantanious.\nMain intervention was securing the installation and cleaning up\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "Lessons learned:\n\nAll process hazards, including all possible dangerous interactions between chemicals, should be identified.\nRisk studies on batch processes should consider all process steps and conditions.\nMeasures eliminating the existence of an explosive atmosphere should always have priority to measures preventing the ignition of that atmosphere.\nLoading of products through an open manhole into flammable atmosphere is not good practice.\nRecommendations of risk studies and incident investigations need to be followed up systematically.\nThe safety responsibilities and duties of management should be clearly identified.\nWork instructions should be clear and periodically reviewed and actualised.\nThe process control system should correspond to the intended process method.\nAll changes to the process and process working methods should be evaluated as to their impact on safety (management of change procedure).\nThe management of change procedure should also address changes in organisational structure or in staff.\n\nActions taken/imposed:\n\nThe lean air project was implemented before restart up of the production lines. Other processes involving opening of manholes where identified and were only accepted to start up again if no flammable substances were involved.\nRaw materials are added via closed systems.\nBuckets are replaced by closed recipients.\nAll process risk studies will be revised and completed within a short time period. Priorities for the risk analysis program were made based on hazard potential of the processes involved.\nThe adaption process of the safety management system to the guidelines of the new group is accelerated and expected to be complete before the end of 2006, correcting at the same time the shortcomings identified in the accident investigation.\nManagement will be instructed on safety responsibilities and duties. \n"

        "Finish Date": "2020-08-07 18:45:00",
        "Accident Description": "The pressure monitor directly connected to the HF3 daily-supply tank detected increased pressure for four seconds and sounded an alarm as a result.When the alarm goes off, the circulation line\u2019s feed valve to the HF3 daily-supply tank closes automatically.The plant employees concluded that this brief peak in pressure was an incorrect measurement and consequently paid no further attention to it. The employees did not notice that the feed line had closed. In the process control system, the valve closing is displayed both as an alarm activation and in the associated PID.\nBecause the drainage pump attached to the daily-supply pump continued to operate, it drained liquid HF out of the HF3 daily-supply tank via the pipeline that was open for purposes of outgassing, in the opposite direction to the usual direction of flow, and into the HF2 production plant.Then, during the \u2018condensation\u2019 process step, two holding tanks (V1 and V2) in the HF2 production plant were filled with liquid HF from the HF3 daily-supply tank. Before the two holding tanks were unintentionally filled, they were filled to a level of 24% (equivalent to 800 kg of HF 100).Very soon, the level indication there warned that the maximum permitted fill level had been reached (100%, equivalent to 3,400 kg).\nAt first the plant employees suspected that there had been internal corrosion damage in the cooling system, as a result of which large amounts of cooling brine had ended up in the interior of the condensation tank. The exothermic reaction expected in such a situation did not happen, which puzzled the employees.\nThen the employees took additional measures to lower the critical fill level. In addition, they tried unsuccessfully to start one of the condensation tank\u2019s priming pumps. A second priming pump had already been removed for repair.After this, all inflows into the condensation process step were closed. After a short time, liquid HF overflowed from an inspection opening on top of the V2 holding tank.\nAt an outside temperature of approximately 32 \u00b0C, the liquid FH (boiling temperature 19 \u00b0C) rapidly transitions to the gas phase and quickly becomes visible as a white vapour.\nSafety measures:On-site fire service alerted.Once the fire service arrived, it contained the HF emissions by using mobile and fixed water monitors.Approximately 60 kg of HF 100, heavily diluted with water, was released into the acid drain in a controlled manner via the emergency drain in the \u2018condensation holding\u2019 floor area.The employees in the plant\u2019s own waste water treatment facility were informed of this.The automatic changeover from waste water to containment was overseen by employees and occurred without problems.No contaminated water was released into the River Neckar.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The plants were not in normal operation.\nHuman:\n\nThe employees categorised the activity as \u2018non-dangerous\u2019.\nThere was no structured risk assessment setting out special safeguards. Therefore no inspections of pipelines and instrumentation diagrams were carried out or documented.\nInadequate alarm management. The HH alarm and its line of action to the feed valve were not traced.\nInsufficient observation. Neither the activated alarm nor the visual display of the feed valve closing were observed.\nThe connection between circulation mode and overfill of the holding tank was not recognised.\n\nTechnical:\n\nThe screw joint on the holding tank (discharge point) is unsuitable.\nThe pump for lowering the holding tanks\u2019 critical fill levels is stuck.\nThe tank pressure measurement sends an erroneous signal (brief peak in pressure).\n",
        "Consequences": "Corrosion damage.",
        "Emergency response": "\nDeployment of on-site fire service (precipitation of fumes through the creation of water curtains using fixed and flexible water monitors).\nPrecautionary request for local rescue services (on standby on site).\nControlled drainage of approximately 60 kg, diluted with water, via the emergency drain in the tank floor into the acid drain in order to lower the fill level in the tanks.\nProviding information to the waste water treatment facility: accumulation of diluted hydrofluoric acid.\nWaste water from pH 6 on is sent to containment as a first step. In the second step, the contaminated water is again neutralised in the waste water treatment facility and the fluoride is broken down.\nAfter the event: The contaminated plant areas are cleaned.\n\nThe corrosion damage is inspected \u2013 as needed, equipment is replaced or the corrosion protection is refurbished.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nRevise the risk analysis for the area of the HF plants.\nReplace the HF inspection nozzle in conformity with the pipe class for hydrogen fluoride.\nAdapt the maintenance strategy concerning feed pump replacement.\nInstall an additional monitor in the control room to improve alarm management.\nImplement a training module for standard alarm management.\nTrain employees in alarm management.\nDocument activation measures in PIDs in the case of non-routine operating conditions.\n\nIt must be pointed out that, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HF plants were under temporary conditions. The HF2 production line was undergoing degasification in preparation for maintenance work; the HF3 production line was in circulation mode in order to prevent the pumps from becoming stuck.According to information from the operator, under normal operations these situations would not occur simultaneously. Because the possibility of mutual interference had not been investigated, the sequence of events resulting in this emission could not have been recognised in advance.\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Commission\u2019s Major Accident Hazards Bureau (MAHB) has developed a \u2018Lessons Learnt Bulletin\u2019:https://minerva.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/shorturl/minerva/llb_covidv3pdf\nIn addition, the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) has published a document addressing plant and process safety in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, with the title \u2018Be Smart: Safe Restart \u2013 Re-Starting Chemical Production Facilities Post COVID-19 Restrictions\u2019:https://www.americanchemistry.com/Be-Smart-Safe-Restart.pdf\n&nbsp;"

This was probably a contributing factor to the failure to achieve full industrial alarm, but only normal call-outs.",
        "Lesson Learned": "1. As it must be expected that a control loop may fail, and since in this case it could potentially lead to serious consequences, it is recommended to install barrier(s) that reduce the likelihood for such events. Improvement of barriers had not been realised when the incident took place due to prioritisation in the project portfolio.\n2. It is recommended to consider whether there is a need to improve heat/cold insulation and possibly install heating cable/steam follower pipes on standpipe for level measurement. It is recommended to make similar assessments in other facilities/equipment if freezing could potentially occur and if this could have serious consequences.\n3. Factories should address, on the shifts, the importance of analysing and assessing abnormal sounds, vibrations and movements in process equipment.

The fire occurred the day production had been shut down for the annual holiday closure of the establishment. The excavated area (50x30m) was partly surrounded by a protection wall and, protected by fire extinguishing tower and had only one access. All pyrotechnic waste materials could only be transferred to the incineration area after authorisation given the safety and environmental protection service. The waste materials of the company and/or other companies were transported to the area soaked in water. It was necessary to reduce the water content in the waste materials up to a certain degree in order to proceed with burning , this operation was performed by adding powder charges to the waste pyrotechnic materials. Before incineration in the excavated area., waste material was placed in a string disposition on pallets The presence of a specially adapted fire extinguishing vehicle was mandatory for burning large quantities of waste materials. On 24/07/2006, the powder ignited spontaneously while the operator working since 1987 in the burning area was preparing the area with an agricultural tractor. The worker under shock could leave the tractor without suffering injuries.On 28/07/2006 in the morning, the Safety and Environmental Protection service foreman, conscious about the extreme hazard represented by the stored waste materials decided to burn the waste materials.The foreman started to prepare the operation with the help of two workers of the production department (the two qualified workers of the Safety and Environmental Protection Service were absent).The waste materials (composed by humid finished gun powder and graphite) was to be placed on pellets, raked and spread on the pallets such to ease the drying process. On beginning of the afternoon they distributed 2 supplies of waste material in layers on the pellets in absence of the fire extinguishing vehicle. A spontaneously ignited fire started at about 15:00 hrs near to the foreman who remained imprisoned by the flames and the smoke. The two other workers succeeded to escape from the area without being injured. One of them a volunteer fire fighter triggered alarm and started to fight the fire. The foreman was found 30 m from the fire ignition point near the border of the retaining wall, he died within 1 hour due to the consequences of his injuries. The fire may have ignited due to friction of the powder (dry powder + polluted humid powder therefore more sensitive) caused by a falling/slipping pallet or by the foreman involuntarily stepping on a pallet. A disposable not functioning lighter was found near the ignition point. The production of the establishment will re-start after implementing compensatory measures. The company is also obliged to perform other studies, like on the soil pollution caused by the fire, kind and nature of the waste materials etc.The accident is notified, due to one fatality occurred (level 2 of the index \"human and social consequences\" of the European accident gravity scale - parameter H3)",

        "Accident Description": "At 1.15 on Sunday, a fire broke out in the powder detergent filling plant on the south side of the first floor. While the public fire department was operating on the scene, an explosion occurred at 2.07. Following the explosion, the fire spread to a warehouse on the north side of the first floor, used to store raw materials for the production of detergents. Around 4.00 the fire on the north side of the first floor was suppressed, but the north side of the second floor, where household melamine sponge products are stored, was on fire. At 9.47 the fire on the north side of the second floor was suppressed, however at 14.30, the south side of the second floor was on fire. Emergency responders managed to control the fire completely at 7.15 Monday morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "The fire in the south side of the first floor (powder detergent filling plant) was initiated either due to electrical or chemical factors. According to the investigation, the moisture content of sodium percarbonate and the plant's temperature would not allow for an exothermic decomposition thus, the chemical factor is excluded.\nThe fire spread to the north side of the first floor due to an explosion and after approximately 7 hours the fire spread to the north side of the second flour through gaps in the walls around the ceiling. The fire was then spread over a 7-hour period to the south side of the second floor by heat conduction through the wall and fire shutters.",
        "Consequences": "There were four fatalities, including one police officer and three firefighters. Also, four people were injured, one moderately and three slightly. The warehouse was completely destroyed. Roads of about 100m adjacent to the factory were restricted. Resin and soot were scattered in the direction of about 20 m.",
        "Emergency response": "The fire alarm was activated on the south side and the security company called the emergency services. Firefighting lasted over 24 hours.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Overall, the investigation showed a lack of in-depth knowledge and understanding of risks surrounding the handling and storage of sodium percarbonate as well as insufficient safety management and emergency preparedness practices. Sodium percarbonate is a strong oxidizer that may cause fire and explosion as well as intensify fire. Safety management, including training and awareness on safe handling and storage of sodium percarbonate, acceptance of incoming raw material, firefighting components and fireproofing are highlighted. The following measures are suggested:\nStrengthen the safety management system\n\nEnhance training on prevention and preparedness\nPromote safe handling of substances, manufacturing processes and storage methods\nImprove risk assessment on raw materials, composition (mixture), processes and equipment\nImplement standards for installation and management of electrical infrastructure and equipment inside factories and warehouses\nCompliance with the Fire Service Act and thorough implementation of disaster prevention measures for factories and warehouses\nEnsure safety throughout operations including risk assessment in planning and development of processes as well as selection of materials, processing methods, transportation and storage\nEnhance auditing and selection of suppliers to avoid importing non-compliant raw materials through an efficient&nbsp; safety management system by implementing a process for inspection and thorough material acceptance inspection\nSet up inspections to control whether the processing or handling of materials is not according to their specifications\n\nEnsure thorough shipping inspection of incoming materials\nImprove safety controls and structural design, including firefighting infrastructure, temperature/humidity monitoring, as well as structural components and fireproofing\nPromotion of safety activities\n\nJoin the Japan Chemical Industry Association to collect information on various safety activities\nFormulation and promotion of factory management standards\n\nStrengthening safety awareness, in all factories by organising training on chemical safety and seminars\nFostering a safety culture"

This was recovered for reprocessing without incident or known damage to the environment.",
        "Causes of the accident": "An undetected failure in the tank guaging system led operators\nto believe that the starting level in this receiving tank was\napproximately 6 m lower than the lower than the actual level.\nConsequently an over large parcel of product was planned for transfer.\nThe independent high level alarm sounded but gave operators\ninsufficient time to react to avert a spillage. The high level alarm\nwas not linked to a trip on the pump on the adjacent refinery site.Current safety report\ndoes not give in-depth consideration to vessel overfilling (but does\ndeal with the same end result of spillage for a tank failure). A review\nof tank high level alarm placement and tripping of pumps is needed.\nResponse time to re spill was poor and some training here is though to\nbe appropriate.",

Operators took in fact 11 half minutes to stop flow.\nThe high level alarm is not currently linked to a trip on the pump\nitself. Ideally it should be.Measures to prevent recurrence: Daily manual dipping of tanks is now taking place and less reliance is being placed on tank gauges which, like any piece of plant, are subject to failure.  In any case, it seems clear that the tank's high level alarm should be repositioned to give much more warning of impending overfills.  Ideally, the high level alarm should be capable of tripping off the product pump.Measures to mitigate consequences: Once there, the consequences were dealt with well.Useful references: Information suggests that at least one other site, Kingsbury, high level alarms give much more warning and trip off the pump."

Instrument air pressure dropped but no back up air available, being off-line because of maintenance.  Plant shut-down procedure initiated but isolation valve connecting high pressure gas vessel ultimately failed to close due to a) the main instrument air being unavailable and b) the final safety instrument air reservoir for closing the hydraulic isolation valve having an open drain line ie was unpressurised.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Maintenance on safety air reservoir system to hydraulic isolation valve 2 yrs previous probably resulted in air reservoir being left with open drain to atmosphere.  When instrument air pressure fell during production, back-up works air supply not available and plant shut-down sequence initiated by operators.  Hydraulic isolation valve cycled to allow molten polymer/waste ethylene to move out of separator (to prevent it cooling/solidifying) to hopper (and remaining plant).  Hopper instrumentation detecting overpressure then required valve to close and allow ethylene to be diverted to process plant to reduce pressure, but pressure in safety air balance reservoir system quickly depleted.  Ultimately the isolation valve between the 2 vessels failed to close, allowing low pressure hopper to be overpressurised  and bursting disc safety feature to operate.",
        "Consequences": "No injuries, plant damage (apart from bursting disk), fire or explosion. Vented gas dissipated to atmosphere where it was diluted to safe level.",
        "Emergency response": "On-site Emergency actions taken immediately to locate and manually close isolation valve between high and low level pressure vessels which then cut off source of ethylene to the low pressure vessel and stopped the venting.

The gravity level according to the international scale being used at the moment is 3 (based on the criterion related to material damage).\n\nThe material damage is large and the costs exceed the threshold stated in Annex VI of the Directive. Therefore, the accident must be notified to the European Union. \n",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident was caused by lightning that struck the tank, but the exact causes and circumstances have yet to be evaluated by experts.\nIt should be noted that the tank was not fitted with flame arrestors on the vents.\nIn addition, as the tank was 4/5 empty, and given the  temperature reached by the tank shell, the gaseous atmosphere must have been considerable.",
        "Consequences": "The damage caused as a result of the accident is estimated to be more than 2.3 M Euros (2,300,000 euros).\nNo one was injured.",
        "Emergency response": "A pool fire (fire of the retention basin)&nbsp; is avoided by pouring out emulsifiers. The neighbouring tanks are cooled with water sprays. The fire is declared extinguished around 19:45.The different tanks are sprinkled (sprayed down) until 23:00, when the fire department ends the emergency response operations. The quantity of emulsifiers stocked on the site (23,000 l) is sufficient to extinguish the fire. The water used for fire fighting is collected in the retention ponds.The extinguishing water supply was restored during the same evening by pumping water from the river which flows at a distance of about 500 m from the site. New emulsifiers were ordered.Being a classified hazardous installation, the Distillery and Sugar Factory was subject to the ministerial decree of 28 January 1993 on the protection against lightning of certain installations classified in relation to environmental protection (an obligation which was included also in the governor's order concerning the site).This ministerial decree states in Article 2 that the lightning protection devices must comply with the French norm C 17-100, while in Article 6 a time limit of 6 years is granted for the modification of existing equipment in order to comply with the norm.The circular letter No. 93-17 of 28 January 1993 on the application of the ministerial decree requires the plant operator to provide a preliminary lightning protection report.The operator submitted this study on 9 December 1998. The recommendations included the installation of fire arrestors on the vents and breather valves for the various alcohol storage tanks.These fire arrestors had not been installed. The inspectorate of classified installations recorded the facts. In addition, an order was issued on 10th August giving the operator notice to install these devices within one month.",
        "Lesson Learned": "In May of the same year, the operators had carried out an Internal Emergency Plan training, based on the scenario of a fire involving one of the alcohol tanks. Therefore, the emergency services knew the site well, and the emergency equipment was set up quickly, in the context of a smoothly working emergency response system.The way in which the emergency response operations were carried out did not cause any particular remarks by the inspectorate.Direct protection devices against lightning (lightning conductors) were installed, but perhaps the wiring system designed for carrying the currents originating from atmospheric discharges (equipotential bonding between different tanks and the earthing points), located in determined positions to protect specific areas against lightning hazards, were inadequate.Also the absence of flame arrestors has contributed to setting off the explosion.According to the evidence collected, it appears that another lightning struck a few moments before near to an electricity tower. The energy conducted to earth has certainly caused changes in the soil characteristics near the storage site.In conclusion, it must be remarked that&nbsp; 23,000 litres of&nbsp; emulsifiers and 7000 m3 of water were used during this accident."

        "Accident Description": "The operator has set up an internal committee of enquiry into the accident. Information gathered to date by the committee of enquiry suggests that the incident took place as follows:At around 08.57 on 15 May 2017, an external firm represented by its owner and two other people arrived at the Eltmann plant. A plant employee took them to the hardening shop.The external firm drove a cargo van directly to the hardening shop building. The mobile filter unit was unloaded directly adjacent to the hardening furnace in the area of the salt quenching bath. Apparently, an empty IBC (1,000 litre) container was delivered at the same time. This was placed next to an existing IBC container containing demineralised water.At 09.42, according to the hardening furnace records, the safety gate to the salt quenching bath was opened, presumably in order to place the lances of the filter unit in the salt quenching bath. The pump attached to the filter unit by the external firm was connected to the compressed air network. The compressed air connection was still in place when the emergency services arrived. An examination of the remains of the filter from the filter unit\u2019s second container, which did not explode, and of unused filters found in the external firm\u2019s van, showed that these were cellulose filters.The first filter run appears to have been successful. However, it is highly probable that following this first run, successful or not, the filter unit was flushed with water. Following the accident, one lance was in the empty IBC container and the other lance was in the container with demineralised water. According to the hardening furnace log, the safety gate to the salt quenching bath was also closed again at 10.06. The accident was reported at around 10.15.This flushing process was the probable cause of the explosion.During this process, in order to flush the (cellulose) filter clean with demineralised water, cold water came into contact with hot salt (hardening salt AS 135), which solidifies at 135 \u00b0C. The salt bath itself has a temperature of around 180 \u00b0C and it can be assumed that the salt deposited in the filter unit was still hotter than 100 \u00b0C.The operator\u2019s committee of enquiry is currently assuming that the injection of demineralised water and its sudden vaporisation upon contact with the hot molten salt led to a rapid increase in pressure, which caused the nitrided cellulose to decompose. The additional pressure that this created caused the filter housing to burst.Safety measures:Immediate deployment of the on-site fire brigade and other local fire brigades and emergency services.",
        "Causes of the accident": "A combination of the following events is currently assumed to be the cause:- Generation of decomposition gases from the chemical reaction of the filter element (cellulose) with the hardening salts;- Increase in pressure in the filter housing arising from the introduction of demineralised water for rinsing;- Further increase in pressure due to the release of oxygen from the thermal decomposition of the molten salt.For details see causes/course of event.",
        "Consequences": "Consequences:\nDamage to the building and soiling. Costs: &euro;150,000\nAs well as one dead and three injured people, a further five people were temporarily admitted to hospital due to psychological strain. A further 16 people were treated as out-patients.",
        "Emergency response": "Immediate evacuation, immediate deployment of the on-site fire brigade and other local fire and rescue services.The material damage in the hall will be repaired in the coming weeks. No damage outside the site.Support to the deployment of the fire brigade.",
        "Lesson Learned": "1) Risk level assessment: External staff are classed in risk categories (according to a traffic-light system).- Visitors on guided tours of the plant: green safety vests.- Outside firms: yellow or red visitor\u2019s passes depending on the risk of the work to be performed on site, to be assessed using technical risk assessments.2) Future procedure for outside firms:- Site rules for outside firms to be handed over- Risk level assessment to be performed- Registration form provided to be completed.3) instructions (as before)- The responsible contact person from the outside firm (usually the foreman) is instructed by the operator before starting work. The instruction must be repeated before each new job.- In the case of firms who permanently work on site, the instruction must be given at least once a year.- Written documentation relating to all instructions is available.The incidents officer carries out spot checks on the implementation of the ongoing measures."

        "Accident Description": "ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The jet-fire produced by the ignition of gas leaking from a flange caused the blast of a 600 mm pipe of the fractionating column 16 metres away and the explosion of 3 tanks containing, respectively, propylene, LPG and ethylene. The subsequent explosion and fire frightened the population. Sulphur dioxide was released by fire only for a initial (short) period of time. After this period, only carbon dioxide was released. On-site arrived a group of experts for a technical survey. They established that: - there was no immediate danger for the population to justify the immediate evacuation of the area because the released gases were immediately burned by the various small fires still existing;- to maintain the 3 controlled fires on the existing openings of the plant and create a safety zone with a water curtain for cooling the nearby plants and tanks. In this way the escaping gases were completely burned thus avoiding the risk of creating an explosive mixture and the presence of asphyxiating gases;- it was decided to left open the steam column existing in the lowest part of the storage tanks area, to cool the metallic supports of the tanks;- not convenient to restore neither the railway nor the highway nearby, due to the existing risk of fire in the tanks yard and in the cracking columns. This because it was not possible to exclude that a collapse of the column splitter Ethylene (80 m high) could involve the adjacent cracking columns, still full of highly flammable substances;- it was decided by ICAM, and approved by the experts, to set up a flare connected with the various points of the plant for burning the propylene coming from the refrigerating plant, and the other substances already in the plant, thus accelerating the exhaustion of the fire on the base of the cracking columns.",

        "Accident Description": "The explosion occurred on 10 October 2012, just before midday, when the unit was being restarted. Earlier that morning, we had switched over to oil fuel in order to scan for defective non-return valves on the water-injection purging circuit. A transfer from natural gas to oil fuel takes place every 15 days in the period mid-October to March to prevent problems with fuel solidifying in ducts due to colder external temperatures. After the test we switched back to natural gas and proceeded to restart the unit at approximately 11:48. During each start-up, the gas valves (regulating valve SRV and on-off valves VS4, GCV1, GCV2 and GCV4) are tested for tightness. The test did not detect any problems. We therefore proceeded with the start-up by opening the gas supply and activating the spark plugs. At approximately 11:58, excessive vibrations were detected, corresponding to the time of the explosion (methane deflagration) in the boiler. This triggered the shutdown of the gas turbine and the whole unit.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident occurred in the boiler after the gas turbine. Malfunction of the gas-turbine\u2019s shut-off valve/pressure-regulating valve (SRV) led to an accumulation of gas in the boiler during start-up, which exploded when the gas turbine was fired up. After the start-up tightness checks, valve SRV remained 3.5 % open. More specifically: During speed reduction, with valve VS4 closed (and tight), the pressure between the valves remained at 0 bars. On attaining the firing speed (420 rpm), the gas valves are opened (valve VS4, the main GCV1 gas valve is opened to 16 %) and the spark plugs are charged (for maximum 30 seconds). With the SRV remaining 3.5 % open, the pressure in the inter-valve section settled at 16 bars (it is normally 3.8 bars). An excessive gas flow was directed into the combustion chambers and the boiler (+7000 Nm\u00b3/h as against +2500 Nm\u00b3/h under normal circumstances with DCS).\nFiring occurred 19 seconds (normally +3 seconds) after main gas valve GCV1 started to open. This incident was caused by the SRV valve malfunction after the tightness test, but also by a failure to check the functioning of valves. After the tightness test, there were no further checks on the fully-closed positions of valves or abnormal pressure.",
        "Consequences": "There were no injuries or fatalities. The main damage was to the recovery boiler: the violent explosion destroyed the lower section of the boiler and deformed the connecting duct muffler. There were no adverse effects on the turbine or the heat exchanger tubes. ",
        "Emergency response": "The process was stopped and the facility was restored to a safe condition. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Need to provide for checks of the real position of regulating valves during start-up procedures. Need to provide for pressure checks during start-up procedures. "

This topvent remains open after the test.\u00a0Leakage tests new feedline on cracker \u2013 4/07: System is pressurized from the supply line on ground level +/- 0.5 bar with decocking air till a blind in the inlet line on top of the cracker\u00a0Pressure is checked by the panel operator by 4 pressure measurements on the inlet of the furnace radiant section. Decoke air is closed after pressurizing.An operator performs the leak tests (soap test) on different locations on the furnace. He didn\u2019t noticed the open vent valve.After a while field operator asks the panel operator to check the pressure (P-measurements radiant inlet)Pressure readings are OK in the opinion of the panel operator. On the DCS trend there\u2019s a minor decrease of pressure.An operator wants to release the pressure via drain on ground level, but notices the system is pressureless. The operator repeats pressure test and asks the panel operator to check the pressure again.Again the measurements are OK. However, this time the operator doesn\u2019t open the drain on the supply line but he opens a drain on the inlet of the radiant section. Air is released. Pressure loss test is considerred OK.Pressuretest erroneously executed: Downstream the feed valves a check valve is installed in the direction of the furnace convection section. The open vent valve is upstream on the top platform of these check valves. The pressure measurements, used for the pressure loss test are downstream the check valves. The check valves have caused that the pressure remained on the system downstream the check valves. The system upstream of the check valves with the open vent valve had become pressureless straight away. The operator has performed in this case a leak test on a pressureless system.\u00a0Start-up of cracker \u2013 5/07: Furnace is deblinded. Oven is starting to heat up. Steam flows through the supply line for 20h and also passes the open vent. On the 6th of July, right before the end of the late shift (last action of the operator before his shift switch), the supply line is lined-up with butane.Open vent leak: At the beginning of the night shift a white fog is seen on the top platform. The operator goes up and closes the open vent. The operator closed it, assuming it was steam coming out of the vent.For 1 hour and 20 minutes there was butane leaking from the vent into the open air, a total of 16 ton. (measured by flow measurement on the butane inlet line \u2013 12 T/h)",
        "Causes of the accident": "Pressure test erroneously executed: Downstream the feed valves a check valve is installed in the direction of the furnace convection section. The open vent valve is upstream on the top platform of these check valves. The pressure measurements, used for the pressure loss test are downstream the check valves. The check valves have caused that the pressure remained on the system downstream the check valves. The system upstream of the check valves with the open vent valve had become pressureless straight away. The operator has performed in this case a leak test on a pressureless system.The alignment of the pressure test has not been checked with the technical drawings (Pl&D, flowscheme). Because of this, the checkvalves were not noticed and therefore the pressuretest has failed.To the start-up of the furnace, a start-up checklist is required. One of the steps in this checklist, is checking the stops & caps. After the incident the checklist was nowhere to be found.Check-ups whereat the leak should have been detected: General check-up of the installation before use. This check-up consists of a complete examination of the installation and all the valves ought to be put in the right position and all the stops & caps ought to be checked. Verification of the performed actions via the start-up checklist.For 20 hours straight, there has been leaking steam from the vent. By carrying out the standard check rounds, this should have been noticed earlier.The earlier mentioned vent is not on the Pl&D (while it actually should be)",
        "Consequences": "For 1 hour and 20 minutes there was butane leaking from the vent into the open air, a total of 16 ton. ",
        "Emergency response": "Vent was closed.No further response needed.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\u00a0Pressure loss test was inadequately executed because of the checkvalves affecting the pressure measurements, therefore the open vent remained undetected so long.Use the schemes (P&ID\u2019s, flagsheets) in order to better execute pressure loss tests and by using them you can also take all the alignments in account.Punching/Check-up of the alignment before start-up has been qualitatively insufficient executed.Full check-up of alignment including stop & caps is always necessary.The checklist for start-up was not respected, not checked nor used. The importance and necessity of these checklists need to be more clear for everyone in the future.The standard check-rounds ought to reveal abnormal situations relatively fast. In this case, they were insufficiently executed.Planned actions by the company:General sensitization to underline the importance and necessity of being alert and thorough during the execution of the following:Correct use of checklistsPerforming check-roundsStops & capsCheck all the alignments of the air pressure tests with the corresponding schemes (Pl&D\u2019s, flowsheets) and have them double-checked by someone else.Update procedure of leak testing and add this incident as lesson learnt.Implement holdpoints in checklists before starting up the NC3 furnaces. The holdpoints must be verified and autographed before undertaking further steps to start-up/stop the ovens.Systematic checking the vents/drains on the entire refinery on stop & caps with the corresponding schemes."

        "Accident Description": "In a plastic materials plant, a safety disc burst on the medium pressure return on a compressor; 3.2 t of ethylene was discharged into the atmosphere, the quantity of dangerous substances released lie more than 5% over the threshold defined by the Seveso Directive. The disc burst subsequent to a rise in back-pressure in the primary compressor. This was because, on 10/07, a leak was detected on a grease bottle bleed valve on the medium pressure return on line 42 in the polyethylene shop. The bottle was cooled pending repair. The line was stopped on 20/07 at 4 a.m. for the work, then brought back into operation at 6 p.m.&nbsp;The worker in charge started the primary compressor in accordance with the normal procedure, the pressure run-up was monitored in automatic mode. The pressure measured at the inlet to the secondary compressor was over 300 bar and a back-pressure relief valve on the primary compressor should have opened at 284 bar. Furthermore, the primary compressor should have been put on stand-down automatically at 270 bar, and was not. The worker in charge noted an abnormal rise in pressure and switched to manual mode. But this action was too late and did not prevent the pressure from rising to 310 bar, resulting in the disc bursting. The primary compressor did not go on stand-down because the pressure rise adjustment gauge was partially blocked up (measurement less than actual pressure). The pressure relief valve did not open due to a mistake by maintenance: when replacing pressure relief valves, a non-compliant relief valve (pressure set at over 310 bar) was installed. In addition, the obstruction of the medium pressure return section combined with several days' running without bleeding grease off increased the speed at which the pressure rose. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "The accident was due to the pressure being too high at the input to the secondary compressor. At over 300 bar, the pressure was due to the primary compressor not going to stand-down because the pressure rise adjustment gauge was partially blocked up (measurement less than actual pressure). Added to this, an unsuitable pressure relief valve failed to open (pressure set at over 310 bar).",

It began an inventory of tubular supports (trunnions) to ensure that they were correctly identified and assess their condition. It removed the rock wool sometimes found inside the supports, which is conducive to corrosion, and planned for replacements where necessary. It reviewed the fire and gas system architecture and the associated control system (possibility of filtering alarms) and raised awareness among control room operators. It increased explosive gas detector and fire camera coverage."

        "Accident Title": "Leakage of cyclohexane at a nylon salt chemical plant",
        "Start Date": "2002-12-16 09:00:00",
        "Finish Date": "2002-12-17 15:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "Leakage of 1,200 t of cyclohexane at a chemicals plant principally making nylon salt.The accident was notified because the quantity of toxic material involved was 1,200 t (which is &gt;= 5% of the upper limit).The accident was classified level 4 on the scale as officially published in February 1994 by the Comity of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive, the factor resulting in that level of classification being the quantity of substance involved according to current information.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The first valve on the DN50 mm branch pipe is permanently open, only\nthe ADN unit admission valve is closed (this second valve is opened\nonly when the ADN unit needs cyclohexane), the DN50 mm branch pipe is\nthus permanently kept up to pressure (2 to 3 bars). The steam heating,\ncontrolled by a valve, has been in the \"off\" position since an unknown\ndate, for unknown reasons. It no longer maintains the cyclohexane in\nliquid form.\n\nIn early December 2002, a cold snap caused the cyclohexane to solidify\nin the branch pipe. The temperature varied greatly over the weekend of\n15-16 December, and the resulting expansion and contraction of the\ncyclohexane caused the branch pipe to rupture at the expansion loop\n(hole about the size of the palm of a hand), being the part most\nexposed to the changes in temperature because of its shape and position\nup above the pipeway. \n\nOn 16 December 2002 at about 9 a.m., the Olone unit shift crew noted a\npoor supply of cyclohexane. Filters were changed, the pumps checked,\nthe DN100 mm main pipe inspected and the ADN unit interrogated. The\nfollowing day, as the problem persisted, a visual inspection of the\nDN50 mm branch pipe was organised. The leak of cyclohexane was found by\nsmell: it had occurred on the expansion loop on the DN50 mm branch pipe\nsupplying the ADN unit.\n",
        "Consequences": "About 30 hours had elapsed between the beginning of the cyclohexane supply problems and the leak being stopped. The leak was initially estimated at a few tonnes. The operator took a physical stock 10 days later and reassessed the leak at between 850 and 1,200 tonnes.After the leak, the cyclohexane was mostly absorbed into the gravelly ground. Only a few small pools of solidified cyclohexane could be seen below the leak; a fraction of the cyclohexane also escaped into the atmosphere as gas. At the upper surface of the water table at a depth of some 15 metres, the cyclohexane tended to spread rapidly (floating pool). After a few days, the cyclohexane spill was in four forms in the subsoil: &nbsp;- A pool of cyclohexane floating at the top of the water table, representing 70 to 85% of the tonnage spilt from the leak;&nbsp;- Cyclohexane captured in the subsoil by capillary action representing 15 to 30 % of the tonnage spilt;&nbsp;- Cyclohexane dissolved in the water table (less than 1 % of the tonnage spilt);&nbsp;- Cyclohexane in gaseous form in the subsoil (less than 1% of the tonnage spilt).The pool of floating cyclohexane accounted for the largest part of the cyclohexane spilt. It was also the source of supply for the cyclohexane captured in the subsoil by capillary action, the cyclohexane dissolved in the water table and the cyclohexane present in gaseous form. The pollution of the water table, one of the biggest in the region in the last 10 years, is a risk of contamination for mains drinking water catchments and agricultural bore holes located below it. The cyclohexane did not catch fire or explode. The flash point was not reached. The overall cost of the leak and the actions that followed is estimated at 2 M euros.",
        "Emergency response": "When the leak was discovered, the valve at the start of the DN50 mm branch pipe was closed, immediately stopping the leak. The supply to the Olone unit returned to normal. An existing borehole, 30 m from the leak (bore n\u00b0 23), was put into operation in order to create an exhaust cone (flow = 900 m//h). The existing hydraulic barrier (network of 25 bore holes distributed around the chemicals plant creating a negative pressure of about 2 m aimed at preventing any downstream migration of pollution in the water table) was adapted so as to guarantee confinement of the pollution within the industrial site. At the end of August 2003, the situation on work undertaken was as follows:&nbsp;- 55 observation wells (diameter 115 mm) were bored at the site to ascertain the extent of the pollution, pump the floating cyclohexane, vent gas and conduct analyses. This work required special precautions to be taken to prevent any risk of explosion when drilling;&nbsp;- 2 bore holes to secure the cyclohexane were drilled with lowering of the water table (diameter 300 mm);&nbsp;- 1 sparging barrier 300 m long was set up at the northern limit of the site to reinforce the existing hydraulic barrier (injection of air into the water table and recovery of gas by 18 doubled bore holes);&nbsp;- 4 observation wells were drilled downstream of the site (in addition to the 3 existing);&nbsp;- several hundred cyclohexane analyses were conducted in the observation wells (on site and downstream) by an external laboratory (detection limit 5 \u00b5g/l for a potability limit of 10 \u00b5g/l). This work enabled the extent of the pollution to be limited. At the end of August 2003 the spill extended beneath the industrial site over an area 600 m long and 300 m wide. The thickness of the floating cyclohexane varied from a few centimetres to a dozen centimetres. At the end of August 2003, 480 t of cyclohexane had been extracted from the subsoil (more than 90 % of it in floating form), by means of the 3 recovery systems in place: skimming the floating layer, venting and sparging. Investigations were conducted on biological treatment of the pollution using bacteria, specifically to denature cyclohexane, detected at the periphery of the polluted area. The authorities acted as follows: &nbsp;- Monitoring and ascertaining the facts,&nbsp;- conducting 5 inspections, on 8 January, 7 March, 13 June, 2 and 3 July 2003;&nbsp;- proposing 2 emergency orders by the Prefect on 9 January 2003 (circumstances of the leak, pollution control, surveillance, feedback, information for the authorities) and 12 March 2003 (boosting pumping, downstream surveillance, independent expert assessment);&nbsp;- organising 7 meetings with the operator (including 3 on information for the authorities);&nbsp;- compiling several dozen reports, statements and letters to the Prefect and the operator as well as to elected representatives, environmental protection associations, the courts and media.A workgroup made up of the DRIRE, DDASS, DDAF and DIREN was specially formed to monitor and assess the consequences of the leak and suggest to the Prefect any necessary protective measures to be imposed relative to safety and public health. The workgroup concentrated mainly on:&nbsp;- the operator checking the effectiveness of the hydraulic barrier in place, so as to contain the pollution within the industrial site and prevent any downstream contamination;&nbsp;- recovering the cyclohexane;- monitoring the water table downstream of the chemicals plant.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Various actions aimed at preventing a repetition of any such leak were implemented:1) On the cyclohexane branch pipe that leaked:&nbsp;- installation of flow measurement on all cyclohexane lines with relaying to the Olone control room (materials report displayed with alarms), &nbsp;- drafting of instructions in the event of non-use of the line (closure of the admission valve, draining down);&nbsp;- annual inspection of the steam heating system;&nbsp;- regular check on the condition of piping in the pipeway;&nbsp;- assumption of a leak as soon as a fault is detected (information for staff + instructions).2) On the site's other pipework carrying dangerous fluids:&nbsp;- procedure for allocating responsibilities between the different units on the site;&nbsp;- 67 programmed modifications to dangerous fluid transfer lines;&nbsp;- specification of methods of inspection and maintenance on operation of the steam heating system.A procedure for informing the authorities in the event of an incident was drafted jointly with the Prefecture. It has been tested since early 2003. This procedure includes in particular a rating of the incident established by means of a table covering the nature of the chemical (toxic, flammable, #), the size of the leak, the impact on the site and off the site. A separate rating assesses the potential impact on the basis of the volume of the system (potential leakage), the controllability of the event, the operability of safety systems, the potential impact on the site and off the site, quantifying damage and business interruption. The information is sent to national authorities (CODIS, Prefecture, Police, DRIRE, labour inspectorate, CRAM, emergency services) and to local authorities. The application of this procedure resulted in the company reporting 16 incidents between January and November 2003.The Chalamp\u00e9 chemicals plant has become the pilot site in the company's group for information for the authorities. The leak revealed:&nbsp;- technical malfunctions: failure of the steam heating system, absence of information in real time (materials assessment) and alarm enabling the leak to be detected;&nbsp;- the absence of inspection programmes covering the equipment involved (branch pipes, steam heating system, #) and the actual appointment of people responsible for the inspections;&nbsp;- the absence of suitable instructions in the event of a leak;&nbsp;- communication problems between the three departments involved;&nbsp;- the presence of an unused, large dimension branch pipe without retention because the DN50 mm branch pipe admission valve is kept open;&nbsp;- inappropriate reactions by operatives due to the aforementioned technical and organisational shortcomings and the absence of diagnostic support systems in the event of an alarm going off;&nbsp;- incomplete information on the incident.The leak enabled:&nbsp;- the effectiveness of the hydraulic barrier to be confirmed (set up in the nineteen eighties following pollution of communes' potable water sources due to the chemicals plant);&nbsp;- action programmes to be upgraded and launched to prevent a further substantial leak;&nbsp;- information to the authorities and adjoining communes to be rethought;&nbsp;- the plant to be reminded of its duty of care and of the control of processes and the risks presented by its facilities;&nbsp;- expertise and experience to be quickly assembled in the various departments tasked with public health, protection of the environment, the water authority and classified facilities authority through the workgroup."

The cleaned fuel gas is conveyed into the refinery's fuel gas network and the charged diisopropanolamine is regenerated for reuse. The hydrogen sulphide separated during regeneration is transformed into sulphur by the Claus-plants.When the event occurred the low-level shut-down system of the column triggered. Under normal conditions a control valve would have closed and the column level would have risen again. The control valve however was blocked in open position by metal parts (column internals) and the column level dropped to zero. The charged diisopropanolamine was diverted entirely to the regenerator and a gas break-through of H2S occurred over the diisopropanolamine-regenerators towards the Claus-plants.Both the Claus-plants and the downstream catalytic post-combustion unit were overcharged and the gas containing H2S was discharged over the 175m high chimney of the cracker without almost any conversion into sulphur dioxide. The gas-flow rate to the units was regulated to a fixed value and the excess gas was diverted to the H2S-flare In order to prevent the complete breakdown of the Claus-plants.A gas overpressure occurred in the flare system breaking through the hydraulic lock of the earth-tank connected the flare system. The path to the environment was opened, due to the fact that at the same time the sluice system was being prepared for a pressure test and that condensate was being flushed in the tank. This way the flushing medium containing minimal residual amounts of ADIP, fuel gas and H2S were released into the environment.The jammed valve was unblocked and the flare-line shut-off as soon the event dynamics were understood.",

        "Consequences": "Strong odour nuisance &gt; 1h\u200b",
        "Emergency response": "When the column low-level alarm triggered the operator of the subcontractor performed an inspection at the column, and could not detect any faults. Shortly after a high gas-yield was detected in the diisopropanolamine regenerator. Almost at the same time an air-compressor of the Claus-plant and a regenerator failed.The gas flow to the Claus-plants was reduced in order to avoid a complete failure of the plants and the remaining flow was diverted to the H2S flare system. Shortly after release of liquid was detected at the diisopropanolamine -sluice system. The staff was informed that this system had been flushed and sealed and that the regularly scheduled system testing was being performed. For this reason initially the spillage of liquid was not related to the occurrence.&nbsp; Due to the fact that the gas flow at he regenerator still was high, the load at the hydrocracker was reduced immediately by switching over to a a low sulphur crude oil. Further to that the load of the separator before the columns was reduced, in order to reduce the gas flow rate.By 10:28 hrs two gas detectors triggered alarm. Further gas alarms were triggered by 10:30 and 10:32. The shift-leader was informed. The fire department informed the onsite fire-brigade about complaints on odour nuisances in the neighbourhood of the plant. Meanwhile it was understood that the leakage of liquid and gas from the sluice system did not depend from the testing procedures but was related to the incident.The installations were immediately evacuated and inspected by staff members equipped with auto respirators. Following to that the fire brigade was requested to create a foam carpet on the pits of the sluice system in order to avoid further odour nuisances. Parallel to that the off-site fire department communicated that there were complaints about odour nuisances. In accordance with the on-site fire brigade and the fire department an accident notification with possible off-site consequences (D2 notification) was issued, the emergency management team and the emergency response team were alerted. Controls of the on site fire brigade and of the plant staff showed that there was no acute hazard neither on-site nor off-site the installation.The D2 notification was scaled down to D1 (incident without potential off-site consequences)&nbsp; at 13:09. At 13:47 the D1 notification was called back. The extinguishing water was collected in the retention pond for superficial waters and the pumps were shut down in order to allow analysis of the water before pumping it to disposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;External services:The fire-brigade performed inspection rounds and measurements.",

The operator in charge, standing in front of the opened manhole, was fatally injured by the explosion.\nThe day of the event, 12 tons of process water effluents from a receiver were transferred into a mixing vessel and treated with 150 kg of solid iron chloride (FeCl3) in sulphuric acid (60%), setting pH 2.5-3.0. The pH was controlled by taking a sample with a manual sampler and tested with a portable pH testing equipment externally to the vessel.After the third test, the pH was at 2.9, corresponding to default parameters. The operator in charge decided to perform a last test after a short stirring time, in order to guarantee a stable pH value.According to the analysis of the damage, an explosion occurred in the gas space of the mixing vessel (the presence of a highly flammable liquid in the mixing vessel must have formed an explosive vapour-air mixture in the gas space of the vessel). The operator in charge, standing in front of the opened manhole, was fatally injured by the explosion.Hydrogen peroxide 35%, which according to operating instructions had to be fed in after setting the pH value, had still not been added due to the fact that the manual pH test had not been concluded.The meeting in time and space of a ignitable explosive atmosphere with an ignition source has to be traced back to a deviance in the operating conditions and was not to be expected in that form.",

        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Boliden's manual for operation, supervision and maintenance of dams contains an emergency response plan. It has been verified that the routines in this plan worked well as regards both contacts and measures. One deficiency was noted, the possibility to set off the alarm for high water level in the clarification pond without any immediate follow up investigation. Therefore the routines have been changed so that alarms for both low and high water levels cannot be set off in the control room at the dressing plant, but have to be set off at the recirculation water gate.Useful references: Dam failure at the Aitik mine: Investigations, conclusions and measures taken."

Restoration cost is cost of replacement equipment.\nEstablishment losses - material max euro: 5900000Establishment losses - response max euro: 5300000Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Operators shut-down the plant and shut-off the fuel supply. 4 people of the company fire brigade provided to extinguish the fire. The decontamination of plant started.Emergency measures - Remarks: On site fire team and plant personnel extinguished fire and shut off fuel supply to fire (refinery treat gas).Discussion about response: The incident occurred during the activation of a platinum catalyst using refinery treat gas and had several causes. 1. Catalyst activation was not taken into account during the reactor design. 2. A high temperature trip device was not provided. 3. The original risk assessment did not consider the catalyst activation stage and dismissed the possibility of a runaway exothermic reaction.4. During initial plant start-up in 1991 and catalyst activation at 400 degrees Celsius an exotherm was experienced, the cause was identified as hydro cracking of parafins in the treat gas but no further action was taken. 5. In 1994 during a preliminary hot de-waxed treatment at 430 degrees Celsius, temperature indicators were seen to be out of range. No investigation was made. The settings of the temperature indicators was 410 and 450 Celsius although the instruments had a potential maximum of 1000 Celsius. All alarms were set at 405 Celsius. 6. The reactor installation was provided with an emergency shut-down control which was manually activated and required operators to respond correctly to the situation. 7. In May 1994 a new catalyst was to be activated. Temperature 430 Celsius was planned, there was no risk assessment on this change in operating conditions. The first activation was done at 400 Celsius. Refinery change procedures called for a review if there were significant changes in operating conditions but no review was carried out. 8. During the activation stage 3 people went out onto the reactor ladders and platforms at various times, if they had been present when the reactor ruptured they would have been caught by the fire. 9. The causes of the incident can be summed up as follows: &nbsp; (1) Failure to understand the processes occurring in the reactor and the effect of an increase in temperature on the rate of exothermic reactions. &nbsp; (2) Inadequate cooling facilities. &nbsp; (3) An inadequate control system and the absence of a high temperature trip device. &nbsp; (4) Inadequate operational procedures and training of managers, engineers and operators.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the plant was shut-down and the reactor purged. Its contents was removed and the reactor was prepared to open it to allow an internal examination.\n\nIt was found that the temperature indicators on reactor had maximum readings below expected temperatures. Besides, no high temperature trips were fitted.Useful references: very little published information on runaway exotherm in continuous reactors. Case report in Safety Digest of American Petroleum institute, Publication 758 Section 2 1979 Capter 5 is similar to this incident. Also \"Chemical Reaction Hazards - A Guide\" Editors Barton and Rogers published by IChemEng 1993 and IChemSymposium Series No. 85 \"Protection of Exothermic Reactors and Pressurised Storage Vessels\". Hydro cracking and thermal cracking of parafins at the temperatures experienced in this reactor are widely reported in standard text books."

        "Causes of the accident": "Due to the failure of the safety systems, pentane first leaked into the manhole of the pump and then into the inspection manholes of the underground tanks. When the damage was detected, the manholes of the pump and of the underground tanks were already filled with pentane; pentane had already reached the pavement of courtyard and evaporated. Apparently a part of the pentane had penetrated directly into the ground in correspondence with the tanks through fissures between the manholes of the underground tanks and their collars.\nAccording to the information given by the company, about 14.000 litres of n-pentane are missing. It is difficult to estimate how much of it evaporated and how much penetrated in the ground. According to the investigation and to the measurements, it has to be assumed that several thousand litres of pentane penetrated in the ground.\n\nOn 1/03/00 a release of Pentane occurred on a feeding pipe of a foam production plant.During normal operation of the installation, a leak occurred in a corrugated hose connecting a pump to the fixed piping.The gas detection system apparently did not respond or, at least, according to the declarations of the employees, no acoustic or optical alarm was perceived. The pump did not switch off automatically even with 40% LEL of pentane gas.Due to the failure of the safety systems, pentane was released without being detected in the pump manhole and, from there, it diffused into the inspection manholes of the underground tanks connected to the pump manhole.When the damage was detected, the pump manhole and the manholes of the underground tanks were already filled with pentane; pentane had already reached the pavement of courtyard and evaporated. Apparently a part of the pentane had penetrated directly into the ground in correspondence with the tanks through fissures between the manholes of the underground tanks and their collars.According to the information given by the company, about 14.000 litres of n-pentane are missing. It is difficult to estimate how much of it evaporated and how much penetrated into the ground. According to the investigation and to the measurements, it has to be assumed that several thousand litres of pentane penetrated into the ground.Accident causeAn excessive load on the corrugated hose or an eventual material defect of the hose may be the probable causes of this accident. The damaged corrugated hose was exactly fitted (exact length) between the transfer pump and the fixed piping. The lifting movement of the pump exposed the corrugated hose to a continuous mechanical strain. The substitution of the corrugated hose was scheduled once a year and the hose concerned had been operating for 8 months.The gas-sensor had not been damaged by the release and it was perfectly functional.",
        "Consequences": "not given",
        "Emergency response": "not given",
        "Lesson Learned": "- The substitution cycles of the corrugated hoses will be redefined with the appointed expert.- The length of corrugated hoses will not be longer an exact fit.- A redundant safety system including a leakage probe (5 cm above the pump manhole bottom) and a gas-sensor (10 cm above the pump manhole bottom) will be installed in the manhole of the pump.- The exact accident cause will be investigated by the appointed expert and the whole installation will be checked&nbsp; by an expert. During the check up the integrity of the corrosion protection of the underground tanks will have to be checked.On the premises of the installation a soil-air restoration was started. The spatial extension and the size of the soil contamination is being investigated through test boring.&nbsp; Wells and channels in the potentially exposed area are constantly monitored for pentane. Up to now, pentane has not been detected in the wells and channels."

        "Finish Date": "1992-02-01 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The plant was producing trichloro-trifluoroethane (Arcton 113) by reacting carbon tetrachloride with chlorine and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride in presence of a catalyst. Crude gases leaving the reaction section undergo a series of stripping and separation processes to separate the trichloro-trifluoroethane from by-products and unreacted raw materials. The failed pipe was in this downstream part of the plant. The failure occurred 2 hours after the plant start-up.The chronology of the accident was as follows:18:05: the leak was detected by a plant operator and the plant shut-down was initiated;18:10: the chlorine stripper was isolated from the reactor;18:30: the pipe was isolated at the cooler inlet and the fire brigade was called;18:35: water sprays were set up downwind the leak;18:45: an off-site chlorine concentration of 0.5-1.0 ppm was detected;18:50: the major off-site emergency plan was activated;19:30: the emission rate was reduced to half and the source leak was identified;20:30: the works to clamp the hole in the pipe was initiated;21:35: the leak was sealed;21:45: the emergency services were stand down.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:\nThe failure of the 2\" monel pipe connecting the chlorine stripper boiler and the phase separator cooler of the chlorine stripping section allowed the release of liquid/vapour mixture under pressure. The released liquid/vapour mixture was toxic, containing hydrogen fluoride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride and trichloro-trifluoroethane.\nCAUSES:\nThe 2\" monel pipe failed due to internal corrosion. The rate of corrosion was about 3 times that expected but the researches and the trials that have been made have not identified the causes of this behaviour. However, underlying causes should have been inadequate process analysis, pipe design and testing procedures.",

All were treated at the site medical center. Outside the establishment about 2,500 people, up to 1.5 km from the source of the leak, were confined to their homes for about 2 hours.1 lady who drove through the cloud with a car was reported to the local hospital with minor eyes irritation. 1 pregnant lady was reported to the the hospital because of concern for the baby but no effects were found.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:About 2,500 people off-site, up to 1.5 km from the source of the leak, were confined to their homes for about 2 hours.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA:The extent of the effects is shown on a map attached to the Original Report. In this map, the points were the chlorine measurements had been carried out are highlighted in yellow.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The on-site major emergency plan was activated and the plant was shut-down using control systems. The leak section was isolated and the failed pipe was fitted with a temporary patch. The internal emergency teams were activated and water sprays used to knock down vapours and to dilute the spillage (washed to effluent treatment plant). About thirty appliances were deployed during the accident.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The off-site major emergency plan was activated but little action was required as no real off-site effects. Gas detection was carried out in a North East direction from the release point. Approximately 2,500 people were advised to stay in their homes.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).Official action taken - other official action: When the Original Report was prepared, a Prohibition Notice served to prevent the operation of the plant until the investigations have not been completed and any remedial measures (that the investigations showed to be necessary) have fully implemented. In any case, the plant may not operate again because, due to the Montreal Protocol about the ChloroFluoroCarbons, it has to be closed soon.",

One pipe on another plant had to be monitored regularly for the limited remaining life of the plant itself. Actually, all the \"registered\" pipework (that is all the pipework where a major accident hazard could be expected), have to be periodically inspected. In future, all the pipework where the consequences of a failure are unacceptable, irrespective of the failure mechanism, will be subjected to inspection procedures."

But unknown to the service personnel the blowpipe of the oleum stockage vessel was blocked by crystalline SO3, so inside the vessel pressure was generated. Thereby the liquid oleum (SO3) was first squeezed, through the bottom blow valve, in a climb piping and from there directly to an absorption vessel with ammonium sulphate. Through the contact of oleum with the absorption metal a large amount of sulphur trioxide (SO3) was released. Due to the strong heat development a contemporary rupture of one gas pipe occurred such that Oleum invaded directly the plant and from there to the outside (about 500 kg SO3).",

        "Start Date": "2018-09-13 14:35:00",
        "Finish Date": "2018-09-13 14:50:00",
        "Accident Description": "On 13 September 2018 at around 14.37, an explosion took place, followed by a very brief localised fire at the North discharge pit. The explosion took place during the discharge of liquid waste from a tanker into the North discharge pit. The discharge pit is a concrete underground tank covered with a concrete lid. The remains of a previous discharge were present in the discharge pit. When the waste materials mixed with each other, a reaction occurred leading to the generation of oxygen, which formed an explosive mixture together with the solvents contained in the discharge pit. Further investigation showed that 3 possible scenarios regarding the ignition source can be considered. It is not possible to say with absolute certainty what the actual source of ignition was.",
        "Causes of the accident": "During the transfer from the tanker into the discharge pit, at the time of the accident, an explosive atmosphere formed. The investigation into possible ignition sources shows that there are three possible scenarios.\n\n\u2014 Ignition source in the discharge pit\n\u2014 Ignition source in the vicinity of the discharge pit\n\u2014 Ignition from the furnace\n\nThe various scenarios and their likelihood are briefly explained below.\nIgnition source within the discharge pit. \nGases having a self-ignition temperature of around 200 \u00b0C were present in the discharge pit. &nbsp;However, the self-ignition temperature lowers in an oxygen rich environment. &nbsp;Assuming a halving then the self-ignition temperature may have been lowered to 100 \u00b0C. &nbsp;However, the temperature switch present in the discharge pit, was not activated before the explosion, which implies that the temperature in the discharge pit remained below its setpoint of 90 \u00b0C. &nbsp;\nDue to the oxygen formation, foam was generated in the discharge pit, which could have led to an electrostatic discharge. Due to the higher oxygen concentration in the discharge pit, also the ignition energy of the products is lowered. &nbsp;If this is being considered a possible source of ignition, it remains unclear why the explosion occurred 10 minutes after the discharge started, while after 3 minutes the oxygen concentration already represented more than 50% in the discharge pit. &nbsp;Furthermore, the foam is formed by a product with good conductivity.\nThis scenario is considered unlikely.\nIgnition source nearby the discharge pit\nHereby the possibility is investigated that the explosive mixture ignited outside the discharge pit. It should be noted that the zone surrounding the discharge pit is classified as zone 2, which implies that the installations present therein, do not constitute an ignition source during normal operation. &nbsp;From the pressure measurements, it appears that the pressure in the displacement gas network remained below 16 mbar. &nbsp;This pressure is too low to open the pressure relief valve on the discharge pit. The pressure relief valve is set to 18 mbar. &nbsp;At some point, a pressure decrease is observed, but this is too slow to be due to the venting of the pressure relief valve. &nbsp;The pressure profile of the pressure reduction, with a pressure decrease which is slower at the beginning than at the end, also does not indicate the venting of a pressure relief valve. &nbsp;On the other hand, one can think that a pressure increase in the displacement gas network has caused one rusted section of the pipework to fail. &nbsp;After the explosion indeed, at some places in the displacement gas network holes were found in the pipes. Further metallurgical investigation showed that the piping still had a sufficient thickness to resist against the pressure increase before the explosion.&nbsp;\nThis scenario is considered unlikely.\nIgnition from the furnace\nThe pipeline to the furnace, during the minutes before the explosion, was filled with a mixture that systematically has become richer in oxygen. &nbsp;In addition, at the time of the accident also a discharge was ongoing on discharge pit South. While pumping from the discharge pit into tank V11010, &nbsp;vapours from this tank, containing toluene vapours were pushed in the pipelines of the displacement gas network. &nbsp;As this is the same pipeline, it is certainly possible to have formed a flammable mixture. &nbsp;This mixture could have been ignited in the furnace, so it is possible that the flame ran against the flow back. &nbsp;&nbsp;\nHowever, the flame arrestor, present in this pipe should have ensured that the flame was stopped. &nbsp;According to the company, there are two scenarios that can explain why the flame arrestor may not have worked:\n\nSuch flame arrestor may fail when the oxygen concentration is higher than 40%. &nbsp;Higher oxygen concentration will increase the flame speed.\nA flame arrestor ensures that the hot combustion gases cool down within the fine mesh of the flame arrestor. &nbsp;If this occurs several times then the flame arrestor can become too warm to function properly\n\nWhen the flame has passed the flame arrestor it can further propagate towards tanks and discharge pits. &nbsp;Because of the high oxygen concentration, the flame speed can reach more than 100 m/s, and will travel in a short time to the intersection of the pipelines to the tanks and the pipelines to the discharge pits. &nbsp;In the pipelines to the tanks, the flame will extinguish due to lack of oxygen. &nbsp;The concentration of oxygen that has flowed previously from the discharge pit North towards the tanks is rather limited.&nbsp; The flame will propagate further towards the discharge pits. &nbsp;Here is a higher oxygen concentration and probably sufficient combustible gases. &nbsp;Due to the increased oxygen concentration, the flame propagation will be very fast.&nbsp; In the pipeline to the discharge pit South, the flame will extinguish due to a lack of oxygen (analogous reasoning as for the tanks), but in the discharge pit North, on the contrary the flame can cause an explosion.&nbsp; The rise to 3 mbar at the level of PT901 (furnace), about 10 s before the explosion which can be caused by a first ignition in the displacement gas network line, stopped by the flame arrestor. Also consistent with an ignition from the furnace is that pressure gauge PT90009 which is the furthest from the furnace in the lines, doesn\u2019t show the same pressure increase as the other pressure gauges during the explosion.\nSo ignition from the furnace is considered the most likely ignition source.",
        "Consequences": "The explosion destroyed the discharge pit and caused enormous damage to the transfer station. Moreover, one operator died as a result of the explosion and four other persons were slightly injured. These slight injuries were caused by a pressure wave and by flying debris. The slightly injured persons have fully recovered. One of the persons who was slightly injured is the operator who helped the person who was killed to perform the operations for connecting a pump. He was injured by flying debris. The other victims are drivers who were present in the vicinity of the discharge pits. Two discharge pits (North and South) are present on the site and are located close to each other. Two of these drivers were by their tanker, which was being unloaded at that time. Each tanker is unloaded into a different discharge pit. In addition, another driver was passing by the discharge pits at the time of the explosion. He is thought to have been carrying his papers and passed by just as the explosion occurred. The drivers involved suffered temporary damage to their hearing as well as injuries caused by flying debris.\n4 persons who suffered hearing damage and slight injuries from flying debris.",
        "Emergency response": "The explosion was followed by a short fire, which was extinguished by the company\u2019s intervention team. The cut-off supply of nitrogen to the transfer station was also sealed off. The slightly injured victims were taken to hospital for examination.The firm\u2019s intervention team carried out the intervention.Injured victims were taken to hospital.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Even if a substance is not classified as oxidising, the presence of peroxides, even at low concentrations, can lead to the formation of oxygen during reactions with other substances.\nAfter the accident, the firm tightened up its acceptance procedures for waste products. This includes more extensive mixing testing of all waste products that are discharged together into a storage tank.\nFollowing the accident it was decided to stop using the discharge pits. Waste products that are still authorised to be stored in tanks after the stricter tests are discharged directly into tanks. If an explosion occurs in a conventionally designed vertical storage tank, normally only the cover becomes detached due to a weak weld between the wall and the cover. The risk of someone being on the cover at that time is much smaller.\nA flame arrester is not a suitable means for preventing re-ignition in the event of continuous or repeated ignition. The flame arrester must therefore be equipped with a temperature detector. If the flame arrester heats up, the pipe can be shut off by a valve to prevent the flame reigniting.\nThe flame arrester must also be periodically inspected, as contamination can also cause flames to pass through a flame arrester."

        "Accident Description": "As a result of a power dip a number of pumps stopped and disrupted the operation of the MOGAS plant (which produces iso-octane, a key blending component of petrol). The relief valve on one of the vessels lifted and a fracture followed on the weld of a small bore thermocouple off-take, leading to the release of propane gas to atmosphere. The leak source was isolated by an employee wearing breathing apparatus, the vessel depressurised to flare and the gas cloud dispersed quickly.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Power dip. Also, examination of the failed section showed that failure resulted from cracking of the root weld of a thermowell boss, most likely due to severe vibration. The vibration may have resulted from either the lifting of the relief valve or hammer from the pump start-up. A number of actions were taken.",
        "Consequences": "Release of propane gas to atmosphere",
        "Emergency response": "The leak source was isolated by an employee wearing breathing apparatus, the vessel depressurised to flare and the gas cloud dispersed quickly.",
        "Lesson Learned": "It is important to identify all of the potential integrity failure mechanisms and ensure appropriate inspection and management processes are in place. This can be achieved through a structured integrity program, such as the Risk Based Inspection program being implemented at Geelong Refinery, The potential for vibration to be an integrity failure mechanism must be understood by all personnel so that incidents involving severe vibration are reported and investigated promptly.Further measures:The pump control system was reviewed with a view to minimise hydraulic \u2018hammer\u2019. Vibration analysis of the piping was undertaken to verify design. The piping was redesigned to replace the thermoboss with a reducing tee and improve support/bracing. Start-up and shutdown procedures were reviewed to ensure water washing is carried out prior to steaming and to ensure caustic stress cracking does not occur."

        "Accident Description": "ENVIRONMENT AND ATMOSPHERICAL CONDITIONS:The wind direction was variable between East-North-East and East-South-East. The wind velocity was about 5 mph (2.2 m/sec). It was a sunny day.An iron-chlorine fire developped during stress relieving by heat treatment at 400\u00b0C of a tanker padding line. As a result of the iron-chlorine fire, the pipeline was destroyed and a few hundreds kilograms of chlorine were released to the atmosphere.The chlorine detection system warned operators who put on self-contained breathing apparatuses and isolated the storage tank using remotely operated shut-off valves.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:The release of chlorine occurred because of the damage of the padding line from chlorine bulk storage tank to road tanker unloading. The line was damaged by an iron-chlorine fire developped during the stress relieving by heat treatment at 400\u00b0C. The accident is mainly attributed to the confusion in the issue of permit to work. The issuer thought that another pipeline was to be heat-treated, whereas the counter-signer assumed that isolations instituted earlier for pipeline replacement were still in place. The system of work-permit was, in any case, inadequate (code 5303).",
        "Consequences": "MATERIAL LOSS:A piece (12\" long) of the 2\" pipeline from the bulk chlorine storage tank to the road tanker unloading point was destroyed by the iron-chloride fire.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX DENSITY OF POPULATION:A chlorine concentration of 0.3 ppm in air was detected at 500 metres to the West from the establishment (on a map attached to the Original Report is shown the wind direction when the accident occurred).

        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The chlorine detection system warned the operators who put on self-contained breathing apparatuses and isolated the storage tank using remotely operated shut-off valves. The adjacent manufacturing plant was evacuated. To control the dispersion of the toxic cloud water curtain were used.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The chlorine concentration in air outside the factory's boundaries was monitored. A chlorine concentration of 0.3 ppm was detected at 500 m to the West.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident the review of the system of work-permits was established because the existing procedures were insufficient.Measures to mitigate consequences: The damaged pipework was replaced with another one with the same characteristics."

        "Finish Date": "2001-04-16 17:20:00",
        "Accident Description": "Saturate Gas Plant, de-ethaniser column overhead line failure resulting in an inventory loss greater than the 5% Shedule 1 threshold for extremely flammable gases. The escaping gas formed a vapour cloud which subsequently exploded.A catastrophic failure occurred on a section of pipework on the Saturate Gas Plant (SGP), at an elbow just downstream of a water-into-gas injection point. The 6 inch diameter pipe (the overhead line carrying flammable gas under high pressure) ruptured releasing a huge cloud containing around 90% ethane/propane/butane. About 20-30 seconds later the gas cloud ignited, resulting in a massive explosion and fire.The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf",
        "Causes of the accident": "The primary cause of the explosion was the erosion/corrosion of the 6 inch diameter pipe which carried the overhead line from the De-ethaniser to the Heat Exchanger in the Saturate Gas Plant (SGP). The failure occurred downstream of, and in close proximity to, a water injection point that was not part of the original design.Examination of the failed elbow of the pipework showed that it had failed due to an 'erosion/corrosion' damage mechanism which, over time, had reduced the wall thickness at the outside of the elbow to such an extent that the wall could no longer withstand the internal pressure within the pipe. The wall thickness had been reduced from around 7-8mm to a minimum of 0.3mm. When the pipe failed, it burst open catastrophically,causing a 'full-bore' type of release of the pipe's contents.Metallurgical examination of the pipe revealed that the uncorroded sections of the pipe were internally coated with black iron slphide, known as the 'passivation' layer which, once formed, serves to protect the carbon steel material from further corrosion. However, when the water injection was in operation it washed away the protective coating leaving it open to attack by corrosive agents in the gas stream. Hence the elbow was subject to erosion/corrosion, a process that resulted in the thinning of the pipe wall and eventual failure.The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf",
        "Consequences": "Area concerned - remarks:The Saturate Gas Plant (SGP) suffered very heavy damage as a result of the force of the blast. Fortunately no one had been in the direct path of the the estimated 175 x 80 metres gas cloud when it exploded. The resultant fire caused further and substantial damage to the SGP. Other buildings on the refinery, up to 400 metres away from the source of the explosion, were badly damaged.The refinery was shut down completely for several weeks following the explosion, followed by a phased start up.An adjacent oil refinery also sustained damage to buildings, although the process plant was unaffected.The explosion caused widespread damage to houses and businesses within a 1km radius of the site. Around 370 individual reports were made of damage to buildings, mainly broken windows and cracks to ceilings and walls. There is evidence of residents suffering shock and distress by the blast, although they were not injured. 71 civil claims for injury damage are being pursued by members of the public.Debris from the explosion was spread over a wide area. It littered a nearby road to the extent that emergency services had to slow down to negotiate their way through it. Some debris, mainly cladding, was thrown into the air and found betwen 500 metres and 5km away.People - remarks:The incident occurred on a public holiday (Easter Monday) when there were only 185 people on site, rather than the normal number of about 800. One minor on-site injury, two superficial off-site injuries. The explosion caused widespread damage to houses and businesses within a 1km radius of the site. Around 370 individual reports were made of damage to buildings, mainly broken windows and cracks to ceilings and walls. There is evidence of residents suffering shock and distress by the blast, although they were not injured. 71 civil claims by members of the public for injury damage are being pursued.Material Loss - remarks:As well as the material loss mentioned above: Following the HSE investigation into the incident, the company were prosecuted for health and safety breaches and were fined a total of approx 1 million euros with costs of 300,000 euros.Community Disruption:Police closed off roads around the refinery, nearby residents were informed to close windows and remain indoors, ambulances were summoned to the site and the local Hospital instigated its major incident procedure. An adjacent oil refinery also sustained damage to buildings, although the process plant was unaffected.Debris from the explosion was spread over a wide area. It littered a nearby road to the extent that responding emergency services had to slow down to negotiate their way through it. Some debris, mainly cladding, was thrown into the air and found between 500 metres and 5km away.The incident received local and national press coverage.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local",
        "Emergency response": "Emergency measures - Remarks: The ConocoPhillips Emergency Response Team led the fire-fightiing effort with the Humberside Fire Service attending; fire crew from an adjacent oil refinery also assisted them as part of the existing mutual aid scheme. \n\nThe incident occurred at 14.21 hours and the refinery general alarm was sounded shortly afterwards. At 14.40 the refinery was shut down because the fire appeared to be out of control. By approximately 15.30 the fire was under control and it was largely extinguished by 17.10 and recorded by the Humberside Fire Service as 'struck out' at 21.01 hours.\n\nThe off-site emergency alarm (Community Alarm) was not sounded at any point during the incident. ConocoPhillips view is that this off-site emergency alarm is only used for foreseen toxic gas releases. The damage caused from the incident was immediate and without warning. The off-site emergency plan was not put into effect. Following the investigation, recommendations were made to improve the procedures for calling the emergency services, and for deciding when, and by whom, the the off-site alarm should be sounded.\n\nIn addition to the Humberside Fire Service, the other emergency services committed significant resources to tackle the incident; Police closed off roads around the refinery, nearby residents were informed to close windows and remain indoors, ambulances were summoned to the site and the local Hospital instigated its major incident procedure. Whilst the property damage in the area was extensive, fortunately there were no serious injuries.\nSeveso II duties  - remarks: Although there was an\noff-site emergency plan for this establishment, it was not initiated in\nresponse to this incident. There was also uncertainty as to who was\nresponsible for calling the emergency services.\nFollowing the investigation it was recommended that:\n\na) the procedures should be reviewed to clarify who calls the emergency\nservices, which services should be contacted and the circumstances\nunder which they should be called. All documents and call lists should\nbe revised as appropriate.\n\nb) the circumstances under which the off-site alarm is to be sounded,\nand the person who has the responsibility to sound it, should be\nclarified, and this should be written in to the emergency on-site\nprocedures.\nOfficial action taken - legal action: Following the investigation into the incident, ConocoPhillips Limited were charged with a number of offences. They pleaded guilty to the charges under Sections 2 and 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, that:a) at the Humber Refinery between 1 January 1996 and 17 April 2001, they did not ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of their employees; and that b) they also failed to conduct the undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable, that&nbsp; persons not in their employment who might thereby be affected, were not exposed to risks to their health and safety.The company were fined \u00a3400,000 on each charge with costs of \u00a3218,854. They were also fined \u00a320,000 for offences concerning pressure systems legislation.Official action taken - other action: HSE served an Improvement Notice on ConocpoPhillips Limited on 1 July 2001 requiring them to draw up an action plan for implementing the provisions of a suitable industry standard for pipework inspections at the refinery and address the corrosion management deficiencies found. This Improvement Notice was complied with.HSE issued a Safety Alert to other UK oil refineries advising them of the need to have effective inspection systems in place around water injection points in process lines, particularly if they are close to bends in the pipework.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: Actions taken:a.The company undertook a piping inspection programme 'Hawkeye' at all the higher risk refinery piping systems. This was essentially a Risk Based Inspection review and as a result approximately 3,200 lines were inspected - about 15% of the total refinery system. Another project 'Project 570' was initiated to review the remaining 85% of refinery piping, and 62,000 inspection locations were reviewed, following the guidance in the American Institute Piping Inspection Code API 570, covering the inspection, repair alteration and re-rating of in-service piping systems.b. ConocoPhillips senior management requested a third party audit of all their facilities worldwide, both upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining and marketing). This was conducted by specialist consultants with a worldwide reputation in the field of process safety.c. The refinery organisational structure was revised to provide clearer definitions of the responsibilities for mechanical integrity. Inspection and mechanical integrity and their associated actions are key risk control activities, and the monitoring of their performance metrics are reviewed routinely by the refinery leadership team. Conclusions and lessons learned:a. Management of pipework inspectionConocoPhillips failed to implement an effective system for the inspection of pipework on the Saturate Gas Plant (SGP), to complement that in place for process equipment. The system fell far below recognised industry good practice at the time.&nbsp; In addition they failed to use knowledge and experience from other sections of the plant that should have identified the need for more inspection of the SGP pipework. Over time sufficient pipework condition data should have been obtained, and entered onto an inspection database, to verify the believed integrity and inform assessments of future inspection requirements. Without this both the system and the assessments were inadequate.Key lessons:- Effective pipework inspection systems are a vital major accident prevention measure for high hazard pipework.- Such systems should at least meet current industry good practice standard- Decisions on inspection intervals should be informed by suitable and sufficient information on process conditions and previous inspection findings.b. Management of changeThe design and installation of the water injection point in the pipe was not subject to any management of change assessment. Had such an assessment been carried out, the corrosion risk that the injection point introduced for the downstream pipework could have been identified. Similarly no assessment was made of the changes in the use of the water injection point, between continuous and intermittent, over the lifetime of the plant. The frequency of use was a major factor in the rate of the corrosion of the pipework. During periods of continued use more frequent or detailed inspections of the pipework should have taken place to adequately monitor the integrity of the pipe.Key lessons:- Effective management of change systems, which consider both plant and process modifications, are essential to prevent major accidents.- Particular care is needed to ensure that 'quick fix' modifications, during the commissioning and early operation phases of new plant, are covered.c. Management of corrosionConocoPhillips corrosion management on the SGP was not sufficiently thorough or systematic to prevent the failure of the pipe. Some positive actions were taken, including the appointment of a full-time corrosion engineer for the refinery, the introduction of divisional corrosion reviews and monitoring of process streams by sampling, and the installation of corrosion probes, following receipt of specific information in 1992 about the vulnerability of carbon steel pipework in the vicinity of water injection points. Unfortunately these activities were allowed to lapse with the result that there was both insufficient data on, and inadequate resource or focus applied to, corrosion as a potential major accident initiator on the SGP.Key lessons:- Systematic and thorough arrangements are necessary for the effective management of corrosion on major hazard installations.- Such arrangements should ensure that any available information on relevant corrosion degradation mechanisms is identified and acted on.- Adequate resource, including relevant expertise, should be applied to ensure that adequate standards are achieved and maintained.d. CommunicationTwo significant communication failings contributed to this incident. Firstly the various changes to the frequency of use of of the water injection point were not communicated outside plant operations personnel. As a result there was a belief elsewhere that it was in occasional use only and did not constitute a corrosion risk. Secondly, information from the injection point inspection, which was carried out in 1994, was not adequately recorded or communicated, with the result that the recommended further inspections of the pipe were never carried out.These failings were confirmed in a subsequent detailed inspection of specific human factors issues at the refinery. Safety communications were found to be largely 'top-down' instructions related to personal safety issues, rather than seeking to involve the workforce in the active prevention of major accidents. The inspection identified that there was insufficient attention on the refinery to the management of process safety.Key lessons:&nbsp;- Effective communication is an important element of any safety management system. In the context of major hazard establishments the accurate recording and effective sharing of information and data relevant to plant corrosion is essential for major accident prevention.- Communication systems should aim to actively involve the workforce in the prevention of major accidents as part of an adequately resourced process safety management system.Measures to mitigate consequences: Specialist consultants were employed to review the blast damage and explosion over-pressure calculations to improve predictive knowledge. Software used to predict explosion over-pressure was updated and used for all the Humber refinery occupied building risk assessments.Recommendations were made to improve the procedures for calling the emergency services, and for deciding when, and by whom, the the off-site alarm should be sounded.Lessons from the emergency response on-site and off-site were shared with local industries, emergency planning and the emergency services through the local Major Hazards Group. A process was set up to handle concerns among the community and to carry out repairs in a timely fashion. An additional off-site community alarm was installed to cover South Killingholme residents furthest away from the refinery who could not always hear the existing alarm.Useful references: The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf"

        "Accident Description": "In a building of an aeronautical equipment factory classified as 'Seveso higher tier', a block of propellant caught fire at 7.45, during 'demoulding'. This manual operation, which is carried out with three operators, is a finishing stage that consists in removing the blocks of propellant that remain attached to the dies used in propellant manufacture.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "Several investigations have been carried out in order to determine the cause of the ignition, as well as the stage of operations in question. The propellant is sensitive to electrostatic charges, shocks and friction. No anomalies were detected during the casting that preceded the demoulding operation.",
        "Consequences": "The three members of staff present in the facility were severely burned. One of them died the following morning of his injuries. The facility in question was seriously damaged and rendered unusable - the light-weight roof was damaged, building blocks collapsed, the main door was blown out, structural steel components and interior equipment were deformed. However, no damage was identified beyond the building itself.",
        "Emergency response": "Alerted by the cries of the victims and by several alarms that had been set off from within the facility, the site rescue service arrived immediately and called for assistance from external emergency services.\nThe victims were given first aid and were then transferred to the nearest hospital. The fire was quickly brought under control by the fire fighters. The factory's manufacturing of pyrotechnic substances was stopped, and such activities did not resume until the cause of the accident had been determined.\n",
        "Lesson Learned": "An incident occurred involving another type of propellant in another building in February 2006. This led to improvements in safety as well as the partial automation of operations. In generalising the feedback, these improvements were applied in a preventive manner to workplaces possessing similar risks, such as that involved in the accident, in order to minimise operators' exposure to the risk of direct contact with pyrotechnic substances. The handling operation that was underway at the moment of the accident was, however, a manual operation."

        "Causes of the accident": "The accident occurred during drying. The dryer was washed with water, this procedure finishing at about 10.30. The next operation was to be the draining of the reservoir (containing water from the dryer) into the acid drain for final treatment. Because one of the plates of the dryer was broken, and the dryer was not therefore functioning correctly, the quantity of 2-azo-bis-methylburtyronitrile in this reservoir was greater than normal. The reservoir was 2/3 full. The operator expected some difficulties in draining the reservoir, and so heated the water using a flexible steam pipe (128\u00b0C). This manoeuvre lasted 15 minutes. The normal rinsing temperature is 40\u00b0C, since the product is unstable above 50\u00b0C. After a delay of some 20 minutes, the product decayed until it forced the top off the reservoir in an explosion. The cover, fixed by 50 bolts, was torn off, while the bolts and nuts remained intact. The combustion gases then spread round the installation and caught fire. The combustion produced large deposits of carbon black.",
        "Consequences": "There was damage to the equipment involved: reservoir, dryer, filter, etc. and also to the inflammable materials in the installation: plastic, electric cables, PVC tubes, duckboards etc. No-one was hurt because the accident occurred during shift change (11.45-12.00).

Therefore the acid content in the wash water in a part of the flue gas system increased strongly. The wash water must then have formed big drops on the way between the washer and the chimney mouth. These drops did not evaporate completely to the atmosphere due to their size and the weather conditions at the time of the incident, and fell down as drop emission in the immediate vicinity of our installation.",
        "Causes of the accident": "INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:A section of the water distribution unit was loose and through thisan emission of droplets from theflue gas chimney took place. As a consequence the plants, both crops and ornamental ones, in the area around the installation were etched.Causes:As cause of the emission of droplets it was been established that a failure occurred in the washer of waste boiler no 3 for domestic waste. This failure consisted of a loose section of the water distribution floor of the washer. Probably due to a material failure this section could become loose over an area of about 1/4 square meter. The final report from experts is not yet available. The information available in this moment does allow the conclusion that there is no long term damage to the environment, animals or human beings. Furthermore may it already be concluded that contact with plants and soil polluted by the drop emission does not pose any acute health problems.",

        "Lesson Learned": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Immediately after establishing the damage to the scrubber the loose section was changed with a new one. Furthermore all sections of the scrubber floor were tested to confirm that they were not loose and in good conditions. As a precaution also the scrubbers of the other incinerators for domestic waste were checked. The affected scrubber will be definitively put out of service at the end of 1993. Until then this scrubber will be controlled regularly and the water distribution floor will be renewed completely. This should ensure that there are no more emissions of droplets.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENTAt the moment a new flue-gas purification plant is under construction. To this new unit the three incinerators for domestic waste will be connected. The new flue-gas units will be so equipped that drop emission is no more to be feared. At the end of 1993 the three incinerators for domestic waste will be connected to the new flue-gas unit."

        "Accident Description": "Fire in an intermediate storage facility for special waste.On 22&nbsp;May 2011, at around 23.00, there was a fire in an intermediate storage facility for special waste. A warehouse of around 2&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2 consisting of an unprotected steel structure was virtually destroyed, but did not collapse. As regards the spreading of the fire and destruction, it is worth noting that current evidence suggests that the fire started in a covered outdoor storage area, possibly in several places, and then spread to the special storage rooms inside the covered area, in spite of the rooms being separated for fire protection purposes.  The search for the cause of the fire is still ongoing.  Safety measures: - Triggering of the fire alarm system - Triggering of the CO2 extinguishing system - Fire watch",
        "Causes of the accident": "The Land Criminal Police Office assumes that it is a case of arson.",
        "Consequences": "- Damage to buildings - Damage to stackers and shredders",
        "Emergency response": "- Fire watch - Surveillance by security firm - Clearing and cleaning of the intermediate storage facility - Controlled fire extinction - Measuring concentration of pollutants",
        "Lesson Learned": "It should be noted that there were no mandatory standards for fire safety requirements to be met by large roofs at the time the warehouse was planned and built (the standard DIN 18 234-2, for example, was not made mandatory until 1995; guidelines on the construction of industrial buildings did not then contain any specific requirements for roofs).  In future, when planning reconstruction or restoration work, the specific risk situation in the case of fire should be taken into account in addition to the requirements which must in any case be complied with.  The following points should be considered: 1. The basic separation of storage rooms for fire protection purposes must be maintained and the rooms must continue to be fitted with automatic fire alarms and extinguishing systems. 2. Taking into account the potential damage/effects caused by a fire in the storage rooms, the storage rooms should be designed as fire compartments separate from the adjacent outdoor storage areas, even if the hall would be admissible as a fire compartment according to the guidelines on the construction of industrial buildings. The walls separating the storage rooms from the adjacent areas are to be designed as fire walls and must therefore be raised to 0.50&nbsp;m above the roof. 3. Regardless of whether the above recommendation on the formation of fire compartments is followed, the requirements of DIN 18 234 are to be implemented due to the particular risks involved in rebuilding the roof, even if the roof area is less than 2&nbsp;500&nbsp;m\u00b2. Specific requirements for the construction of roofs only apply to roofs of more than 2&nbsp;500&nbsp;m\u00b2 according to the guidelines on the construction of industrial buildings. This is important because, even if the storage room area is designed as a separate fire compartment, unless specific measures are taken when designing the roof, a fire in one of the storage rooms could spread to the other storage rooms via the roof. 4. Light domes and/or smoke and heat extraction systems in the storage rooms are to be checked in accordance with the specifications of automatic extinguishing systems. 5. Furthermore, the new warehouse must be planned in accordance with TRGS (Technical Rule for Hazardous Substances) 800 \u2018Fire Protection Measures\u2019, adopted in December 2010, the main purpose of which is to protect employees. 6. Although arson cannot always be avoided, checks should be carried out to see whether the covered, freely accessible areas on site can be protected against unauthorised access when the facility is not in operation.  With regard to fire safety requirements, a fire protection expert should be involved in planning the rebuilding of the warehouse."

        "Start Date": "2013-03-26 04:05:00",
        "Finish Date": "2013-03-26 04:30:00",
        "Accident Description": "The accident occurred in a building in which propellent powders for ammunition with ADR classification UN1.3C are sieved. Sieving is one of the final processes in the manufacture of propellant powders. The sieving unit in question comprises two circular sieves positioned in series within a cylindrical housing made from stainless steel. The cylindrical housing is vibrated by forced oscillation and the spherical powder to be sieved is fed into the unit via a mobile hopper moved by hoist apparatus. At the machine outlet, after sorting according to grain size, the useable powders are retrieved in collection hoppers and waste is collected in suitable bags. In principle, the sieving apparatus operates automatically without an operator being present in the sieving hall. The operators fill the feed hoppers and empty the processed product from the collection hoppers when the machine is shut down. On the day of the accident, two operators were assigned to the sieving plant: a young employee on a short-term contract, still in training and an experienced operator in charge of training him. On 26\u00a0March 2013, the operators' first action was to dismantle and reassemble the sieving plant, as laid down in the operating procedure, with a view to cleaning it before starting the actual sieving of the powder. At around 4 a.m., a malfunction occurred in the sieving plant and a fire broke out in the machine which then spread to all the powder located in the sieving unit. The most experienced operator was in the room at that time (his attention had probably been drawn to a suspicious noise). The alarm was set off and the ultrafast-response flooding and sprinkler systems were triggered. Nonetheless, the fire spread to a second 250\u00a0kg hopper of powder which the second operator was bringing to the entrance to the room, and this generated a second fireball. Lastly, a third 250\u00a0kg hopper containing powder, probably already filtered, located outside the room and not yet removed to an appropriate storage place, also caught fire, generating a third fireball, which was observed by the witnesses that came to assist the victims. The two operators suffered serious second- and third-degree burns; they were, however, able to exit the building on their own and remained conscious during their transfer to specialised hospitals, where they received appropriate care. Despite this medical attention, in the weeks following the accident both victims died from the effects of their burns.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Observations indicate that the fast-closing fasteners on the sieving unit opened during the sieving process. Since they were no longer tightened in place, the filters shifted out of their housing, causing metal-on-metal friction which - probably - caused the powder to catch fire. The sieving unit's top cover had a confining effect when the powder was burning, leading to a build-up of pressure in the machine and - very probably - a deflagration of the product that would be the cause of the displacement and significant deformation of the cover. At this point, there was a sudden eruption of flames from the sieving unit which burned the operators then in the immediate vicinity of the machine. A nut used to fasten the sieve housing which was found on the floor after the accident shows no sign of being torn off, suggesting that it gradually worked loose during the sieving operations. The operator's presence in the hall could be attributable to his having approached the sieving unit in order to investigate the cause of the problem after becoming aware of some equipment malfunction (the abnormal noise) without shutting down the machine, despite the fact that procedure stipulates that entering the manufacturing hall is not permitted when the equipment is in operation.",
        "Consequences": "In the months following the accident, both operators (the usual experienced operator and a young employee on a short-term contract, in training) died from the consequences of their burns. A third person who had intervened to assist the victims suffered from slight smoke inhalation and was sent to hospital for observation but was discharged on the day of the accident. Material damage to the plant, which was completely destroyed.",
        "Emergency response": "The third victim (who suffered some smoke inhalation) attempted to assist his colleagues and, instead of going to the assembly point when the alarm sounded, entered the building affected and sprayed his colleagues with water, using the fire-fighting equipment he could find.\u00a0 The automatic extinguishing system worked correctly but because the fire started - we assume - inside the machine, the detectors (ultra-fast IR and UV cameras) were not able to detect it quickly enough. The extinguishing system did, however, prevent the fire spreading to a second neighbouring sieving unit.",
        "Lesson Learned": "- Need to improve the sieve hoop fastening to prevent it coming loose from its housing and creating sparks (metal on metal contact). - Need to increase staff awareness of the risks in the manufacturing building to ensure compliance with procedures preventing staff access when machines are operating. - Installation of a presence detector that automatically shuts the installation down as soon as access doors are opened, and total automation of the process of loading powder in the unit."

        "Accident Description": "Wednesday&nbsp;12.10.2016 at&nbsp;16:05 the control room in the plant was informed about an accident in the terminal in connection with work on an H2S-reactor&nbsp;in the water purification unit.\nSince monday 10th there had been operational problems with the H2S-reactor, sludge had accumulated at the bottom of the reactor, and this was being removed by blowing pressurized air to the bottom of the reactor.\nTwo morning shift operators discovered that H2S values on top of the reactor were too high, and communicated this to their colleagues in the shift, but failed to register the information in the shift log, and also forgot to inform about this at the shift handover.\nThe&nbsp;afternoon shift was undermanned, the shift leader was off duty and was replaced with a coordinator from another shift. This coordinator also had other duties on this shift, which was not allowed according to internal procedures, and a third person took over his role, but this was not communicated to the shift. They were als two operators short, and two students who were on a placement program also followed the shift. There was also an operator trainee on the shift. One of the regular operators (operator 1) had been working for many years at a neighbouring plant, but had his second day at work&nbsp;in this plant.&nbsp;\nAt the start of the afternoon shift, the daily tasks were discussed with the coordinator. Blowing the H2S reactor with&nbsp;pressurized air was one of the tasks, and the new operator was given information on how to perform this job. He took with him the trainee and the two placement students to do the job, and was followed by a trained operator (operator 2). The two operators climbed to the top of the reactor, and the trainee and the students were told to wait at ground level, but this was misunderstood and they also climbed to the top of the tank. Entering the top of the tank the two operators felt a strong smell of H2S, but as they had not been told about the high H2S-values during shift handover, they did not bring with them protective equipment. Seconds after the trainee and students had entered the top, one of the students fainted. The new operator reported this to the control room. The control room alarmed both the internal and external rescue services, and the shift coordinator&nbsp;took&nbsp;lead of the internal rescue team. Internal personnel equipped with chemical-diving equipment arrived at the location, and&nbsp;by then the trainee and the second student had managed to climb down from the reactor. Operator 1 had also started to feel bad and climbed dow. He fainted on the way down and landed on a&nbsp;platform, gained consciousness a llittle later and managed to climb down. Operator 2 also felt ill,&nbsp;lost consiousness for a couple of minutes and woke up again on top of the unconsious student. The internal rescue team discovered upon arrival that they had brought one breathing device that did not function, grabbed some spare parts from a first aid kit and climbed to the top of the reactor. One of them had to climb down fairly quickly due to an empty&nbsp;oxygen bottle. It was a hectic situation, with a lot of things going wrong, until the local rescue services arrived at 16:25&nbsp;\nPeople from the internal emergency response team and from the local fire rescue services managed to get the student down, and he was transported by helicopter to the&nbsp;hospital. The four others were sent by ambulance to the hospital.&nbsp;",
        "Causes of the accident": "The cause of the operational problems in the water purification unit&nbsp;is not important here. The authorities investigation looked at how this situation with 5 people being exposed could occure, and concluded the following:\n\nlack of internal control regarding activities, rescources, process and competency.&nbsp;\ninsufficient manning and competency&nbsp;in the new shift\ninsufficient shift handover, important information was not handed over\noperational management of emergency&nbsp;organisation\ninsufficient training in the use of emergency equipment\ninsufficient&nbsp;planning on how to rescue personell from&nbsp;tall structures\nNon functioning radio communication\n",
        "Consequences": "In total five people were sent to hospital. Four of them were discharged after 24 hours, the placement student stayed in hospital for 3 days.\nSince H2S is a very poisonous substance&nbsp;it was pure luck that nobody died, and very&nbsp;fortunate that none of them so far have experienced delayed negative health effects. High exposure can cause damages to the nervous system, and damages to lungs.\nNo economical, operational or environmental consequences.",
        "Emergency response": "There were a lot of problems with the emergency response. Inadequate&nbsp;operational management of the emergency&nbsp;organisation,&nbsp;insufficient training in the use of emergency equipment,&nbsp;insufficient&nbsp;planning on how to rescue people from&nbsp;tall structures, non functioning radio communication.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nActivities, rescources, process and competency must be managed in a way that secures safe working conditions.&nbsp;\nSufficient manning and competency of&nbsp;all shifts&nbsp;is necessary in order&nbsp;to ensure safe operation.\nImportant information must always be logged in the shift protocol and mentioned in the shift hand over. Had this been done, the operators would not have climbed to the top of the reactor without bringing the necessary protective equipment.&nbsp;\nIn&nbsp;the handling of the emergency situation it is important that:\n\nthe organisation and responsibilities are clearly defined\nnecessary training in the use of emergency equipment is performed\nnecessary planning on how to rescue personell from&nbsp;tall structures is performed and described\nwell functioning radio communication\n\n\n"

        "Causes of the accident": "High temperature sulphur corrosion caused by negligent maintenance in combination with strong internal pollution in the convection tube. The seriousness of the situation was not recognised when the first signs of the incident were visible. The procedure prescribed that the operators had to shut down the furnace in case of detection of fire inside the furnace. To do this in a controlled manner,\u00a0 they had to close valves underneath the furnace. This means that there were no efficient measures taken to protect the personnel present. Automatic shut-down was possible, but not in an controlled manner. Maintenance management was inadequate. Replacement of pressurised parts was not documented. As a result of this the age of specific parts was not known. The return bends of the convection tube involved had been replaced in 1997, but not the straight pipe (37 years old) itself.",
        "Consequences": "One operator was at work in the section. After detecting fire around 14.50 in the furnace, evacuation of the area was started. A second operator arrived at the scene, presumably for the change of shift. At 14.55 a large fire started. Both operators were seriously injured. The next morning one of them died in hospital, his colleague is still in hospital with severe injuries.People - Remarks:At one point after detecting the tube leakage a total of 8 persons gathered around the installation to discuss the measures to be taken.

        "Causes of the accident": "During the start up of the weekly NPK fertilizer production, as consequences of a shut-down caused by a failure of the sulphuric acid addition system, overheating and decomposition of urea occurred.The release occurred as consequence of the decomposition of the products used in the production process of NPK fertilizers.The deviation from the normal operative conditions, a higher temperature than needed and possibly a lower dosage of sulphuric acid, contributed to the urea decomposition reaction forming ammonia.The failure in a piston meter joint of the sulphuric acid dosage system, during the start-up of NPK fertilizer production, with a content of 20% nitrogen, obliged to shut-down the process in order to change the joint.After an hour the process was restarted and a light ammonia smell was perceived.Due to the fact that the risk analysis did not foresee such event, no preventive measures were taken, nor were the implications immediately understood.The measures to prevent the emissions of ammonia were taken only after that the ammonia odour was detected in the granular NPK mass.",
        "Consequences": "Very light wind in direction of the city centre and a possible thermal inversion.Effects of ammonia began to be felt outside the plant within an important area of Salamanca.&nbsp; Within an hour more then 600 calls are made to the emergency number 112 and 9 citizens attended at the urgency services of different hospitals.The affected area corresponds to the centre of the city of Salamanca. It has to be considered that the day of the accident was a day of local celebrations, this added to the fact that Salamanca is a tourist city, made that there was a significant number of persons in the streets.With respect to ammonia concentrations in the air it can be assumed that in the affected area concentrations reached odour perception thresholdsConcerning damage and nuisances to persons it could be assumed that in some specific points considering irritation symptoms of the city concentration may have reached values of approx 100 ppm.At urgencies centres a total of 19 persons required medical attention presenting irritation symptoms of respiratory mucous membranes and eye irritation. In one specific case a asthmatic patient presented a more serious symptoms as asthma, syncope, nausea and vomit.",

        "Accident Title": "Fire of naphta in the\u00a0isomerisation plant of a refinery released from a corroded pipe under repair",
        "Start Date": "2007-10-31 11:25:00",
        "Finish Date": "2007-11-01 13:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "At about 11.25am on 31st October 2007 a fire occurred on the C5/C6 Isomerisation plant (Unit 35) at the Petroplus Coryton Refinery.&nbsp; Approximately 48 tonnes of naphtha was released from an insulated pipe feeding the Dehexaniser fractionating column of Unit 35 and subsequently found a source of ignition.&nbsp; The pipe fed into the Dehexaniser column approximately 25 metres above ground.&nbsp; Subsequent examination of the failed pipe revealed that significant corrosion underneath the insulation had occurred on the underside of an elbow of the pipe, just before its entry into the Dehexaniser column.&nbsp; At the time of the incident Unit 35 had been taken temporarily off-line and its feed by-passed while planned repair work to the control system of the Unit\u2019s Emergency Shutdown System (ESD) was carried out. Whilst attempting to rectify a fault on the logic system, the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) failed totally on two occasions.&nbsp; The system was re-set after each failure. However, in between the two failures the flow control valve, FC201, situated between the failed pipe and the Dehexaniser column, and which controls the flow of the Naphtha feed into the column, was manually re-set to 15% open, the normal initial setting for starting up the column.&nbsp; This reduction in the valve opening created a greater resistance to sudden product flow and hence a higher pressure pulse in the feed line (although still within the design capability of the pipework) when the second start up occurred.&nbsp; It is likely that this increase in pressure found a weakness in the feed line as a result of the corrosion, causing it to rupture and release the naphtha product.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The incident was primarily caused by a structural failure of a 200mm NB Carbon Steel feed pipe to the Dehexaniser column on Unit 35.&nbsp; The pipe was insulated and the external surface of the pipe wall beneath the insulation had corroded at a region where water had been collecting.&nbsp; The corrosion had reduced the pipe wall metal thickness to a level that could not support the internal pressure of the process fluids and a major process release occurred.&nbsp; The escaping extremely flammable liquid found an ignition source resulting in a fire which caused extensive damage to Unit 35. \n&nbsp;\nUnit 35 was originally constructed in 1993 to relatively good standards of the time but nevertheless went into operation with a sub standard pipe installation.&nbsp; A walkway support bracket angle iron clashed with the pipe insulation weather cladding, which led to the water ingress at that location.&nbsp; The operating temperature of the pipe and wall wetting created conditions favourable to an accelerated corrosion mechanism.&nbsp; The corrosion progressed over time but remained unrecognised by the refinery ongoing integrity management systems until the failure occurred.&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\nIn 2001, when the refinery was under different ownership, a company wide report had been produced in relation to Corrosion under Insulation (CUI).&nbsp; This recognised that CUI was endemic throughout the company\u2019s operations and a major threat.&nbsp; The refinery developed improved procedures for addressing the report recommendations but had not successfully implemented them up to the time of this incident.&nbsp; ",
        "Consequences": "The outcome of the operator\u2019s failure to recognise Corrosion under Insulation (CUI) at the incident location, and failure to adequately inspect and maintain the plant with respect to CUI, was a large release of an extremely flammable liquid that ignited causing&nbsp;a fire that burned for approximately 3 hours. \n&nbsp;\nNo physical injuries to any Petroplus employees or contractors were reported as a result of the incident.&nbsp; Accident reports were subsequently received from a contractor company operating at site regarding post incident shock experienced by five of their employees.\n&nbsp;\nThe incident caused sufficient damage to close the refinery for approximately 8 weeks.&nbsp; Information given on the Petroplus website estimated that the costs of the repairs to the plant would be of the order of $15 million\n&nbsp;\nFirewater run-off was generally well managed and was contained on-site with little or no impact on the effluent treatment system. ",
        "Emergency response": "More than 20 on-site refinery fire crew attended the incident. Off-site emergency services also attended but were not physically involved in fire fighting.\n&nbsp;\nThe emergency response to the incident highlighted issues regarding compliance with the evacuation procedures by both employees and contractors.&nbsp; Although all personnel were evacuated from site, the evacuation procedure, as written in the Coryton Incident Management plan, requires that on hearing the site major incident alarm, personnel should go to their local designated building, and to the assembly point therein.&nbsp; After the alarm sounded on the day of the incident approximately 220 contractors ignored this and logged out of site leaving via the main security gate.&nbsp; A small number of Petroplus employees also left site in this way. When a Petroplus employee was despatched to effect a head count, the contractors were subsequently found to have assembled in the contractor village on the West site. During their induction to site contractors are told that in the event of a major incident alarm they should go to their nearest designated building, and are provided with a book showing the locations of the designated buildings.\n&nbsp;\nThe audibility of alarms at certain locations was poor which meant that it took some time before all personnel were informed of the hazard present on the plant.\n&nbsp;\nThere was no record made, prior to the response, of the members of the site emergency crew.&nbsp; This would normally be done using a tag board located on the fire appliance in use.&nbsp; However, at the time of the incident the usual fire appliance that carries a tag board was out of service and the replacement appliance used did not carry a tag board.",
        "Lesson Learned": "As part of the reinstatement process and continued operations at the refinery, the Competent Authority required the operator to demonstrate that&nbsp;\"on-refinery on-plot pipework had been assessed for the potential of corrosion under insulation (CUI)\"; and&nbsp;\"that steps taken to ensure that the occurrence of CUI affecting integrity of refinery on-plot pipework be reliably identified and that any necessary repairs undertaken\".&nbsp;\n\nAll on plot pipework meeting the conditions for most likelihood of failure from CUI (insulated and operating between minus 10oc and plus 150oc) and also with the most consequence of failure (Class 1 and 2 pipes, as per API 570) was targeted for inspection.&nbsp; This pipework was identified from the Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and two teams each consisting of a Mechanical Engineer, Production Operator, and an Inspection Engineer walked the lines looking for areas of concern e.g. water ingress points, damaged cladding, cladding obstructions, and visual symptoms such as rust staining or bulging of the cladding.&nbsp; This approach identified approximately 250 locations for insulation removal which was completed, together with pipework inspections and any resulting remedial work, before the unit was reinstated.&nbsp; Four incidents of CUI were identified, where the wall loss in the localised area had exceeded the corrosion allowance of the line.&nbsp; Repairs are scheduled to either replace or install temporary repair clamps.\n&nbsp;\nPetroplus finalised a formal inspection and management regime for CUI: \u2018Equipment Maintenance Strategy EMS-MECH 36: Insulated Piping \u2013 Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) Management\u2019 and developed an action plan for its implementation across the refinery. \n&nbsp;\nImprovements are required on the evacuation procedures, roll-call arrangements and audibility of alarms. Inconsistencies between the Incident Management Plan and the Emergency Response Procedure need to be resolved. \nPetroplus have&nbsp;reviewed&nbsp;their procedures and&nbsp;actions&nbsp;will be monitored.&nbsp;"

        "Emergency response": "The plant was immediately shut-down and the on-site emergency plan was released in the following minutes",
        "Lesson Learned": "The processing procedures were revised for all units of the plant using nitric acid.&nbsp;Additional safety measures were taken:- operators can no longer activate manually the valves of reagents- a temperature safety device is installed on the reactor. When the reactor is not purged with nitrogen, the feeding valves are closed as soon as the temperature reaches 25\u00b0C,- safety test and alarm systems are set in place,- safety systems linked with the feeding of reagents in the reactor have been doubled The redundancy is assured by the level control, which adds to the existing flow rate control and duration control.- the transfer flow rate is physically limited in order to avoid pump stops caused by inerting gas pressure loss."

        "Causes of the accident": "The direct cause was corrosion under insulation in a 4\u201d pipe between av naphta pump and a cooler. The indirect cause was that this pipe had fallen out of the inspection system SAP in 2008, and therefore had not been inspected since.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "Regarding the operation of the plant the consequences were small because they were able to operate the plant without this pipeline. There were no environmental consequences beacuse the leakage was collected in a closed open drainage system. The plant started normal operation again shortly after the disconnection of the corroded part of the system. The naphta was close to the boiling point when it was released, and therefore the operators may have been exposed to benzen. This is not yet clarified.Potentially the leakage could have been ignited by the furnaces and started a fire in the pipestill area. Due to the lack of fire- and gas detection systems in this part of the plant, a fire could have escalated. A fire also could have resulted in an increase of the leakage rate from the corroded pipe, causing even further escalation.&nbsp;",
        "Emergency response": "After the leakage was identified by the operator the following actions were taken: Alarming of the control room, check of leakage point, activation of the gas alarm and of the emergency preparedness organisasion (15 minutes after the leakage was identified), evacuation of non-essential personnel, foaming of the leakage point and surrounding areas, activation of technical support, activation of permanent and mobile fire extinguishing equipment, installation of water curtains in order to prevent gas reaching hot surfaces like furnaces, installation of mobile hydrocarbon detectors between the point of leakage and the potential ignition source. From activation of the alarm, it took 40 minutes before all non-essential personnel was accounted for. This happened because the normal registration system for evacuated personnel was located in a room that was closed due to the ongoing covid-19 situation. Foaming and other activities were continued until the leakage was stopped and the situation was under control.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Plant/Equipment: Corrosion of piping under insulation due to lack of inspection\nOrganisational/ system related:&nbsp;\n- The system did not assertain that that all essential equipment/ piping was included in the inspection and maintenance programme.\n- The risk assessment did not evaluate the need for fire- and gas detection in the pipestill area. Had there not been personnel present, the leakage might not be identified in time to prevent an ignition.\nHuman: The safety of involved operations- and maintenance personnel was nut sufficient during this situation. In the early phase of the situation 3 operators were close to the point of leakage in order to identify the leakage point. They did not carry with them the neccessary HC-gasdetector nor protection against benzen-exposure. This was not according to internal procedures.&nbsp;"

        "Finish Date": "2020-12-02 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "\n\nA fire occured in the compressor house of the methanol plant. In this compressor house, in addition to containing equipment for compressing the synthesis gas (H2, CO2 and CO), there was also located a steam powered turbine generator with belonging equipment. When the fire started, the methanol plant was shut down. The attempted emergency stop of the steam powered turbine generator resulted in a total breakdown of the generator. Several components loosened from the turbine, were flung out with great force, and hit pipelines for the lube oil system inside the compressor house. This caused a lube oil leak, which ignited.The fire did not spread to the other systems in the compressor house. The incident had a major accident potential and could have caused serious personal injury or death as well as substantial economic loss.\n\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "Direct cause: The direct cause of the turbine breakdown with subsequent fire was that isolation from the steam network at the intermediate pressure level failed to function as intended during emergency shut down of the system. This happened because a back flow valve did not function as intended. The back flow of steam increased the rotation in the turbine, which again caused that components loosened from the turbine and were flung out with great force.\nUnderlying causes are: The criticality of the valve was from the start of the plant wrongfully classified as low. This mistake had not been identified in later system reviews of the maintenance system. Due to this, only temporary repairs had been made on the valve that should prevent back flow of steam from the steam pipelines to the steam turbine, even though they had experienced problems with the valve for a long time. Nine corrective jobs had been performed on this valve during the last year, the latest work order on the valve's actuator had not been performed according to the deadline, and because the valve was not identified as safety critical this delay was not evaluated.&nbsp;",
        "Consequences": "Consequences: The actual consequences of the turbine breakdown were that turbine components came loose and caused damage to equipment and the building. Objects struck by components included piping for the turbine&rsquo;s lube oil system. The leaking lube oil ignited and caused a fire which lasted about an hour, but the fire did not spread to other systems in the compressor house. About 1 000 litres of lube oil are estimated to have leaked out. No physical injuries were sustained as a result of the incident.\nBecause of the incident, production from the methanol plant was down for about 12 weeks. The plant came back on line in week 7 without the damaged turbine.\nPotential consequences: In the event of a turbine trip, plant operators are supposed to make a physical check of the turbine generator. Had an operator or other personnel been in the compressor house when the breakdown occurred, they could have been struck by flying components. The latter have also been hurled with great force through the walls of the compressor house and could have hit people outside the building.\nFlying components have also hit the synthesis gas plant located in the same building. Had this caused a synthesis gas leak, the outcome could have been an explosion and/or a large fire. On that basis, the company's assessment is that the incident had a major accident potential and could have caused serious personal injury or death as well as substantial financial loss.",
        "Emergency response": "Operators in the plant informed the control room about noise and vibrations at the same time as automatic fire detectors and fire alarms were activated. ESD and Internal Emergency plan were activated, and Municipal fire brigade and other emergency- and rescue services contacted. ESD included disconnection of the energy supply to the control room, activation of deluge and pressure relief. In addition to evacuation alarm, sirenes and loudspeakers informed about the situation and asked personnel to evacuate. Two stationary water cannons located 30 meters from the compressor building were activated manually. Two municipal firebrigades, police and other rescue services took part.\nApproximately 40 persons were evacuated from the plant.",
        "Lesson Learned": "\nInsufficient identification of safety critical equipment and systematic follow up of technical integrity.\nInsufficient barriers for reducing the possibility of dangerous situations.\nDocumentation for mechanical components was not easily available\nMinimum safety distances for emergency personnel was not established\nA performance standard for personnel check (POB) in the plant was not established.&nbsp;\n"

        "Finish Date": "1987-10-21 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "The un-staffed site contained two water-sealed gas holders which received and delivered natural gas via a volume governor. The levels of gas in the holders were monitored in the remote control station by means of pressure indicators. Each holder had an automatic valve which was operated by a high and low-level trip via pilot gas connections containing poppet valves. During the severe gales in the early hours of October 16, one holder descended from a full position above high knock-off level to a position just below the knock-off level. In descending, the holder failed to operate the high knock-off valve correctly (it is assumed that this was due to wind pressure). During late afternoon of October 21 (five days later) the reducing ambient temperature caused the stock in both holders to fall. At approximately 20:00 the holder descended low enough to operate the change over poppet and the automatic holder valve opened. The ascending holder should have operated the change over poppet again and in the situation which prevailed the holder valve should have closed, but this failed to occur. It is assumed that this poppet valve dwelled in a mid point position. This allowed gas to pass from one holder into the other. The knock-off arm being in the incorrect position was damaged by the striker arm on its upward travel. Gas continued to pass into the holder when it was full and began to discharge via the ground level water seal. The high alarm was registered at the regional control room and an emergency team was sent to the site. Gas continued to leak for about one hour but it was not ignited. Gas leaked from one side of the seal which was about 4 metres from the boundary fence, about 5 metres from gardens of private houses and about 15 metres from the houses themselves.",
        "Causes of the accident": "CAUSES:\nThe accident occurred because of the failure of two poppet valves that allowed the overfilling of a gas holder. One poppet valve failed to operate correctly due to the severe wind conditions. The second poppet valve failed to operate failed to operate correctly due to an abnormal friction within its bearing surfaces causing it to dwell in an intermediate position, allowing gas to discharge from  one holder to the other.\n",
        "Consequences": "OTHER:No material losses occurred except the escaped natural gas.Affected Area: installation",
        "Emergency response": "INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:A pressure indicator activated an alarm in the regional control room. An emergency team was sent to the storage plant.No off-site emergency measure were necessary (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).",
        "Lesson Learned": "The sticky poppet valve has been replaced. The damages to the high/low knock-off spider arm have been repaired.\n\nMeasures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the operations of the gas holders were reviewed to decide whether any further changes were necessary to prevent a similar occurrence."

The tank got a new bottom on Wednesday (05/07/89) and was replaced Wednesday evening. After mechanical completion of the replacement work, the Thursday evening&nbsp; a trial had been undertaken to fill the tank up, but overpressure was registered in the tank and also the flange connecting the feeding line to the tank leaked. Consequently the filling operation was stopped. The problems were reported to the maintenance department, the flange&nbsp; connection was repaired and the pressure relief line checked. The trial to fill the tank was not reported to the shift supervisor. A shift change took place and the supervisor recorded in the production log-book that the tank was empty. The next day (Friday 07/07/89) a safe work permit was issued by the supervisor of the next shift to the mechanics to disconnect the piping associated with this tank for further repair. The repair work proceeded and during the grinding of a disconnected pipe, a mechanic noticed a whistling sound and hid, together with the 3 others mechanics, behind a concrete tank farm wall. Soon afterwards, the tank exploded. The top of the tank was blown over an adjacent manufacturing building, landing at the grass-strip between the adjacent building and the office-buildings and struck into another office building (approximately 60 metres away) which was empty.

As a result of the uncontrolled reaction, the IBC was destroyed and approximately 200 l of acetic anhydride evaporated or formed a fine spray. A member of staff who happened to be in the affected area of the plant was seriously injured (eye and leg burns. First aid was administered. The district coordination centre was immediately informed and medical first aid was organised. The member of staff was taken to hospital). At the plant, the feed tubes to the distillation condenser were destroyed, as were the fluid pipes (nitrogen, control air, exhaust air) located near the feed point.\nIn the adjacent stairwell, a temporary window was broken.\nDue to the disruption to liquid and gas supplies, production in the affected part of the plant and the rest of the plant had to be stopped. Continued operation at the plant was prohibited by the competent monitoring authority. Immediately after the incident occurred, first aid was administered to the injured member of staff and the district coordination centre was informed in accordance with the Operating Alarm and Security Plan (Betrieblicher Alarm- und Gefahrenabwehrplan, BAGAP). An associated member of staff was able to find a way to condense the leaked acetic acid + acetic anhydride vapour after donning the necessary personal protective equipment.\n",
        "Causes of the accident": "The operational fault was not caused directly by the synthesis process but by shortcomings in the safe management of waste disposal. The following course of events was deduced based on current information:\n- A replacement IBC was provided containing a sufficiently large quantity of contaminants (probably aniline compounds and water) the presence of which was not noticed when a basic visual inspection was carried out owing to its high viscosity or relatively firm \u2018skin\u2019 and its colour which resembled that of the IBC.\n- The viscosity, poor miscibility with the distillate and/or firm surface of the contaminant prevented the distillate from mixing quickly when drained.\n- The resulting heat of the reaction in the IBC enabled diffusion to take place in the reaction system.\n- Once the activation energy/start temperature was exceeded, a compound in the reaction mixture catalysed the chemical reaction between the contaminants and acetic anhydride.\n- The heat could not be sufficiently dissipated, leading to a runaway reaction which caused sudden vaporisation of the contents of the IBC (thermal explosion).\n- The pressure and temperature in the IBC increased very quickly. The IBC was destroyed due to pressure and thermal overload.\n",
        "Consequences": "A member of staff who happened to be in the affected area of the plant was seriously injured (eye and leg burns. First aid was administered. The district coordination centre was immediately informed and medical first aid was organised. The member of staff was taken to hospital).

The reactor was put out of service and a slow pressurization with process gases (hydrogen and nitrogen) was carried out at ambient temperature. It was necessary to carry out many pneumatical cycles of pressurization and depressurization because of leaks from some flanges. After any cycle, the bolts of the flanges were tightened and a purging with nitrogen at 8 ate was carried out. Finally, a slow pressurization (20 minutes before the explosion occurred the internal pressure was about 250 kg/cm2 at a temperature of about 20-30\u00b0C) with process gases was in progress at ambient temperature when, suddenly, an explosion occurred. 3 people were operating inside the plant when the explosion occurred: 1 of them was killed and a second one was in a state of shock. The explosion destroyed the upper part of the column and metallic parts of the reactor were thrown in a radius of many metres around it. It also caused the complete destruction of the building where the reactor was located. After the accident, on-site arrived the local fire brigade and the police.

By having in the sebum, the oxygenated water added decomposed giving oxygen gas. The presence of oxygen generated at 73-74 \u00b0 C (which was the temperature of the reactor at the time of the accident) caused the self-ignition of the isopropanol vapors.

        "Finish Date": "2000-03-29 00:00:00",
        "Accident Description": "On a chemical  platform, a release of hydrocyanic acid occurred in a unit for the synthesis of hydrocyanic acid, belonging to the unit for the production of adiponitrile.\n\nThe release is small but the lessons learned with regard to the organisational aspects of the installation are interesting. The accident is therefore notified only for this reason, since the criteria of Annex VI are not fulfilled.\n\nThe accident is classified at level 0 of the gravity scale, based on the available information.The accident:The accident occurred on the HCN production installations, at the level of a mist separator placed on the residual gas transfer line between the head of the HCN absorption tower and the CNIM boiler.Several incidents had occurred during the previous days:- Problems in extracting liquids at the base of the HCN purification tower (tower H2243) from March 20 to 26 made it necessary to use a second pump. On March 27th, the decision was taken to shutdown the distillation train to clean the HCN polymers that had formed.The shut-down procedure foresaw:&nbsp;- draining the HCN from the train, up to 2% HCN in the drainage water, by directing it toward the ADN unit,- performing air stripping until an HCN concentration is reached which allows the equipment to be opened, the residual gases being burned in the CNIM boiler.On March 28 and 29, the distillation train was drained (shut-down of the HCN converters, as well as the natural gas heaters and the upstream TGN). Draining remained difficult due to extraction problems at the base of tower H2243. On March 29th at 13:00, the decision was taken to switch over to the air stripping phase.The concentration of 1.2% HCN in the towers, measured at the base of tower H2242, was higher than the usual values although it was below the threshold value of 5% tolerated during the operating mode.In compliance with the safety procedures, the workshop was evacuated on March 29th at 16:15 p.m. before the stripping operation was launched. The order to evacuate was cancelled 15 minutes later and 9 people returned to the workshop.The explosion occurred at 16:40 at the level of the mist separator H1191 located at 5 m height on the gas line.The two nearest analysers (Toxguard) located at a distance of 10 and 15 m indicated 30 ppm of HCN; the concentration values dropped after 5 minutes. Other equipment located 100 m from the unit sporadically detected values in the order of 4 to 5 ppm of HCN.The shop personnel were evacuated to a withdrawal zone and the stripping operation was shut down immediately. At 16:45 the unit's Toxguard detector detected a HCN concentration higher than 5 ppm and triggered alarm, the 300 people present in the establishment were ordered to shelter. The on-site emergency plan was put into operation at the same time and the on-site fire-brigade intervened with SCBA (self contained breathing apparatus). Water curtains were set up around the installations.HCN concentrations measured outside the workshop were below 2ppm.The header line of the HCN absorption tower was isolated from tower H2241 at 17:30. Only the Toxguard near the separator unit still indicated a concentration of 15 ppm of HCN 30 min later. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "The analysis of the accident was conducted by an interdisciplinary work group. Its potential causes were examined&nbsp; using the failure tree method. A safe-T-tree was then constructed after having eliminated the highly improbable potential causes: a flashback produced from the boiler was stopped by the separator tank (H1191).According to the operator, the accident was caused by:&nbsp;- the presence of polymers in the tower which slowed down the drainage of HCN,&nbsp; - at the start of the air stripping phase, an operation conducted with an HCN content higher than normal in the residual gases, the normal drainage of the trains not having been conducted,&nbsp; - the presence of several inconsistencies in the implementation procedure:&nbsp;- since 1989, the stripping procedure has consisted of a blocking phase based on a safety threshold level set at 5% HCN in liquid phase. This threshold is erroneous, stripping at 10\u00b0C with an HCN concentration &gt; 1.2% in the liquid leading the lower explosive limit (LEL = 6%) of the hydrocyanic acid in gas phase to be reached. At the time of the accident, the HCN concentration of the liquid at the base of tower H2242 was 1.2%, compatible with the threshold.&nbsp;- the sample of liquid analysed at the base of tower H2242, containing 1.2% HCN, was not representative of the real HCN amount of the train.A posteriori, the average concentration of the amount analysed was 2%.&nbsp;- the gas phase HCN analyser present at the tower head was not adapted and did not allow the operators to be alerted. The device was limited to \"normal\" operating ranges: alarm at 0.9% and no measurement beyond 1.2%.&nbsp;- the operating mode did not explicitly indicate the action to be taken for a concentrationgreater than 0.9%.By reducing the air outputs, the operators:- reduced the speed of the gases in the line toward the boiler,- promoted flashback,- increased the HCN content in the air and the risk of exceeding the L.E.L.",
        "Consequences": "The operator evaluated the quantity of HCN released into the atmosphere at 25 kg and the property damage was limited: the line to the boiler was expanded over 1m in length and a the collar of the separator tank was ripped over 400 cm\u00b2.No consequences were observed on the personnel and the plant's environment.",
        "Emergency response": "Since at 19:00 no consequences for the personnel or the environment had been reported, the operator decides not to activate the off-site (external) emergency plan, and the internal contingency&nbsp; plan is terminated, while the order for the employees' confinement is withdrawn.The inspectorate for classified installations (DRIRE) and the mayors of the 3 neighbouring Municipalities were informed, but the prefecture was not&nbsp; informed by the operator.",
        "Lesson Learned": "On April 5th, the classified installations inspectorate (DRIRE) requested that the operator submit an accident report, as well as the measures taken or to be taken and to check if this type of accident had been contemplated within the scope of the project of extension.On April 10th, the operator presented the inspectorate with the conclusions of his post-accident analysis and the measures taken or which would be implemented in the near future in order to prevent recurrence of such an accident. It took note of these measures and no objection was made concerning putting the installations back into service.The cleaning of the installations, the repair of the separator unit and the damaged piping, followed by the progressive restarting of the HCN shop, then the TGN, took place from Monday 10th through Thursday 13th April, 2000.Corrective actions at first proposed by the operator:&nbsp;* Immediate modification of the shutdown procedure,&nbsp;* Immediate replacement of air by nitrogen during stripping,&nbsp;* Installation of an analyser in the column's gas exhaust which is independent of the analyser used for the process, and which triggers the emergency shut-down of the stripping process if HCN concentrations &gt; 0.9% are detected,&nbsp;* Installation of a flame protection system between the mist separator and the boiler, in order to avoid any flashbacks.After several further requests, the following additional elements were adopted:&nbsp;* The internal emergency plan is modified: The prefecture, the Regional Directorate For Industry, Research and Environment (DRIRE -- Direction REgionale de l'Industrie, de la Recherche et de l'Environnement), and the police will be informed about any gas alarm (even if triggered at very low concentrations) if it lasts longer than 30 min.;&nbsp;* A flame protection system will be installed upstream of the boiler with the next major shutdown of the installations;&nbsp;* The operating mode is modified for the phases following the exhaustion of the HCN reaction chain &nbsp;- in order to reduce the HCN concentration below the LEL concentrations, stripping is begun with nitrogen in the liquid as well as in the gas phase&nbsp;- Change over to air stripping for concentrations below 0.7%;&nbsp;- Lowering of the alarm threshold and installation of a safety system acting on the backflow rate (recirculated rate of flow) of the liquid phase;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Stripping will be continued until a HCN concentration of 1 ppm in the liquid phase is reached.&nbsp;* Moreover, the operator proposes improving the sprinkling with acidic solution inside the column in order to avoid the risk of polymerisation caused by low acidity.&nbsp;* Analysis of two possible worsening scenarios for the accident of 29 March 2000:&nbsp;- shut-off failure of the tank valves: the release would have continued with 1 t/h of N2 with 2,6% of HCN, i.e. with 26 kg/h of HCN and a lethal limit zone (ZOLEM zone limite effets mortels) below 50 m;&nbsp;- Propagation of the explosion beyond the .droplet separation vessel up to the .absorption column head and bursting of the latter. Release from the .column head of 30 t/h of air with 5.6% HCN, at a height of 30 m, and the formation of a pool on the ground with a maximum concentration of 5.6% HCN &nbsp;# First release of 0.5 kg/s HCN : a limit zone between reversible/irreversible effects of 230 m.&nbsp;# Evaporation of the pool: limit zone between reversible/irreversible effects of the first scenario-&nbsp; limit zone between reversible/irreversible effects of the worst case scenario considered for the modification project for the installation.&nbsp;The effects of such an accident would not go beyond the boundaries of the site.&nbsp;* Launching of an inspection program for procedures and instrumentation during start-up and shut-down phases: 38 situation data sheets have been prepared."

        "Accident Description": "At a petrochemical site, gaseous hydrocarbons leaked from a 3-inch pipe under pressure of 300 mbar.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The incident occurred during a prolonged cold spell, when the temperature had remained below freezing for 8 days and had fallen as low as -18 \u00b0C. The equipment was designed for a minimum temperature of -12 \u00b0C. The damaged section developed a crack of 5-6 cm caused by the pipe freezing and began to leak with the thaw. The accumulation of water in the piping resulted from the presence of wet gas and the fact that no product flowed through the unused branch. An inspection 8 years previously had not detected any significant loss of metal thickness in this section, which was classified at a low criticality level.\nThe leak took a long time to locate because the gas is colourless and because of the site and height of the section, the non-activation of the gas detectors in the unit and insufficient information from the operative in the control room. The operative manages stocks of diluent per item of equipment and per hour, but does not have any summary view of the overall daily consumption of diluent across the entire unit. This figure can only be obtained by means of a detailed analysis, which pinpoints the start of the leak to more than 3 days before the accident. The day before, abnormal consumption of diluent had been detected on the display screen, but the low pressure in the section, the height of the piping and the colourless nature of the product meant that the leak could not be located precisely. An operative found it by chance the following day when climbing scaffolding erected for planned maintenance.",
        "Consequences": "This discharge of 8.5 t of CH3Cl over 80 hours &ndash; compared with 150 t discharged annually &ndash; did not have any impact in terms of acute or chronic toxicity for the neighbourhood.",
        "Emergency response": "Operatives wearing self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) temporarily stopped the leak using an active leak sealing system (polymer strip type), and a monitoring procedure was put in place.",
        "Lesson Learned": "The damaged piping was removed a few weeks later and the operator took a number of measures to remove or monitor the presence of water in pipes with the same characteristics and carrying toxic or flammable fluids in times of extreme cold: sections concerned put out of service, removal of water from the pipes or enhanced vigilance in the event of meteorological hazards."

The short circuit on a pair of electrodes meant that the entire current was directed over one single pair of electrodes, causing considerable heating above fluid level. No substances listed in appendix 1 of the Seveso Directive were involved in the fire itself. The fluid which leaked out of the recycling cell was channelled along the floor drainage system of the in-plant waste water treatment system. ",
        "Causes of the accident": "The fire was caused by a short circuit between cathode and anode in the electrolytic cell for copper recovery and cyanide removal from the wash water of a galvanisation plant. The short circuit was caused by an unusual, one-sided growth of the copper layer from the cathode.",
        "Consequences": "Material damage inside the plant: fire damage to production hall&nbsp; ",
        "Emergency response": "Safety function:Building monitoring system signalled malfunction (compressor) to caretaker, alarm released according emergency response plan, power switched off in production halls, external action forces instructed by way of emergency response plans.Safety measures:- Offsite - Road closed during event - Power switched off in production halls- On-site coordination by technical manager and emergency response manager according to the onsite emergency response plan;Damage repaired:- Soot removed from equipment and parts of building on first floor- Fire proof cover on ground floor replaced- Electrical installation replaced- Damaged system dismantled- Complete renovation of ground floor; Safety measures by offsite emergency response services:Fire extinguished itself, there was no increase in the concentration of toxic substances measured by the fire brigade in the building directly after the event.Evacuation measures by offsite emergency response services: evacuation of production area on first floor of buildings 6 and 8.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence:- installation of voltage monitors which switch off the rectifier (power source) when voltage changes. The copper contained in the rinsing water is cathodically separated by direct current in the recycling cell, whilst the cyanide ions are removed from the anodes. &nbsp;Direct current is generated by a rectifier. If there is a short circuit between anode and cathode in the recycling cell, the voltage drops (towards 0 V) and the current level reaches the rectifier's capacity. As in the case of a short circuit almost the entire current flows solely via the jumper, the connectors heat up considerably which can cause plastic parts in close proximity to ignite. The voltage monitor activates a relay contact if the voltage changes. This relay contact is used to switch off the rectifier and thus prevent the components from heating up."

        "Accident Description": "In the sulphur dichloride (SCl2) distillation facility in a chemical plant, a spillage of SCl2 occurred at around 13.10 in the retention area for a distillation column in the final stages of distillation, after a leak from a recirculating pump. The SCl2 hydrolysed upon contact with ambient humidity, causing an intensive emission of hydrogen chloride (HCl), which was not detected by the column's HCl gas detector (the threshold was at 25 ppm). A safety alarm installed in the facility went off at 13.12 (giving a reading of 105 ppm of HCl). The automated system shut down the facility and set off a local audible and visual alarm, while alarm warnings were appearing on the screens in the control room. The internal emergency plan was activated at 13.35, and the 35 employees were evacuated. The internal fire team, supported by 40 external fire fighters, equipped themselves with breathing apparatus and plugged the leak; the cloud of HCl was overcome using 4 lateral fire hose lines. The 120 m\u00b3 of water used was collected in a retention basin to be re-used in production. The internal emergency plan was lifted at 16.15. The next day, a specialised company pumped the 800 l (1200 kg) of spilled sulphur dichloride into the retention tank and then transferred to a storage vat. The HCl remained confined in the building. The retention basins were cleaned using a neutralising mixture (water + potassium carbonate), which was then pumped to the factory's treatment plant, where it was treated. A comparable accident took place at the site in 2006 (ARIA 31691).\nThe leak was caused by a mechanical rupture in the recirculating pump of a storage tank which had been filled 50 minutes earlier. This was aggravated by the non-closure of an automatic valve at the base of the tank, despite the fact that it had been activated, firstly by the safety controller when it was shut off, and then by the shut-off at the base of the tank at 13.30. A mechanical problem was the origin of the non-closure of the valve at the base of the tank; there had been difficulties closing this for the past 10 days. The authority for the inspection of classified installations notes that the pump's performance did not appear to be suited to its requirements, considering the large number of maintenance operations that it underwent prior to the accident. For his part, the operator countered that the pump's technology had functioned for more than 10 years without any signs of failure. In addition to having the pump and the valve assessed, the operator put the following measures in place:\n- The faulty pump and the valve at the base of the tank were replaced, as was the latter's actuator;\n- As a preventive measure, the weight indicators (weight sensors) of the damaged tank and that of the adjacent tank were replaced;\n- The cell of the HCl gas detector for the column was replaced and calibrated, as the malfunctioning of the existing detector, which had been checked 5 and a half months prior to the accident (the manufacturer recommends that this be done every 3 to 4 months) had not been remedied by re-calibration;\n- The valve at the base of each of the four SCl2 storage tanks was linked to the local HCl detection system;\n- Manual valves used to isolate the recirculating pump were automated and linked to the emergency shut-off system;\n- A drip tray was installed on the pump's leakage controller in order to prevent splashing from the retention tank.\n",

        "Consequences": "From ARIA 31691\nEnvironmental consequences\nNo direct environmental consequences were recorded. The atmospheric hydrogen chloride measurements taken outside the site did not indicate any accidental pollution; only 50 ppm was recorded in the distillation column. The 150 m3 of water used by the water curtains deployed to neutralise the acid cloud was recovered (pH = 7), distilled and recycled in the process. Human consequences\nThe three employees who had entered the building during the operation had suffered from irritations and were thus hospitalised less than 24 hours. Activity and economic consequences\nThe activity downstream from the sulphur dichloride distillation operation, namely the synthesis of TB\nM6, was shut down for 18 days.

        "Lesson Learned": "From ARIA 31691\nThe accident, which occurred in an installation that had not been examined during the danger study, brought the following points to light: -the importance of detecting, controlling and assessing the consequences of changes in the nature of stabilisers and other additives added to dangerous raw materials (sulphur dichloride) by suppliers. These modifications may be a source of triggering events (crystallisation and clogging in this case) and increased risk; -Even if events that seem insignificant in the smoot\nh running of the process such as the presence of glass debris from the lining of the distillation column coupled with the lack of a maintenance program on the production equipment (cleaning of the boiler) or safety equipment (clogging of the pressure sensor) do not directly lead to accidents, can have a considerable impact on the safety in downgraded modes; -a routine, unusual or exceptional maintenance operation (replacement of a pressure sensor) must be subject to a complete prior risk analysis, in order to avoid creating conditions which could lead to an accident or aggravate the initial consequences. In case of dangerous substances, these operations must be monitored and re-evaluated according to the hazards of the intervention; -the relative efficiency and the reliability of the procedures and more generally, organisational barriers (lock-out/lock-out removal); -a control system (steam valve) for a process can in no way be considered a safety system and cannot be retained as such. In particular, the production PLCs follow logic and criteria which the intervention teams are not fully aware of and which do not necessarily take the downgraded modes and lock-out situations into account. -the importance of installation design as early as the design phase (glass/metal interface); -the importance of risk analysis and failure modes, as well as technical and organisational barriers, with maximum details, for the various \"operating\" modes.\n"

        "Accident Description": "On 30/04/06 at 14:40 hrs. a plant operator noticed a spot of liquid hydrocarbons (HC) in the trench, in correspondence of the cross point of roads 8 and L, in proximity of the subway of road ex SS114 (sea side). At 15:00 hrs. The leak was localized on a pipeline section 2 m from the subway; in correspondence to road Nr. 9/0; the pipeline connected tank DA1085 in the crude oil tank-farm SG10 with the refinery's topping plant CR20 (as shown in the map included in the records).The company decided to seal the leak by installing a sealing collar on the located rupture point. The workers dismantled the piping insulation (latten and rock wool) in the corresponding pipe section. After the insulation had been dismantled the spill increased with hot hydrocarbons (60\u00b0 C) spraying downwards towards the subway. The approx. 30 mm long fissure, parallel to the pipe axis presented a 30\u00b0 angle generating line. A liquid hydrocarbon pool formed and spread at least up to the first detection point due to the slope inclination (some 60 m from the leakage point in the pipe).At 16:10 hrs, the competent authorities for off-site emergencies were alerted by FAX, in compliance with the memorandum of understanding signed with the local authorities.Approximately at 17:35 hrs, immediately after conclusion of the insulation dismantling operation, the personnel staying uphill to the subway, saw smoke coming from the opposite side of the subway (sea side) some 60 m from the leakage point. At this stage, approximately 3 hours after the leak detection the onsite emergency response plan was triggered: - mobilisation of the onsite fire brigade,&nbsp;- isolation the pipe lines starting with the leaking one, as precautionary measure,&nbsp;- closure of road ex SS114 passing through the establishment,The onsite fire brigade mobilised initially two emergency response vehicles, spraying foam on the area were the smoke was generated. At 17:42 hrs the shift commander of the onsite fire brigade alerted the public fire department in Siracusa, once he understood that the fire was out of control.Meanwhile the shift manager called the refinery's emergency response committee and alerted the personnel of Syndial and Polimeri Europa, owners of some of the pipe lines in the affected trench.&nbsp;After a few minutes another fire front developed from the entry of the subway in road Nr 9/0 (uphill), also this fire was fought initially by the onsite emergency response services, with other two fire fighting vehicles.At 18:10 hrs The public fire brigade arrived from Siracusa and took the command of the emergency response management.At 18:50 a first BLEVE explosion occurred in another pipeline line containing probably light hydro carbons, and was followed by successive explosions of pipelines in the same trench, all due to the overheating of the products inside the pipeline consequent to the heat irradiation of the fire in the trench.At 18:55 the decision was taken to shut down all installations inside the establishment, as precautionary measureFire extinguishing operations lasted 48 hours, the fire damaged seriously the pipelines uphill and downhill the subway, as well as aerial pipelines passing parallel to the trench or crossing it. Further limited damage occurred to the subway. During the accident 4 members of the onsite fire brigade, 2 plant operators and 8 members of&nbsp; the public Fire brigade were hospitalised for more than 10 days due to burns, contusions and/or intoxication.",
        "Causes of the accident": "&nbsp;The causes of the accident are of technical nature:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concerning the causes of the leak, it has been determined that the pipe was perforated due to corrosion processes which occurred externally on the pipe surface; as stated in the technical consultancy report of TUV Italia S.R.L (Italian branch of the German Product Certification Organization), prepared on request of the Attorney General's Office of Siracusa (reportr Nr. 165145/06 dated 16.09.06) and deposited on 16/11/2006).-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above mentioned report states in the conclusion ns of the report: \"basing on the results obtained it appears evident that the fissure formed in the pipe is the result of a localised corrosion process (rust), affecting the external pipe surface, consuming the pipe wall until perforation.\"The same document states: \"It is likely that the localisation of the fissure, with respect to the point where it formed, is linked to one or more of the following factors:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; localized damage in the original pipe coating-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material defect in the original pipe coating-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; critical operative conditions (of the pipe section in which the fissure occurred) linked to the placement of the pipe near the ground and its exposition to atmospheric events (sea air).The company agrees with this hypothesis on pipe corrosion: The company declares that the pipe was periodically inspected, in compliance with technical norms API 570 \"piping inspection code\", these inspections were formed part of the establishment maintenance program ERG-MED, according to which the last inspection of the pipeline had been performed in February 2005.Concerning this aspect, the technical consultancy report states at page 140 (answer to question Nr. 1 of the Attorney General; that in principle it is not possible to affirm that the maintenance of the pipe in question was insufficient, but it is pointed out that the pipeline examined had been built more than 40 years ago, and was bought from AGIP Petroli Spa in 2002, AGIP did not provide the technical documentation on maintenance operations on the piping bundle prior to the sale. This circumstance has not allowed, according to the technical consultancy report, to verify the compliance with the technical norms on visual tests, inspections and maintenance of the piping system concerned.Concerning the cause of the fire, the company made the supposition that, , the contact between the vapours formed from the spilled hydrocarbons with hot spots of high pressure steam pipes, reaching up to 280\u00b0 steam temperature, in correspondence of the subway, may have contributed to the expansion of a vapour cloud; the vapour cloud ignited on an ignition source downhill from the subway were the first fire was detected.Concerning the successive BLEVEs, which caused major damage to the persons involved in the emergency response operations, these are related directly to the permanent heat irradiation of the fire (which lasted approx. 48 hrs), which overheated other pipelines containing hydrocarbons also in gas form in the pipe string. Concerning the direct involvement of the company, the same company states that the event may have had less serious consequences if the onsite fire brigade would have been alerted immediately at leak detection and not three hours later, as effectively happened.This assumption is confirmed by the technical consultancy report, which affirms that if the onsite fire brigade would have been alerted more rapidly the damages caused by the fire could have been contained.Concerning this aspect it has to be said that the Attorney General's Office is still investigating on the matter.The Human error indicated relates to the faulty application of the Emergency procedures foreseen in the onsite Emergency Plan.The fault during the Repair operation (dismantling of the pipe insulation layer) relates to the failure to adopt appropriate safety measures during the operation.The design fault relates to the inadequate design and rationalisation of the pipe bundle.",
        "Consequences": "Human injuries:10 persons injured hospitalised for more than 24 hours- 8 members of the public fire brigade presenting contusions and burns with a prognosis of more than 10 days hospitalisation- 2 members of the onsite fire brigade presenting contusions and burns (2 days hospitalisation for the tam member with contusions and 30 days hospitalisation for the team member with burns)- 2 plant operators and 2 members of the onsite fire brigade presenting slight injuries caused by contusions and burns and respiratory difficulties were attended by the onsite sanitary service and dismissed promptly.The accident occurred during a week end (Sunday 30 of April) with only the shift personnel of the ERG Nord Refinery of approx. 60 people present onsite, of which 9 formed part of the onsite fire brigade.The number of offsite emergency response personnel (public fire brigade) involved in the response operation, which lasted several days, was of approx. 40 people.The population living in the neighbourhood of the establishment was not affected whereas the personnel of neighbouring establishments (Polimeri Europa, Erg NUCE, Syndial), were potentially exposed to riskSoil and water-shed pollution damage:- Spill of liquid hydrocarbons, extinguishing water on a surface of approx. 800 m2.The company has monitored the water shed on request of the Regional&nbsp; competent Authority by employing the existing piezometers nearest to the area affected, and did not detect any significant variations of the pollution levels with respect to the values determined before the accident.Release of combustion products in the atmosphere :- ARPA - Sicilia (department of Siracusa) has recorded significant increases of Non Methanic Hydrocarbons (NMHC) concentrations in air during the days ranging from 30 of April to 2 of March (maximal concentration of 1917 micrograms/m3 detected on 1 of May 2006 at 9:00 hrs) at the air quality monitoring stations of&nbsp; Scala Greca, Priolo e Melilli with peak values measured at Belvedere; no significant concentration increases of other substances was measured.The wind conditions contributed significantly in dispersing the combustion gas column towards the sea, with precipitation of the particles far from populated areas. The Inter-company Environmental Protection Consortium (Consorzio Interaziendale protezione ambiente - CIPA) has performed an Environmental Impact Analysis of the event and has established that the average concentration levels measured on a three-hourly base, never reached the threshold value of 200 micrograms/m3 (ex DPCM n\u00b0 30 dated 23 March 1983)The accident has not caused an environmental impact. There has been only a leakage of liquid hydrocarbons on a surface of approx. 800 m2. The area has been cleaned by excavating the ground until 30 cm depth.As already mentioned in the short report:The company has monitored the water shed on request of the Regional&nbsp; competent Authority by employing the existing piezometers nearest to the area affected, and did not detect any significant variations of the pollution levels with respect to the values determined before the accident.Emission of combustion products in the atmosphere :- ARPA - Sicilia (department of Siracusa) has recorded significant increases of Not Methanic Hydrocarbons (NMHC) concentrations in air during the days ranging from 30 of April to 2 of March (maximal concentration of 1917 micrograms/m3 detected on 1 of May 2006 at 9:00 hrs) at the air quality monitoring stations of&nbsp; Scala Greca, Priolo e Melilli with peak values measured at Belvedere; no significant concentration increases of other substances were measured for other chemical compounds.The wind conditions contributed significantly in dispersing the combustion gas column towards the sea, with precipitation of the particles far from populated areas. The Inter-company Environmental Protection Consortium (Consorzio Interaziendale protezione ambiente - CIPA) has performed an Environmental Impact Analysis of the event and has established that the average concentration levels of hazardous substances on a three-hourly base never reached the threshold value of 200 micrograms/m3 (ex DPCM n\u00b0 30 dated 23 March 1983)Material damage:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destruction of the pipelines affected by the fire and explosions, damage to a significant part of the pipe bundle located immediately uphill and downhill to the underway, on a approx. 200 m long section. A approx. 330 m long pipe bundle section has been completely substituted. -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage to the pipe racks immediately adjacent to the subway.Loss of production costs for a total of approx. 110.000.000 Euros have to be added the damage calculation.Offsite:Damage to the asphalt coating of road ex SS114 on a approx. 100 m long section.Community Disruption:road ex SS114 was closed during approx 53 days.Rail road Catania-Siracusa was closed during 48 hours.The ship circulation in the port of Augusta) was interrupted by the port authorities of Augusta during approx. 36 hours. All merchant ships present in the port of Augusta (14 ships, 9 docked and 5 FONDA) left the port.The Public schools of Priolo were closed for 1 day.The event had a relevant resonance at national level with a coverage by national&nbsp; television and newspapers.",
        "Emergency response": "The onsite emergency plan has been triggered, initially an extended emergency was declared, and successively an major accident was declared, in compliance with the Onsite Emergency Plan.Chronology of the measures adopted:At 16:10 hrs the authorities competent for emergencies were alerted by FAX, in compliance with the common agreement protocol with the local authorities.Approximately at 17:35 hrs, immediately after the insulation dismantling operation had been concluded, the personnel staying uphill to the subway, saw smoke coming from the opposite side off the subway (sea side) some 60 m from the leakage point. At this stage, approximately 3 hours after the leak detection the onsite emergency response plan was triggered: - mobilisation of the onsite fire brigade,&nbsp;- isolation of the pipe lines starting with the leaking one, as precautionary measure,&nbsp;- closing of road ex SS114 passing through the establishment,The onsite fire brigade intervened initially with two vehicles, spraying foam on the area were the smoke was coming from.

The emergency response operations continued with monitoring and cooling measures of the area affected until the following day, when the prefect declared the end of the emergency.The fire extinguishing operations have been managed in such way to confine the fire in the area corresponding to the subway without extinguishing the fire completely, in order to eliminate completely the presence of hydrocarbons from the hardly accessible trench, where hydrocarbon vapours could have ignited again at any point.Competent Authorities involved (alerted or actively involved in the response)Prefecture of Siracusa, Communal Civil Protection of Priolo and Mellili. Civil Protection of the Sicily Region, Carabinieri, State Police, Attorney General's Office, ARPA Siracusa department.&nbsp;At 18:55 the shut down of all installations inside the establishment was decided as precautionary measure.The Prefect ordered the closure of all gates of the establishment in accordance with the Offsite Emergency Plan, this caused the interruption of all vehicle circulation in the area around the accident place for several days. The circulation on the Siracusa-Catania railway was interrupted during 48 hours, and the ship circulation in the port of Augusta was interrupted during approx. 36 hours.The road exnSS114 was closed during 53 days, waiting for the results of the static structural tests and the substitution of the damaged asphalt covering.The offsite emergency has not caused health consequences to the population living in the neighbouring Communes. The major of Priolo ordered the closure of the public schools for one day&nbsp; and invited the population to stay indoors immediately after the accident as precautionary measure.Emergency measures - Remarks: \"Rebuilding\" refers to the repair of the subway, the substitution of the pavement, the road signs and the guardrails of ex SS114 damaged by the fire on a approx. 100m long road section.\nOfficial action taken - legal action: The Attorney General's Office of Siracusa has opened a criminal proceeding against some of the refinery's managers, with the objective to determine the causes and the responsibilities related to the accident.  With this objective the Attorney General's office has charged a commission of three experts, who officially delivered and deposited on 16/11/2006 a technical consultancy report, copy of which has also been given to the Commission.\nThe criminal proceeding is still under way.\nTUV Italia  S.r.l. has performed a specific study (report  nThe Attorney General's Office of Siracusa has opened a criminal proceeding against some of the refinery's managers, with the objective to determine the causes and the responsibilities related to the accident.&nbsp; With this objective the Attorney General's office has charged a commission of three experts, who officially delivered and deposited on 16/11/2006 a technical consultancy report, copy of which has also been given to the Commission.The criminal proceeding is still under way.TUV Italia&nbsp; S.r.l. has performed a specific study (report&nbsp; n\u00b0 165145/06 of 16.09.06), on request of the Attorney General in the context of the Technical Consultancy Report, aimed to identify the causes which lead to the leak in the pipe.The company has performed a preliminary technical investigation on the event, with the help of external experts and consultants, with the aim to identify the preliminary causes of the accident, and has deposited a technical report at the Attorney General's Office of Siracusa on 19/05/06.The Commission has obtained the information needed to formulate the present Major Accident Report from the two above mentioned reports, from direct discussions with the Company and from other documentation analysed.Official action taken - other official action: \nOn 5 may 2006, immediately after the occurrence, the Technical Regional Committee of Sicily met in the premises of the Fire Department in Siracusa, with the goal to discuss the case, the requests request to realise technical modification measures in the installation and the request to present a detailed project for the redesign and improvement of the pipe bundle involved in the accident.The company has complied with the requests, by presenting the project in two phases, NOF which has been already approved by the Regional Technical Committee, and the detailed project which is under examination.Seveso II duties  - remarks:The 2005 safety Report foresaw an accident scenario similar to the one occurred, i.e. the rupture of a gasoline and/or LPG pipeline forming part of a pipe bundle inside a trench in-between a subway and the railway. For the rupture of a gasoline pipe the extension of the damage area had been estimated in maximally 30m, corresponding to a heat irradiation of 3kw/m2 (reversible damage area), involving either road ex SS114 and the railway depending from the source location. Therefore the effects of the heat irradiation foreseen in the accident scenario of the Safety Report are compatible with the effects of the accident which occurred really.The management faults occurred during the event, i.e. the faulty application of the emergency response procedures foreseen in the onsite emergency response plan, points out the need to improve the training of the personnel, with a particular focus on emergency management.Following the event the Regional Technical Committee has delivered the technical feasibility authorisation concerning the reconstruction of the pipe bundle and the repair of the subway (resolution n\u00b0 87&nbsp;&nbsp; 12/12/06). In March 2007 the company has presented the safety report on the detailed project phase.The municipality of Priolo has not requested the information necessary to prepare a Ajor Accident Report according to DM 9 May 2001.",
        "Lesson Learned": "Immediate lessons:&nbsp; Critical equipment aspects encountered onsite the establishment immediately after the accident:\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pipe bundle disposition inside the trench and also inside the\nsubway was such to cause extreme difficulties during the emergency\nresponse operations;\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;there was a large number of closely packed pipes, containing\ndifferent kinds of liquids (and in particular hazardous ones), which\nwere not immediately identifiable and traceable;\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the presence and vicinity in the same bundle of pipes containing\nhazardous substances and pipes with high pressure/temperature steam\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mix up of the pipe lay-out of utility pipes (and in particular the\nextinguishing water pipe) with the product transfer pipes, this\ncircumstance has caused the overpressure in the isolated pipe tract\nexposed to the heat irradiation from the fire and the consequent\nexplosion of the pipes and interrupted the extinguishing water supply\nfrom the pipe inside the bundle and damaged also another suspended\nextinguishing water pipe crossing the pipe bundle;\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high hold-up levels of the tube bundle, due to the reduced number isolating valves on the pipe-lines;\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inadequate gradient arrangement, absence of retaining curbs and of adequate water drainage systems.\n\nCritical management aspects found: \n- Incomplete compliance with the Onsite Emergency Plan: The onsite\nfire-brigade was alerted&nbsp; only three hours after the crude oil leak\ndetection.\n- age (more than 25 years) and state of conservation of the pipe\ntriggering the event, with respect to progressive corrosion processes\nencountered, which finally caused the leak;.\nThe company stated that periodical inspections had been performed\naccording to the technical \"Piping inspection code\" API 570 on the\nevent triggering pipe;\nThese periodical inspections were part of the establishment's\nmaintenance program ERG-MED, according to which the last inspection on\nthe above mentioned pipe had been performed in February 2005. \nFollowing the accident the company asked the specialist American\ncompany Fluor Daniel to assess the inspection methodology employed by\nthe company and to propose possible improvements.\n\nThe company has realised following structural measures on the installation, with respect to the above mentioned aspects:\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; total reconstruction of the pipe bundle over a length of 300 m,\naccording to a project integrating the requests formulated by the\nTechnical Regional Committee of Sicily (resolution CTR dated\n05/05/2006) and additional considerations formulated by the company.\nThe reconstruction and modification project was divided in several phases:\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phase 1: reactivation of the product loading - unloading wharf\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phase 2: start up of the pipe lines and plant parts which were not damaged or functionally affected by the fire.\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        "Accident Description": "Release of bromine from a pipe belonging to a rail tanker unloading station.",
        "Causes of the accident": "The bromine release was caused by a pipe connection which had not been closed.At the beginning of the transfer operation, after passing the highest point of the pipe, the bromine flowed under normal atmospheric pressure, as a small stream, down to the junction point, hitting a blind shutter, which was attached to a neighbouring valve. Immediately after the bromine release, a watchman activated the emergency stop. The shut-off valve closed within approx. 3 s. Only that part of the bromine was released which had already passed the highest point of the pipe.The bromine was collected by bottom containment system. After 30-40 s the fire fighting team could stop the evaporation of the bromine by covering the bromine with a layer of water.At 13:46, another alarm was released.The pipe section between the highest point of the pipe and the rail tanker was still filled with bromine. It is not known whether at this time any bromine had already penetrated into the double wall jacket. The leak check pipe ruptured. The leak was sealed with a blind flange (seal plate). 5-10 l of bromine were released, while due to the immediate measures taken by the fire fighting team abatement of the vapour) only a small fraction of the bromine was dispersed in the air.The released bromine was caught together with the water in the rail spill-containment system and in the containment system of the neighbouring hydrochloric acid tanks, so that it was not absorbed by the ground.In the meantime, the pressure in the rail tanker was reduced using a gas washer of a lithium bromide installation. Almost no bromine was released during this process. Subsequently, the remaining content of the inner pipe of the double wall pipe was transferred into the rail tanker. This reduced the hazards. According to a worst case scenario, at his time there were still ca. 30 l of bromine in the double wall jacket.The bromine inside the wagon was strongly heated by the sun shining on the black PE (polyethylene) double wall pipe. There was the risk of a rupture of the PE box near the shut-off valve. An attempt to reduce the pressure on the emptying valve before a receiving arm by shortly opening was aborted, because of the high temperature of the bromine a strong spontaneous evaporation occurred. Massive use of water avoided the diffusion of bromine vapour. After this emptying through a pipe connecting piece was chosen. Since mechanical strength (resistance) was not granted during the whole duration of the operation, additionally a funnel was placed underneath. During opening of the valve the pipe connecting piece broke off. Subsequently, the double jacket was washed with sodium sulphate solution. During this operation, there was a minor release of bromine, because a blind flange (seal pipe) had to be opened.",
        "Consequences": "Off-site the concentrations were in the limits of the MAK- values and were therefore not critical for the population. A smell nuisance occurred and some persons suffered from inflammation of the eyes and the mucous membranes.\nMaterial loss  was quantified in 1500 EURO.",
        "Emergency response": "The bromine was caught over a bottom containment system. After 30-40 s the fire fighting team could stop the evaporation of the bromine by covering the bromine with a layer of water. Another leak was sealed with a blind flange (seal plate). 5-10 l of bromine were released, while due to the immediate measures taken by the fire fighting team (abatement of the vapour) only a small fraction of the bromine was dispersed in the air.\nThe released bromine was caught together with the water in the rail spill-containment system and in the containment system of the neighbouring hydrochloric acid tanks, so that it was not absorbed by the ground.",

        "Consequences": "The consequences of the accident were: evacuation of 146 people from the nearest neighbourhood; combustion of 400 kg of dibenzoyl peroxide 75% and 3 000 kg of dibenzoyl peroxide 50% with dicyclohexyl phthalate; damages on site:&nbsp; c.a. 1 000 000 Euro.",
        "Emergency response": "Emergency action was conducted by the Fire Service. Activities consisted in providing 3 currents of water in attack and 1 current in defense. The currents of water were directed to the part of the hall, where the drying process of benzoyl peroxide and tanks with a benzoyl water slurry followed, while the current in defense was directed to the reactors. After the arrival of additional forces and measures, the activities have expanded to include 9 water currents and 2 froth currents. These activities contributed to extinguishing the fire. The next actions consisted of cooling the production line for benzoyl peroxide and trays in the dryer. Before the arrival of the Fire Service, 41 employees were evacuated from the establishment. In addition, the company's employees, at the beginning of the fire, moved the pallet containers with benzoyl chloride to a safe place, which were placed directly next to the hall (about 10 pieces). The residents of the neighbouring Social Welfare Home were evacuated and moved to a safe place. The evacuation began at 10:00 am and ended at 2:45 pm.

        "Accident Description": "Failure to close a valve after earlier loading of butane. As a result 50 tons of butane escaped.",
        "Causes of the accident": "Human cause, unclear markings caused confusion on whether the valve was open or shut.A temporary employee, who had only been working in the company since a short period of time, first of all CLOSED the valve under supervision of his mentor. After a while the temporary employee returned without his mentor. Since he had doubts if the valve was really closed he turned it a second time. At that time he thought he closed it, but in fact with this action he OPENED valve again activating the alarm. He then decided to turn the valve a third time. Now the valve was CLOSED. What he did not know was that there is always a (minor) delay in the decrease of pressure in the pipeline because of which the alarm bells continue to go off for a short time.Some background information: The pipeline is some hundred meters long and&nbsp; there is still some pressure on the pipe immediately after changes in the valves. In other words there is always a certain delay when closing the pipe due to which the pressure appears high in a small part of the pipeline. One has to take this delay into account.He then asked for assistance of the mentor. (The mentor had not been present when the temporary employee had opened and closed&nbsp; the valve a couple of times.) They decided to turn the valve a fourth time thinking it would close it, but actually OPENING it. And -most importantly- they turned off the alarm. Not taking into account the alarm had only went off because of the delay in the pipe line. To sum up, the status of the valve when they left was 'OPEN' and the alarm bells did NOT go off since they had been turned off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did this confusion about opening or closing the valve occur? Two years prior to this accident a similar accident had happened. The correction that was applied after that accident was the following: a warning sign with the word 'OPEN' was placed over the valve (in other words it covered the valve). However, in a closed situation the warning sign showed the word 'open' and in an open situation the sign showed the word 'open' as well. The only difference was that in an open situation the word 'open' was read vertically and in a closed situation horizontally. Hence, the improvement/correction that was made due to the accident that had happened 2 years before caused even more confusion for someone that did not know the practical reason behind it. This 'opening and closing' should have been noticed in BP's control room, but did not result in any action since the alarm had been turned off (see above). ",
        "Consequences": "The release of butane caused material loss for the owner of the plant, but no cost data availableIn total approximately 55 people at risk (establishment population and emergency personnel)Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment",
        "Emergency response": "An external company was present/was working at the site in December 23rd 2003. Approximately at 5am they heard a noise and noticed that butane was escaping. Because of a heavy storm they did not hear the escape of butane before that time. The external company warned the BP- people present resulting in a shut down of the machinery. BP people contacted the firebrigade (external service) who did a gas detection measurement. Official action taken - legal action: The company is situated in the province of Noord- Holland in the Netherlands. The province has undertaken judicial action against the company. In 2004 this resulted in a settlement with the public attorney.Official action taken - other official action: A technical investigation by the labour Inspectorate concerning the cause of the accident and the measures taken. ",
        "Lesson Learned": "Measures to prevent recurrence: \nFirst of all, the BP main office (in the UK) has started an internal investigation about the incident also taking into account a similar accident that had happened some years before at BP in the Netherlands. \n\nFurthermore, BP has decided to:\n1) Improve the training on the job for all employees;\n2) Install a double valve on the pipe;\n3) Review current procedures.
