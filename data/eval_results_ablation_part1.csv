A short circuit exposed the exhaust air pipe (above the defective fluorescent tube), linked to the  ventilation system of the equipment, to thermal stress. The energy released by the catalytic reaction of Pt-, Pd-, Rh- salts/dust deposits in the exhaust air pipe set the whole pipe on fire. The exhaust air ventilator on fifth floor pulled the fire upstairs overriding the fire dampers.On 06/07/00 a fire occurred in an intermediate ceiling of the second floor of the installation in question.The professional fire brigade and the onsite firefighting service were notified at the same time. The fire was extinguished rapidly and was declared extinguished.During the subsequent control smoke was detected at the door on the second floor leading to the ventilation shaft. After opening the door it appeared that a fire was spreading rapidly towards the ventilation control station in the fifth floor.On the roof of the five storey building the openings of the ventilation system are located.In the north-eastern zone of the building (contact area with the neighbouring building) the development of strong smoke was detected. The smoke cloud was approximately 150-300 m high and shifted slowly towards north-east (an industrial park area).Measurements were performed around 07:25. The measurements were focused on the detection of&nbsp;&nbsp; HCN, HCL, and ammonia gases in the immediate surroundings of the burning building. All measurements were negative.On request of the Environmental Protection Agency (Umweltbundesamt), the measurements were repeated at 08:25. The measurements at the adjoining industrial park resulted in a HCL gas concentration of 20 ppm. The ERPG-2 threshold limit was therefore exceeded and the D3-notification level was released. Due to the wind direction, at no stage was the population exposed to risk. However, there was a health hazard for the employees of the industrial park, due to the high HCL gas concentration.The fire was under control around 10:00 hrs, at 11:15 hrs it was extinguished.

The worker reached the area with a portable extinguisher and gas mask and found two rows of 1 tonne bags containing anhydrous sodium dichlorisocyanurate on the extreme left of the area and placed at a distance of 50 cm from each other. He could distinguish two piles of big bags in the front and another two big bags on the ground a bit more to the right. He declared that he could see smoke rising from the wooden pallet placed under the bag pile and the bottom bag on the right. He emptied the portable extinguisher, found another two and emptied them too but could not stop the combustion process and smoke development.The product leaking from the big bag at the bottom of the pile caused the two bags above to crash on the ground, feeding the combustion process, developing flames and intensive smoke.Meanwhile two other workers who had been alerted by the main alarm siren of the chlorine detectors reached the area shortly after the first worker and the shift supervisor sent them to the chlorine storage area.&nbsp; They connected an extinguishing hose to the manifold of two pumps feeding from two 10m3 water tanks, which were used for operations under normal conditions. The tanks are located approximately 20 metres from the area affected by the fire. Shortly after the extinguishing hose had been connected and a small amount of water had been&nbsp; pumped, the two pumps failed because the flames had reached the electric cable rack suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground and passing parallel to the front side of the transit area (located above the passage of the drainage channel). When the shift supervisor realised that the emergency response operation was impossible he alerted the security personnel of the plant and attempted to alert the fire brigade and the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (Centro de Emergencias de Catalunya - CECAT) but the telephone line was interrupted due to the fact that the telephone line also passes above the area in which the fire broke out.One of the workers, looking for a telephone, tried to kick open the entrance door of the administration offices but broke the glass with his foot and cut his leg (the injury was considered as not serious).At 20:43 hrs the emergency call number 112 received a phone call from a private citizen informing them that a fire had broken out in an industrial installation and the information was transmitted to the fire brigade.When local police officers of the Catalonian autonomous police force (Mossos d\'Esquadra) arrived&nbsp; at the plant entrance and saw flames and smoke rising, they alerted the fire brigade.At 20:51 hrs a fire brigade helicopter making a routine flight over the area reported that the size of the smoke cloud was large and that chlorine could be smelled.The safety manager of the company arrived and at 20:58 hrs alerted the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (CECAT), responsible for releasing the Off-site Emergency Plan, informing them that the fire was significant and that it was releasing chlorine into the atmosphere.At 20:50 hrs the fire brigade arrived on-site, the fire brigade was informed by the representatives of the operator about the fire, the release of chlorine and the need to employ self-contained breathing apparatus. The fire was spreading rapidly, affecting the installations passing through the roofing and the roofing panels of the transit area. At 20:58 hrs, after extinguishing operations had been started, the chief officer of the fire brigade informed the Control Room that a chlorine cloud was forming.At 21:05 hrs the officer requested activation of the off-site emergency response plan.At 21:11 hrs the off-site emergency plan was activated, the municipalities located downwind and potentially affected by the cloud were informed about the occurrence and were requested to alert the population to immediately take shelter.The first fire fighters reaching the site found one extinguishing system of the company out of order due to a missing pressure device.At 21:49 hrs the fire was extinguished and the control room was notified.At 22:15 hrs the on-site emergency&nbsp; plan was called off andAt 23:00 hrs the off-site emergency&nbsp; plan was called off."", ""causes_of_accident"": ""Combustion of sodium dichlorisocyanurate ( SDIC, dichloroisocyanuric acid sodium salt CAS 2893-78-9) and production of toxic fumes containing chlorine.

Moreover they all report\\u00a0 having seen sodium dichlorisocyanurate react with trichlorocyanuric acid (TCCA) with fuel or water in the processing area. Consequently although risks were known the safety measures taken were not sufficiently effective.\\u00b7\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0The installation did not comply with the regulations set out by the current legislation according to the results of the inspections foreseen for Major Accident Hazard installations, although the non-compliance did not concern classified substances. Although the operator was still within the terms for the corrective measures set out following the inspection, but not all of them, it has to be said that this does not exempt the operator from the exclusive responsibility with regards to the non-compliance with the applicable regulations as from the date these regulations were implemented in Spanish law.Measures to mitigate consequences: The lack of an extinguishing water system independent of the process, although not obligatory, associated with the failure of the electric cable system led to the plant not being able to respond to the emergency\\u00a0 with its own means, having\\u00a0 to depend completely on external emergency response services and fire brigades.Alternative systems are being studied.Useful references:The medical services reported that no patients were treated for the effects of the toxic cloud but complaints concerning irritation to eyes and respiratory tract were received by local police officers of adjacent municipalities and by the emergency number 112. This leads us to suppose that the smoke cloud was at such a height not to affect the population of the rural area nearest to the plant, in which there are farm buildings. When the smoke cooled down and reached the ground it was sufficiently diluted not to cause any severe health consequences to people.The fact that the population living in the vicinity was alerted and requested to take shelter in their homes and to close doors and windows certainly contributed to reducing the consequences of this event."", ""url"": ""https://emars.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/emars/accident/view/bd785f25-2bb4-a909-6118-f598b7351cbd""}', '{""accident_id"": 462, ""event_type"": ""Major Accident"", ""industry_type"": ""Leisure and sport activities (e.g. ice rink)"", ""accident_title"": ""Release of chlorine in a public swimming pool due to erroneous mixture of isocyanuric acid and water"", ""start_date"": ""1995-11-07 08:30:00"", ""finish_date"": ""1995-11-07 00:00:00"", ""accident_description"": ""41 schoolchildren intoxicated"", ""causes_of_accident"": ""wrong handlingnot appropriate (wrong, erroneous) mixture isocyanuric acid and water"", ""consequences"": ""Release of chlorine in the premises (rooms) used by the sportsmen (visitors)Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment"", ""emergency_response"": ""Evacuation of the persons, medical examination and hospitalisation of 7 persons between them for observation during 1 dayEmergency measures - Remarks: The person in charge has controlled (supervised) the reaction until its exhaustion (end), protecting himself with a gas mask.Official action taken - legal action: Reexamination (analysis) of the labelling of the reaction products and of the (written) operation instructions of the chlorine generator.

In the event of a cooling system failure in reactive processes, it is crucial to respond promptly and effectively to prevent a runaway reaction. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Shut down the reaction**: If possible, immediately shut down the reaction to prevent further escalation.
2. **Cool the reactor**: Use alternative cooling methods, such as water or air, to cool the reactor as quickly as possible.
3. **Monitor the reaction**: Continuously monitor the reaction temperature, pressure, and other parameters to ensure the situation is under control.
4. **Evacuate the area**: If necessary, evacuate the surrounding area to prevent exposure to hazardous materials or gases.
5. **Activate emergency procedures**: Activate emergency procedures, such as emergency shutdown protocols, to minimize the risk of a major accident.

It is essential to have a well-rehearsed emergency response plan in place, including training for operators and maintenance personnel, to ensure a swift and effective response in the event of a cooling system failure.

The shelter housed a grinding mill (not in use at the time of the explosion) and a concrete mixer used for fine milling charcoal. Carbon dust is used in the production of the colouring mixtures used to make fireworks. According to the operator\'s statement, the only operation in progress in the area was the fine milling of charcoal. It is presumed that the explosion occurred as a result of ignition of the carbon dust in suspension in the free space of the mixer."", ""causes_of_accident"": ""At approximately 10.51&nbsp;a.m., combustible material ignited by the fire swept through an area about 250 m away from the factory entrance.

Ruling out inappropriate behaviour by the operators and taking into consideration the favourable weather conditions: a dry, cold winter\'s day, one possible scenario is that the accumulated static electricity in the clothing of one of the operators may have generated a spark when he was checking on the fineness of the coal dust, thereby triggering the explosion. There was no formal procedure in place stipulating the use of special specific antistatic clothing for that type of processing or requiring that particular attention be paid to equalising the electrical potential between the equipment and the operator before work was carried out on the machine (loading, checking, emptying operations).

However, please note that the context only includes a few incident records, and it's not possible to provide a comprehensive answer on signs of imminent equipment failure.

From the provided records, I can identify some common signs of potential equipment failure:

* In the ""Chlorine leak from a railcar due to uncontrolled reaction of impurities"" incident, the formation of phenol-formaldehyde resins in batch reactors is known for potential runaway reactions, indicating a potential for equipment failure.
* In the ""Leakage of natural gas at a methane terminal"" incident, a worker forgot to close a purge valve, leading to a leak. This highlights the importance of proper maintenance and monitoring of equipment to prevent potential failures.
* In the ""Fire at a car component supplier"" incident, the incorrect direction of rotation of a motor led to a fire. This suggests that improper maintenance or installation of equipment can lead to potential failures.

It's essential to note that these incidents are specific and may not be representative of all equipment failure scenarios. A comprehensive answer on signs of imminent equipment failure would require a broader dataset and analysis.

In general, signs of imminent equipment failure can include:

* Unusual noises or vibrations
* Increased temperature or pressure
* Leaks or unusual odors
* Malfunctioning or erratic behavior
* Unusual wear or damage

Here are the relevant responses:

1. In Incident 1124, the automatic fire alarm triggered the factory alarm, and the professional fire brigade attended the site in response. However, their access to the site was delayed due to the works gate not being connected to the emergency power supply.
2. In Incident 1095, the automatic extinction system (inert gas cylinders) was used to support the internal emergency teams in responding to the fire.

In general, when responding to an automatic fire suppression system failure, it is essential to:

* Identify the cause of the failure and take corrective action
* Ensure that the fire is contained and not spreading
* Activate backup systems or manual firefighting measures if necessary
* Evacuate the area if the situation is deemed unsafe
* Notify the relevant authorities and emergency services

It is also important to investigate the root cause of the failure to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.","Establish fire watch, notify maintenance, verify backup systems, prepare manual firefighting equipment, restrict hot work, monitor area, maintain communication with emergency team",0.3333333333,0.0,0.9631674341449448,0.3684210526315789
