What emergency procedures are needed for power failure?,"['{""accident_id"": 1209, ""event_type"": ""Near Miss"", ""industry_type"": ""Chemical installations "", ""accident_title"": ""Release of hydrogen fluoride following power failure at a hydrofluoric acid plant"", ""start_date"": ""2019-10-30 03:50:00"", ""finish_date"": ""2019-10-30 08:40:00"", ""accident_description"": ""Power failure in the Trafogruppe 3 hydrofluoric acid plant caused by a hardware error in an S5 remote control system, with subsequent failure of the visualisation systems and manual plant shutdown.\\nA resulting increase in pressure in a hydrogen fluoride (HF) drum to over 10 mbar led to the release of HF in the production hall. This was condensed using a deluge system (inside the production building).\\nTaking into account the effectiveness of the exhaust gas scrubber and the exhaust gas fans \\u2013 which could be kept powered and in operation throughout the incident apart from the short interruption between the central power failure and the manual switchover to the emergency diesel generator \\u2013 as well as the monitors (outside the buildings), the additional water curtain installed by the plant fire service and the readings of the emission measurement device before the stack, the total amount of HF emitted to the atmosphere can be estimated at 2.6 kg.\\nThe emission measurement device can display four digits, up to 9,999 mg/m\\u00b3, with deviations of less than 10%.

The UPS would have been necessary for the automatic transfer of consumers to the emergency power supply. Instead, this had to be done manually. In addition, the manual switch for the emergency coolant supply failed. The continuous HF vapours (up to 2,700 kg in total over approximately 4 hours following the cut-off of the raw materials) had to be absorbed in the operational exhaust gas scrubber in the end, as the emergency scrubber installed for such an event did not work due to the non-opening butterfly valve in the inlet pipe.\\nThe spread of these HF vapours was prevented by condensing using stationary process water monitors and water curtains provided by the plant fire service.
