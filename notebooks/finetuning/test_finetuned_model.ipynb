Inadequate mixing may cause larger particles settle at the bottom sludge tank. Thus sludge gets concentrated towards bottom leading overflows\n",

      "An automatic fire suppression system is designed to detect fires quickly and respond effectively. However, if the system fails, it's essential to take immediate action to ensure everyone's safety. Here's how you can respond:\n",
      "  1. Check the system's operation : Ensure the system is switched off to prevent any unintended activation. Check the system's control panel or indicator lights to confirm it's disabled.\n",
      "  2. Evacuate the building : In case the system is malfunctioning, evacuate everyone in the building immediately. Don't take risks waiting for the situation to resolve.\n",
      "  3. Call the emergency services : Notify the local emergency services, fire department, or building management immediately. Provide information about the situation, including the type of building, number of people present, and details about the fire suppression system failure.\n",
      "  4. Investigate the cause : Determine the reason behind the system failure. This might involve inspecting electrical components, checking for malfunctions, or reviewing maintenance records.\n",
      "  5. Implement temporary measures : In case the system cannot be restored immediately, consider installing temporary fire suppression systems or using portable fire extinguishers.\n",
      "  6. Follow repair procedures : Adhere manufacturer guidelines or established protocols for repairing and maintaining the fire suppression system. Hire a professional if necessary.\n",
      "  7. Review safety procedures : Use the incident as an opportunity to assess and improve building safety procedures. Identify areas where processes could be optimized or improved.\n",
      "  8. Update records : Record the incident, including the cause, response, and outcome. Update system maintenance records accordingly.\n",
